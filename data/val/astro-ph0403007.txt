    "the abundance and spectra of most ions observed in impulsive solar energetic particle events ( seps ) qualitatively agree with predictions of stochastic acceleration ( sa ) by plasma waves or turbulence ( pwt ) ( e.g. mbius et al . 1980 ; 1982 ) . however , the observed enrichment of @xmath0he , sometimes by more than four orders of magnitude over its coronal abundance ( hsieh & simpson 1970 ; serlemitsos & balasubrahmanyan 1975 ; mason et al .",
    "2002 ) , remains a theoretical challenge .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an explanation for this observation in the frame of sa models .",
    "solar @xmath0he rich events are enriched also in other heavy elements ( hurford et al .",
    "1975 ; mason et al . 1986 ) and are closely related to impulsive x - ray flares , scatter - free electron events , and type iii radio bursts ( reames , von rosenvinge & lin 1985 ; reames , meyer & von rosenvinge 1994 ; mazur , mason & klecker 1995 ; mason et al .",
    "2002 ) , indicating that a common particle acceleration process may be responsible for all these features . among the acceleration mechanisms applied to solar flares ,",
    "the theory of sa , a second order fermi acceleration process by pwt , has achieved several significant successes .",
    "the theory was first introduced to account for the acceleration of protons and other ions responsible for the observed nuclear gamma ray line emissions ( ramaty 1979 ; hua , ramaty & lingenfelter 1989 ) .",
    "later it was shown that it is also applicable to the acceleration of electrons , which produce the impulsive hard x - ray emission ( miller & ramaty 1987 ; hamilton & petrosian 1992 ; park , petrosian & schwartz 1997 ; petrosian & donaghy 1999 ) .",
    "a recent study of sa by cascading alfvn turbulence indicated that it may also explain heavy ion acceleration as well ( miller 2003 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that the enrichment of @xmath0he is related to its peculiar charge to mass ratio so that certain plasma waves resonantly accelerate or heat it to high energies , producing the observed abundance ratio at a few mev nucleon@xmath3 ( mbius et al .",
    "1980 ; zhang 1999 ) .",
    "previous work either discusses the feasibility of selective accelerating @xmath0he from very low energies ( temerin & roth 1992 ; miller & vias 1993 ) , or considers a two - stage mechanism ; a selective preheating process followed by an acceleration applicable to all ions ( fisk 1978 ) .",
    "the former can not be compared with observation directly because the acceleration of other ions has not been addressed accordingly . for the latter ,",
    "the observed abundance pattern at high energies is determined by the preheating processes ( paesold , kartavykh & benz 2003 ) and the predicted spectrum depends on several parameters with the corresponding physical processes unspecified ( sakurai 1974 ; zhang 1995 ) .",
    "given its simple dispersion relation , alfvn turbulence is used in most of the sa models ( ramaty 1979 ; mbius et al .",
    "1982 ) , which can not explain the varied ion spectral forms and underestimates the production rate of higher energy particles in disagreement with the recent observations by the _",
    "advanced composition explorer _",
    "( _ ace _ ; mason et al .",
    "however , low energy particles mostly interact with cyclotron and/or whistler waves .",
    "to understand the acceleration of particles from a thermal background , it is necessary to use the exact dispersion relation ( steinacker et al .",
    "we have carried out such an investigation recently , which addresses the acceleration of electrons vs protons by waves propagating parallel to magnetic field lines ( petrosian & liu 04 , pl04 for short ) . besides its achievements in explaining many features of solar flares , we found that the acceleration of low energy protons can be suppressed significantly relative to the electron acceleration due to the dominance of the wave - proton interaction by the resonant alfvn mode .    in this letter , we show that a similar mechanism makes the acceleration of low energy @xmath0he much more favorable relative to that of @xmath1he .",
    "because their loss rates are comparable , such a mechanism basically depletes @xmath0he from the thermal background to @xmath5 mev energies while most of the @xmath1he ions are `` trapped '' at low energies , resulting a prominent quasi - thermal @xmath1he component . the model not only explains the enrichment of @xmath0he at a few mev nucleon@xmath3 , but also accounts for the flattening of the @xmath0he spectrum at lower energies ( mason , dwyer & mazur 2000 ; mason et al .",
    "it also predicts that beyond a few mev nucleon@xmath3 the spectrum of @xmath1he is always harder than the @xmath0he spectrum . in the next section ,",
    "we present our sa model .",
    "its application to seps is discussed in   [ seps ] . in   [ sum ] , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "the theory of sa by parallel propagating waves is explored in detail in pl04 . here , we highlight a few key points , which are crucial in understanding the ion acceleration process .",
    "first , a magnetized plasma can be characterized by the ratio of the electron plasma frequency @xmath6 to gyrofrequency @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron number density and @xmath10 is the large scale magnetic field . to describe the wave modes in the plasma , one also needs to know the abundance of ions . in our case ,",
    "the inclusion of @xmath11-particle , whose number density is about @xmath12 of the proton density , is essential while other heavier elements have little effect on the dispersion relation @xmath13 ( steinacker et al .",
    "1997 ) , where @xmath14 is the wave frequency and @xmath15 is the wavenumber .",
    "low energy ions mostly interact with left - handed polarized waves .",
    "figure [ fig : disp ] shows the dispersion relation of these wave modes as indicated by the dotted curves in a plasma with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the abundance of @xmath11-particle ( here following the notation in pl04 , negative frequencies indicate that the waves are left - handed polarized ) .",
    "there are two distinct branches , which we call @xmath1he - cyclotron branch ( hec : upper one ) and proton - cyclotron branch ( pc : lower one ) because they asymptotically approach the corresponding ion cyclotron waves at large wavenumbers . at small @xmath15",
    ", hec branch gives the alfvn waves , while the pc branch approaches a wave frequency @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the proton gyrofrequency .",
    "the acceleration process is determined by the resonant wave - particle interaction .",
    "the waves and particles couple strongly when the resonant condition @xmath21 is satisfied , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are respectively the velocity , the pitch angle cosine , the nonrelativistic gyrofrequency , and the lorentz factor of the ions .",
    "figure [ fig : disp ] also shows this resonant condition ( straight lines ) for @xmath0he and @xmath1he with @xmath26 and two values of energy : @xmath27 kev per nucleon .",
    "the intersection points of these lines with the dotted curves for the dispersion relation satisfy the resonant condition and indicate strong wave - particle couplings .",
    "the wave - particle interaction rates are calculated by adding contributions from these points ( pl04 ) .    at low energies",
    "( e.g. @xmath28 kev nucleon@xmath3 in the figure ) @xmath1he interacts only with two waves , one from the hec and one from pc ( not shown in the figure because of its large wavenumber ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0he can interact with four waves , three of them from the pc branch ( two of them are shown in the figure ) and one from the hec branch ( also not shown in the figure ) . as shown in figure [ fig : disp ] there are two resonant modes for @xmath0he with nearly equal and small wavenumbers while @xmath1he has one resonant mode at low k ( see circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] ) ; the next important resonant mode of @xmath1he is at much larger k value beyond the range of the figure .",
    "consequently , for a power law spectrum of turbulence , the interaction of low energy @xmath1he will be dominated by a single mode from the hec branch , giving rise to a very low acceleration rate relative to @xmath0he ( see discussion below ) pitch angle ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , this contributes little to the acceleration as a whole because there are few such particles ] .",
    "this is not true for particles with high energies ( @xmath30 kev nucleon@xmath3 in the figure ) . for these particles ,",
    "the two stronger resonant modes have comparable contributions for both ions .    following previous studies ( dung & petrosian 1994 ; pl04 )",
    ", we will assume that the turbulence has a power law spectrum @xmath31 with a low wavenumber cutoff @xmath32 , which corresponds to the turbulence generation scale and determines the maximum energy of the accelerated particles .",
    "for a turbulence spectral index @xmath33 , a high wavenumber cutoff is also required to ensure the convergence of the total turbulence energy density . in this case , we choose @xmath34 large enough so that the acceleration of particles from the thermal background is not affected by this cutoff .",
    "then the characteristic interaction time scale @xmath35 is given by @xmath36\\cases{(q-1)k_{\\rm min}^{q-1 } , &   for $ q>1 $ ; \\cr [ \\ln{(k_{\\rm max}/k_{\\rm min})}]^{-1 } , & for $ q=1 $ ; \\cr ( 1-q)k_{\\rm max}^{q-1 } , & for $ q<1 $ ; } \\label{taup}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the total turbulence energy density .",
    "ions in a turbulent plasma can gain energy by interacting with the waves with diffusion coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the momentum of the particles , and lose energy via coulomb collisions with electrons and protons in the thermal background . as a result the particles diffuse in both real and momentum space .",
    "the spatial diffusion can be approximated with an escape term with a time scale @xmath42 .",
    "because the coulomb scattering rate at low energies and the pitch angle scattering rate @xmath40 at high energies are larger than the acceleration rate ( except for highly magnetized plasmas with @xmath43 ) , the particle distribution is nearly isotropic over all energies .",
    "the energy diffusion rate @xmath44 ( see schlickeiser 1989 ; dung & petrosian 1994 ) .",
    "as stressed in pl04 , when the interaction is dominated by one of the resonant modes , this rate becomes negligibly small and the particle acceleration is suppressed . in pl04 , we showed that such a suppression occurs for low energy protons but not for electrons .",
    "as mentioned above at low energies the @xmath1he interaction is dominated by one mode resulting in a low acceleration rate relative to @xmath0he . for isotropic pitch angle distribution ,",
    "the particle distribution integrated over the acceleration region , @xmath45 , as a function of the total ( not per nucleon ) kinetic energy @xmath46 , satisfies the well known diffusion - convection equation : @xmath47 -{n\\over t_{\\rm esc } } + q\\ , ,   \\label{dceq}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the pitch angle averaged diffusion rate , @xmath49 is a source term , and the loss rate @xmath50 is given in pl04 .",
    "figure [ fig : times ] shows the relevant time scales for a model with @xmath51 cm , @xmath52 gauss , @xmath53 @xmath54 and temperature @xmath55 kev .",
    "the turbulence spectral index @xmath56 , @xmath57 s@xmath3 and @xmath58 . the acceleration and loss times are defined as : @xmath59 depending on @xmath60 , @xmath35 and @xmath46 , either the transit time @xmath61 or the diffusion time @xmath62 can dominate the escaping process , where @xmath63 is the scattering time including both wave - particle scatterings and particle - particle collisions .",
    "we define @xmath64 which incorporates both processes of escape .",
    "there are several features in these times , which require particular attention :    first , all the time scales are energy dependent and the acceleration times have complicated forms , in contrast to the often used simplified acceleration by pure alfvn turbulence and/or with energy independent escape time .",
    "this affects the spectral shapes significantly .",
    "second , the typical time scale varies from less than one second to hundreds of seconds with different processes dominating at different energies .",
    "third , the acceleration times for @xmath1he and @xmath0he are quite different due to interaction with different waves , while their escape and loss times are similar because these times are dominated by coulomb collisions and wave - particle scatterings ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "fourth , the acceleration time of @xmath0he is shorter than the coulomb loss time below a few hundreds of kev nucleon@xmath3 .",
    "consequently , for a background plasma of a few million kelvin almost all the injected @xmath0he can be accelerated to high energies ( a few mev nucleon@xmath3 ) . above this energy",
    "the escape time becomes shorter than the acceleration time and the acceleration is quenched .",
    "fifth , @xmath1he acceleration time increases sharply with the decrease of energy near 100 kev nucleon@xmath3 .",
    "this is because at lower energies the wave - particle interaction is dominated by one of the resonant modes .",
    "@xmath1he acceleration time starts to decrease with energy near 50 kev nucleon@xmath3 where the two resonant waves have comparable wavenumber ( figure [ fig : disp ] ) .",
    "because the acceleration time is longer than the loss time at low energies , for an injection plasma with a temperature less than @xmath66 k , only a small fraction of @xmath1he in the maxwellian tail can be accelerated to very high energies .",
    "the rest is heated up into a quasi - thermal distribution .",
    "sixth , the acceleration time of @xmath1he is shorter than that of @xmath0he above @xmath2 kev nucleon@xmath3 , so that the @xmath1he acceleration becomes more efficient at these energies .",
    "because the duration of seps are much longer than the characteristic time scales discussed in the previous section , we will assume that the system reaches a steady state .",
    "one can then ignore the time derivative term in equation ( [ dceq ] ) and solve this equation for the escaping flux @xmath67 , which can be directly compared with the observed fluences .",
    "figure [ fig : spec1 ] shows our model fit to the spectra of an sep event on january 6 , 2000 , the event with the largest @xmath0he enrichment ( mason et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the data are obtained by carefully subtracting the background and avoiding contaminations from nearby events . for the model spectra",
    ", we assume that the injected plasma has a coronal abundance , i.e. the abundance of @xmath1he is two thousand times higher than that of @xmath0he .",
    "the model parameters are the same as those in figure [ fig : times ] .",
    "the temperature of 0.2 kev is a typical value for impulsive sep events ( reames et al .",
    "because the acceleration region is connected to open magnetic field lines probably above the flaring coronal loops , a size of @xmath68 cm seems quite reasonable .",
    "the magnetic field and gas density are also characteristic of an upper coronal reconnection region .",
    "the turbulence parameters @xmath69 and @xmath35 are free model parameters .",
    "the model not only accounts for the enrichment of @xmath0he , but also gives a reasonable fit to the spectra .",
    "because at low energies the acceleration time of @xmath0he is shorter than any other times , almost all of the injected @xmath0he ions are accelerated to a few hundreds of kev nucleon@xmath3 , where @xmath70 becomes longer than the loss and escape time , resulting in a sharp cutoff .",
    "the @xmath1he acceleration time , because of the barrier mentioned above , is much longer than its loss time below a few kev nucleon@xmath3 .",
    "this suppresses the @xmath1he acceleration so that most of the injected @xmath1he ions remain near the injection energy and form a quasi - thermal component .",
    "however , even when @xmath71 and the direct acceleration is difficult , some @xmath1he ions can still diffuse to high energies due to the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ dceq ] ) .",
    "consequently , we expect a nonthermal tail in addition to the quasi - thermal component .",
    "this tail is cut off at @xmath72 mev nucleon@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1 ] ) , when the escape time becomes much shorter than the acceleration time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] ) .",
    "the acceleration barrier extends to @xmath2 kev nucleon@xmath3 , most of the @xmath1he ions diffuse to higher energies are stopped below this energy .",
    "about @xmath12 of the particles can be accelerated to even higher energies and produce the observed high energy spectrum with some spectral features in this energy range .",
    "however , a more realistic model , including acceleration by other wave modes , is expected to produce smoother spectra .",
    "the above behaviors depend on six model parameters , which are shown in figure [ fig : times ] ( note that @xmath11 is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 via eq.[[alpha ] ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spec2 ] shows how the spectra change with two of these parameters : @xmath73 ( or the energy density of the turbulence ) and the injection temperature @xmath74 . because of the acceleration barrier at low energies , the acceleration of @xmath1he is very sensitive to @xmath74 . in the figure ,",
    "we adjust @xmath35 in order to make the fluence of @xmath1he and @xmath0he comparable at a few hundred kev per nucleon . as evident ,",
    "@xmath0he spectrum peaks at a higher energy with the increase of the intensity of the turbulence and the @xmath0he enrichment also changes significantly .",
    "this can explain the variation of the @xmath0he spectral peak and its enrichment in class 2 seps ( mason et al .",
    "2000 ; mason , mazur & dwyer 2002 ) .",
    "in the paper , we have shown that the observed @xmath0he and @xmath1he spectra in some impulsive seps can be produced via sa by pwt propagating parallel to magnetic field lines . in the model , the particles",
    "are injected from a thermal background . because the interaction of low energy @xmath1he is dominated by one of the resonant wave modes , an acceleration barrier forms , giving rise to a prominent quasi - thermal component in the steady state particle spectrum .",
    "this is not true for @xmath0he ions , however , which can be efficiently accelerated by two waves in the pc branch , from very low energies to @xmath5 mev nucleon@xmath3 , where they escape quickly from the acceleration site , producing a sharp spectral cutoff .",
    "this explains the @xmath0he enrichment and its varied spectrum seen in class 2 seps , which have relatively short rise - time and are more likely associated with the impulsive phase particle acceleration directly .",
    "class 1 events have less @xmath0he enrichment and similar spectra for most ions , indicating a different acceleration process ( mason et al .",
    "2000 ) . the feasibility of producing such events by shocks or turbulence with a different spectrum than that of the present model will be investigated in the future .    because the @xmath1he acceleration time is shorter than that of @xmath0he at higher energies and their loss and escape times are comparable",
    ", the model predicts a decrease of the @xmath0he to @xmath1he ratio with energy beyond @xmath4 mev nucleon@xmath3 , which is consistent with observations ( mason et al .",
    "2002 ; reames et al . 1997 ; mbius et al .",
    "1982 ; mbius et al . 1980 ; hsieh & simpson 1970 ) .",
    "spectral information at higher energies is critical in testing this model prediction .",
    "_ we emphasize here that a special injection mechanism is not required to explain the observations .",
    "_ however , a second - phase shock acceleration ( van hollebeke , mcdonald & meyer 1990 ) can modify the ion spectra and may explain events where the high energy spectral indices of @xmath0he and @xmath1he are similar ( serlemitsos & balasubrahmanyan 1975 ; reames et al . 1997 ) .    the model can also be applied to acceleration of heavy - ions . in this case , the acceleration is dominated by resonant interaction with waves in the hec branch and ions with low charge to mass ratio are accelerated more efficiently , which may explain the increase of ion enrichment with the increase of their charge to mass ratio ( mason et al .",
    "because @xmath0he acceleration is dominated by interaction with the pc branch , which may be decoupled from the hec branch , the model may also explain the lack of quantitative correlation of the enrichment of @xmath0he and heavy - ions ( mason et al .",
    "we will investigate these aspects in future work .",
    "the primary uncertainties of the model are associated with the turbulence generation mechanism and the subsequent cascade and dissipation processes .",
    "we start the investigation with a power law spectrum of the wavenumber for the turbulence , which can be characterized by the turbulence energy density and the spectral index .",
    "the acceleration of particles by obliquely propagating waves and turbulence with complex spectral shapes may give quantitatively different results .",
    "however , the idea of an efficient depletion of low energy @xmath0he from the source region to high energies to produce the observed enhancement seems well founded ."
