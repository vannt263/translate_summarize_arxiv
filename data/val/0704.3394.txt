    "high frequency ( hecto - hz ) quasi - periodic oscillations are observed in x  ray power spectra of a number of black hole x - ray binaries . in some sources they occur in pairs , with frequency ratios close to 3:2 ( see remillard & mcclintock 2006 for a recent review and lachowicz , czerny & abramowicz 2006 for similar analysis of active galactic nuclei data ) .",
    "this latter property of the high-@xmath0 qpo ( hfqpo hereafter ) has stimulated development of a class of models , which interpret the qpo as a result of non - linear resonances ( kluniak & abramowicz 2001 ) .",
    "since the qpo frequencies are close to dynamical frequencies very near the central black hole , the models involve fast dynamical processes , for example epicyclic motions . in particular , resonances between the radial and vertical epicyclic motions have been considered by abramowicz et al .",
    "another suggestion was made by blaes , arras & fragile ( 2006 ) , who proposed the `` breathing mode '' ( vertical pulsations ) of a radiation pressure accretion disc in resonance with vertical epicyclic motion .",
    "the resonance condition @xmath1 then selects the radius where the oscillations are concentrated , @xmath2 , and the observed modulation is produced .",
    "this radius has to be smaller than @xmath3 to match the values of frequencies actually observed in black hole binaries , indicating rotating black holes ( e.g. , trk et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the actual modulation of x - rays in the model of radial / vertical epicyclic motion resonances could be produced by variable relativistic effects , as the oscillating disk changes its position relative to un - perturbed position ( bursa et al .",
    "these effects obviously affect only spectral components emitted at the qpo radius .",
    "generally , x - ray emission from accreting black holes consists of two main spectral components : thermal emission from the accretion disc and a component produced by inverse compton up - scattering of a fraction of the disc photons in a hot plasma . in some sources a more complex spectra",
    "are also observed , e.g. , with the disc component and two comptonized components ( e.g. , gierliski & done 2003 and references therein ) . the reprocessed component ( iron fluorescent k@xmath4 line and the compton reflected continuum ) are often present as well .",
    "the quasi - periodic x - ray modulation may then appear in all or only some of the components .",
    "determining which components are actually modulated provides an important constraint on the model of the oscillations , since it constrains the physical process actually modulating the x - rays .",
    "for example , energy dependencies of a related qpo phenomenon , the low - frequency qpo ( @xmath5 hz ) in black hole binaries , reveal that it is the comptonized component that is modulated ( sobolewska & ycki 2006 ) . the disc component does not participate in the modulation .",
    "moreover , the qpo spectrum is harder than the time averaged spectrum ( at least in the soft spectral states ) , consistent with the qpo being driven by modulations of the heating rate of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "this has an important consequence in that any model postulating disc origin of the oscillations must provide a mechanism of transferring the oscillations to the hot comptonizing plasma without affecting the disc emission ( ycki & sobolewska 2005 ) .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to make a first step towards similar analysis of the hfqpo .",
    "first , we review the available data on energy dependencies of the hfqpo .",
    "we then simulate the dependencies for the specific hfqpo model of resonant epicyclic motions , with x - ray modulations solely due to varying relativistic effects .",
    "we consider two specific geometrical models . in the first model the standard accretion disc",
    "is envisioned to extend all the way to the last stable orbit and the hard x - rays are produced in a hot corona extending above the disc . as a consequence ,",
    "three spectral components are produced at the qpo radius : thermal disc emission , hard comptonized component and the reprocessed component .",
    "we will also extend this model to include an additional optically thick comptonized component emitted at the qpo radius .",
    "this is motivated by results of more careful analyses of spectra and energetics of very high state showing such additional component ( e.g. , done & kubota 2006 and references therein ) . in this scenario",
    "we assume that both the disc and the corona undergo epicyclic oscillations , so the relativistic effects affect all spectral components .    in the second model",
    ", the standard disc is truncated somewhere above @xmath2 and replaced by an inner hot flow .",
    "thus , only the hot plasma undergoes epicyclic oscillations , while the disc flux is not subject to those motions .",
    "only the comptonized component is thus produced at @xmath2 , and it is modulated by the relativistic effects .",
    "to date there are seven x - ray black hole binaries with power spectra that show high - frequency ( @xmath6 hz ) qpo .",
    "usually , these fast qpo are detected in the hard energy band and are less significant in the soft energy band ( e.g.  4u  1630 - 47 : klein - wolt , homan & van der klis 2004 ; grs  1915 + 105 : belloni et al .",
    "for instance , in xte  j1859 + 226 oscillations with frequencies of 150 and 187 hz were found in the 5.960 kev band , while in the 25.9 kev band neither of the qpo yielded a significant detection ( cui et al .",
    "2000 ) . in xte  j1650 - 500",
    "the 250 hz qpo is detected with rms amplitude of @xmath7 per cent , 4.5 per cent , and @xmath8 per cent in the 26.2 , 6.215.0 and 15.060.0 kev bands , respectively ( homan et al .",
    "2003 ) . in xte  j1550 - 564",
    "the 185 hz qpo is found with rms amplitude significantly higher in the 612 kev band than in the 26 kev band ( remillard et al .",

    "the 160 and 240 hz qpo have rms increasing from @xmath10 per cent ( @xmath111.2 per cent ) in the 3.35.8 kev band to 2.3 per cent ( 1.3 per cent ) in the 5.820.9 kev band for upper ( lower ) qpo and both qpo have rms amplitude @xmath1113 per cent in the 2160 kev band ( homan et al .  2005 ; see also remillard et al .",
    "the 67 hz qpo in grs  1915 + 105 has the rms amplitude increasing from 1.5 per cent below 5 kev to 6 per cent above 13 kev ( morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; cui 1999 ) . to illustrate the trends in energy we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : grshfqpo ] the high-@xmath0 power spectra of grs  1915 + 105 data analyzed in strohmayer ( 2001b ) .    there are however observations that contradict this general trend .",
    "for example , the slightly slower 65 hz qpo discovered in xte  j1550 - 564 shows very clear decrease of the rms amplitude with energy ( 5.5 per cent in the 26 kev band , 4.7 per cent in the 615 kev band , and @xmath12 per cent in the 1567 kev band ; kalemci et al .",
    "we note though that this qpo was discovered during a transition to the hard state , while the other hfqpo are typically seen in the very high state .",
    "another interesting example is that of gro  j1655 - 40 . while the 450 hz qpo shows the typical increase in the rms amplitude as mentioned above , the 300 hz qpo is seen _ only _ in the soft , 212 kev , band with typical rms amplitude of 0.8 per cent ( remillard et al .",
    "1999b ; strohmayer 2001a ) .",
    "this could mean that the 300 hz qpo has a different energy dependence and its rms decreases with energy .",
    "another possibility is that the rms is simply too low to be detectable in the hard band , where photon statistics is worse .",
    "this was pointed out by strohmayer ( 2001a ) who place the upper limit on the qpo rms amplitude in the 1324 kev band at 1.7 per cent .",
    "the interesting phenomenon of double hfqpo with integral frequency ratios of 2:3 or 3:5 was observed in a few sources .",
    "these include the 300 and 450 hz qpo in gro  j1655 - 40 ( remillard et al .  1999b , 2002 ; strohmayer 2001a ) , 160 and 240 hz qpo in h  1743 - 322 ( homan et al .",

    "1997 ; strohmayer 2001b ) .",
    "however , these pairs of qpo are not always detected simultaneously . moreover , due to limited statistics it is not always apparent whether this is a pair of qpo , or one qpo moving in frequency ( e.g.  miller et al .",
    "2001 ; homan et al .",
    "the best example here may be xte  j1550 - 564 for which the hfqpo were observed in a wide frequency range , 100285 hz ( e.g.  homan et al .",
    "however , remillard et al .  (",
    "2002 ) show that frequencies of these qpo cluster preferentially around 184 and 276 hz .",
    "we adopt the standard description of overall x - ray emission from x - ray binaries , that the thermal emission comes from an optically thick accretion disc , and the disc photons can be comptonized in a hot plasma forming the hard emission component .",
    "the hard x - rays can be further reprocessed in the accretion disc .",
    "our basic assumption is that there is no specific quasi - periodic modulation of the intrinsic emission , and the observed qpo is a result of relativistic effects ( although the intrinsic emission can be randomly variable producing the usual broad band power spectrum ) .",
    "we consider two geometrical scenarios : an accretion disc extending to the last stable orbit with a hot active corona above it , and an accretion disc replaced by a hot flow inside certain radius , somewhat larger than the qpo radius .",
    "emission from the optically thick accretion disc is described by the standard disc black body approximation with temperature varying with radius as , @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( assumed normalized to unity at its maximum ) describes the radiation flux due to gravitational energy dissipation , as a function of radius for a given angular momentum of the black hole ( see krolik 1999 , p.  150 ) .",
    "the comptonized component is computed using the thcomp code of zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is parameterized by the asymptotic slope of the spectrum , @xmath15 , plasma optical depth , @xmath16 , and seed photon temperature @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that hot plasma properties do not depend on the radius , and we adopt @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",

    "we assume @xmath40 .",
    "note that we assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 do not depend on the azimuthal angle , which means that the whole ring oscillates in phase .",
    "we construct the transfer function following a monte carlo method described in detail in ycki & niedwiecki ( 2005 ) , modified to implement the source motion corresponding to oscillations .",
    "a large number of photons are emitted from consecutive positions of the source , @xmath43 and @xmath44 given by equations ( [ equ : oscradial ] ) and ( [ equ : oscillation ] ) , with the phase of oscillations parametrized by @xmath45 .",

    "then , photon energy at infinity and constants of motion are given by [ see eqs .

    "obviously , the transfer function is periodic , with period @xmath81 .",
    "the oscillations were followed for a number of @xmath81 intervals , so that the qpo frequencies are better resolved in pds , and we have checked that the final qpo spectra do not depend on the number of @xmath81 intervals used .",
    "for the spectral computations presented we simulate the oscillations for total time @xmath83 .",
    "the time step in the simulations is equal to the time interval between the consecutive transfer functions , @xmath84 .",
    "the middle position of the ring is computed at each time point when a transfer function is known , @xmath85 ( modulo @xmath81 ) , and it is given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 according to equations ( [ equ : oscradial ] ) and ( [ equ : oscillation ] ) . for each @xmath85",
    "the energy spectrum of radiation emitted at @xmath2 is convolved with the transfer function producing a signal observed at infinity .",
    "the sequence of spectra created by the above procedure is subject to standard analysis in the time and fourier domains ( ycki 2003 and references therein ) . power spectra are computed in each energy channel .",
    "these consist of a number of narrow peaks , since the lightcurves are strictly periodic .",
    "we compute the rms variability ( normalized to the mean ) integrating each peak over frequency , in each energy channel .",
    "this , multiplied by the time average energy spectrum gives the qpo energy spectrum ( ycki & sobolewska 2005 ) .",
    "note , that because of arbitrary values of epicyclic motion amplitude and a schematic geometry , the rms amplitude of the model qpo does not have a physical meaning .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the shape of the qpo energy spectra .",
    "we note first that under the influence of relativistic effects the shape of a simple power law spectrum does not change . in the context of our models",
    "this means that a qpo energy spectrum would be the same as the input power law spectrum",
    ". however , x - ray spectra of x - ray binaries are not simple power laws .",
    "moreover , the modulation affects only a fraction of emission originating around the resonance radius , and we can also expect discrete spectral features ( the fe k@xmath4 line ) to be distorted by these effects .",
    "thus , the qpo spectrum can be expected to be different than the time average spectrum , giving a potential diagnostic of the qpo model .",
    "we first discuss the geometry of a disk extending to the marginally stable orbit , with the hard x - rays produced in a corona extending over a range of radii and x - ray reprocessing taking place locally .",
    "we assume that both the disc and the corona undergo epicyclic oscillations and , in consequence , the relativistic effects from the deformed precessing ring affect all three spectral components .",
    "thus , all three components can be expected to appear in the qpo spectrum .",
    "power spectrum from the light curve at 10 kev , for a maximally rotating black hole with @xmath37 and a high inclination of @xmath88 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] .",
    "it shows the two main qpo peaks , at @xmath89 , as well as many other ( sub)harmonics .",
    "relative height of the two main peak is not a robust prediction of the model , since it depends on the ( arbitrary ) oscillation amplitudes of the two epicyclic motions .",
    "we note that the other peaks are much weaker than the two main qpos , and therefore would be impossible to detect in current data .",
    "the qpo spectra for @xmath90 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffsp70]a , together with the time average spectra for comparison .",
    "the qpo spectra do indeed contain both the disc component and the fe line .",
    "the disc component in the strongest , @xmath91 , qpo is rather narrow and significantly blueshifted .",
    "the disc component in the weaker , @xmath92 , qpo is somewhat broader , and less strongly blueshifted . in the weak",
    "@xmath93 qpo the disk component is not really distinctly visible and the low energy cutoff is rather broad .",
    "the positions of the fe line give us a clue to the behaviour of the disc component .",
    "in all qpo spectra there is a line component around @xmath94 kev , which is the line energy blueshifted by the maximum blueshift , @xmath95 for the considered set of parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath2 and @xmath52 . in the @xmath92 and @xmath93 qpos",
    "there are also weak structures around @xmath97 kev , corresponding to the maximum redshift , @xmath98 .",
    "values of these extreme shifts vary as a result of disc precession , and this causes the observed disc emission to vary .",
    "it is the variable spectrum that appears as the qpo spectrum .",
    "the variability is strongest near the extreme energy shifts , and therefore discrete spectral features in the qpo spectra are mainly located at those extreme positions .",
    "differences between spectra at different @xmath0 result from different behaviour of the extreme energy shifts when folded ( observed ) at different sub - periods ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) of the total period , @xmath101 .",

    "corona geometry they show spectral features related to the variability of the fe line , as discussed above . in the hot flow geometry",
    "the qpo spectra show stronger cutoffs around 10 kev , clearly visible in the ratio representation .",
    "the strength of relativistic distortions depends on the inclination angle of the source , therefore we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffsp30 ] similar spectra for an inclination of @xmath105 and @xmath37 . for the lower @xmath52",
    "the range of redshift attained is narrower than for a higher @xmath52 , and @xmath106 , due to strong gravitational redshift . as a result ,",
    "the qpo spectra contain a distinct black body component ( it is less smeared than in the previous case ) , while the blue component of the fe line is at lower energy than it is in the time averaged spectra .",
    "the qpo spectra from the hot flow geometry are again featureless , and the low - energy cutoffs are somewhat sharper than in the high-@xmath52 case , due to narrower range of energy shifts .",
    "strength of the relativistic modulations depends also on the black hole spin .",
    "there is a dependence on @xmath96 for a given radius , and , in the context of our models , there is also a dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath96 .",
    "we have therefore computed the qpo spectra for a non - rotating black hole , @xmath39 , in the disc - corona geometry , for two values of the inclination angle .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffspa0 ] .",
    "these show strong disc component , as expected from the geometry , broadened and/or shifted according to the variations of the extreme energy shifts .",
    "models computed above demonstrate that the qpo spectrum is generally similar to the spectrum emitted at the qpo radius .",
    "this is reasonable , since the relativistic effects simply smear out the emitted spectrum .",
    "therefore , we also investigated a scenario , where the spectrum emitted at @xmath2 is rather different than spectra emitted at neighboring radii .",
    "this is also motivated by results of modeling of many high luminosity states spectra , which reveal additional components .",
    "for example , often a very high state spectrum contains a disc thermal component and _ two _ comptonized components , one of which is from relatively cool optically thick plasma .",
    "studies performed by , e.g. , done & kubota ( 2006 ) suggest that such a cool comptonized component may originate in inner part of accretion flow .",
    "we have therefore assumed that the spectrum produced at @xmath2 is a result of comptonization of disc photons in a plasma of @xmath107 kev and @xmath108 , while at other radii the parameters are as before . results , for @xmath37 and @xmath103 , are presented in fig .  [ fig : compt ] .",
    "the qpo spectra repeat the pattern observed also in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffsp70 ] for the same @xmath96 and @xmath52 , in the sense that the @xmath93 qpo spectrum is broadest , and the @xmath91 and @xmath92 spectra are blueshifted .",
    "we have computed qpo energy spectra from the model assuming that the x - ray modulation is produced by variable relativistic effects from oscillating accretion flow .",
    "the model was suggested for the high - frequency qpo observed in a number of black hole x - ray binaries , where pairs of qpo at frequencies with 3:2 ratio are often observed ( kluniak & abramowicz 2001 ) . in its basic form",
    "the model assumes that the intrinsic luminosity of the x - ray source is constant ( or at least there is no periodic component ) , and the entire observed modulation comes from the relativistic effects .",
    "this is currently the only model of high-@xmath0 qpo , which actually proposes a well defined mechanism of modulation of x - rays and thus can make predictions for spectral observables ( see also giannios & spruit 2004 for a model of low-@xmath0 qpo ) .",
    "observations of hfqpo are rather difficult , but current data suggest that the thermal disc emission does not participate in the modulations ( see review of observations in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] ) .",
    "it is however impossible to determine whether the qpo spectra are the same as the harder comptonization component or they are systematically harder or softer than this .",
    "the former case would mean that the qpo might correspond to a simple modulation of luminosity of the comptonization source , while the latter would imply either a dependence of spectral shape on radius , or spectral variability ( e.g. , ycki & sobolewska 2005 ) .",
    "the lack of modulation of the disc emission is , nevertheless , interesting since this appears to be a common property between the high-@xmath0 and low-@xmath0 qpo ( sobolewska & ycki 2006 ) .",
    "our computations show that the proposed x - ray modulation mechanism produces qpo spectra which are qualitatively similar to the spectrum of emission from the qpo radius .",
    "quantitatively , the qpo spectrum are broadened and shifted under the influence of the doppler and gravitational energy shifts .",
    "the amount of smearing depends on the extreme values of energy shifts , which themselves are functions of black hole spin ( both directly and through the qpo radius , given by the resonance condition ) , and the inclination angle .",
    "since the qpo energy spectra are really variability spectra , they depend also on the way @xmath98 and @xmath95 vary during the qpo cycle .",
    "this causes differences between spectra of different qpo .    in all our models where the disc thermal component is emitted at the qpo radius , it is variable and , obviously , it is present in the qpo spectrum .",
    "if , however , the lack of the disc component is indeed a robust feature of the hfqpo spectra , it suggests ( within the considered class of models ) that the optically thick accretion disc is absent in the region of qpo generation , and only hot plasma is present .",
    "this would support a geometry with an inner hot torus , perhaps consistent with recent mhd simulations ( e.g. , hawley & de villiers , 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "energy dependencies of the two main qpo in the considered model are generally very similar , apart from the small differences discussed above .",
    "this might be a test of the model , if it turned out that the observed dependencies are different .",
    "for example , the pair of hfqpo in gro  j1655 - 40 seem to have different energy dependencies : the 450 hz qpo has a hard spectrum ( rms increasing with @xmath109 ) , while the 300 hz seems to have a soft spectrum .",

    "<S> we model energy dependencies of the quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in the model of disc epicyclic motions , with x - ray modulation caused by varying relativistic effects . </S>",
    "<S> the model was proposed to explain the high frequency qpo observed in x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two specific scenarios for the geometry of accretion flow and spectral formation . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a standard cold accretion disc with an active x - ray emitting corona is assumed to oscillate . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , only a hot x - ray emitting accretion flow oscillates , while the cold disc is absent at the qpo radius . we find that the qpo spectra are generally similar to the spectrum of radiation emitted at the qpo radius , and they are broadened by the relativistic effects . in particular , the qpo spectrum contains the disc component in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we also review the available data on energy dependencies of high frequency qpo , and we point out that they appear to lack the disc component in their energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this would suggest the hot flow geometry in the spectral states when high frequency qpo are observed .    </S>",
