    "such an interaction can be considered analogous to hydrophobic or depletion interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ , entropy loss of water molecules surrounding hydrophobic molecules or polymers surrounding colloids @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these interactions , the membrane interactions are long - range ; the potential of the mean forces between the membranes and adhesion sites decays as @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "several groups have been investigated this entropic interaction theoretically @xcite and via simulations @xcite .",

    "the aim of this letter is to determine the condition required to form a large stable cluster only via this membrane - mediated entropic interaction and to clarify its difference from the typical phase separation generated by a pairwise interaction .",
    "we examine two conditions to intensify the attraction : ( 1 ) increasing entropy of the height fluctuations by binding more than two membranes and ( 2 ) increasing suppression effects on local height fluctuations surrounding the anchoring sites .",
    "we employ one of the solvent - free meshless membrane models @xcite to tackle this problem .",
