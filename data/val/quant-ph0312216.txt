    "communication of information requires an encoding of the information into a physical system . the laws of physics therefore govern the limits on processing and communication of information . by modelling real world noise in terms of simpler models , the maximum rate for information transfer",
    "may be obtained .",
    "the seminal work of shannon @xcite showed that a memoryless noisy channel , where the noise acts independently on each symbol sent through the channel , can be parameterized by a single quantity , the capacity of the channel @xmath0 .",
    "shannon defined the capacity as the maximum rate that information may be sent through a channel , and he also showed that there exist codes that asymptotically achieve this rate with a vanishing probability of error .",
    "the work of shannon has been extended to include channels with `` memory '' , where the noise is no longer independent of past channel uses @xcite , or where the channel consists of an arbitrary transformation of the input states @xcite .",
    "encoding classical information into quantum states of physical systems gives a physical implementation of the constructs of information theory .",
    "the majority of research into quantum communication channels has focused on the memoryless case , although there have been a number of important results obtained for quantum channels with correlated noise operators , or more general quantum channels @xcite .",
    "recently a model for quantum channels with memory has been proposed that can consistently define quantum channels with markovian correlated noise @xcite .",
    "the model also extends to describe channels that act on transmitted states in such a way that there is no requirement for interaction with an environment within the model .    in this paper a single upper bound on the capacity of arbitrary indecomposable quantum channels is derived .",
    "a quantum channel is defined as a completely positive , trace preserving map from the set of density operators to itself .",
    "any such map may be represented as a unitary operation between the system state and an environment with a known initial state @xcite .",
    "memoryless quantum channels act on each input state independently of the previous input or output states .",
    "for a single channel use the output state is given by , @xmath1\\ ] ] with @xmath2 the input state , @xmath3 the initial state of the environment , @xmath4 a unitary operation between the state @xmath5 and environment @xmath6 , and @xmath7 the output state . for a sequence of transmissions through a memoryless channel , the output state is given by , @xmath8 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\big(\\lambda_{n } \\otimes ... \\otimes \\lambda_{1 } \\big ) \\rho_q \\label{eqn : memoryless_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the state @xmath2 now represents a ( possibly entangled ) input state across the @xmath9 channel uses , the unitary operations @xmath10 are all identical , and the environment state is a product state @xmath11 .",
    "one model of a quantum memory channel is where each state going through the channel acts with a unitary interaction _ on the same channel memory state _ , as well as an independent environment .",
    "the backaction of the channel state on the message state therefore gives a memory to the channel .",
    "the general model thus includes a channel memory @xmath12 , and the independent environments for each qubit @xmath13 .",
    "hence , @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\mathrm{tr}_{m } \\big [ \\lambda_{n , m } ... \\lambda_{1,m }   \\big(\\rho_q \\otimes \\omega_m \\big ) \\big ] \\label{eqn : memory_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the initial memory state , @xmath2 and @xmath16 are the input and the output states of the channel , respectively , and the trace over the environment is over all environment states .",
    "figure [ fig : memory_channel ] illustrates the action of the unitary operators on the input , memory and environment states representing the channel .",
    "if the unitaries factor into independent unitaries acting on the memory and the combined state and environment , that is , @xmath17 , then the memory traces out and we have a memoryless channel .",
    "if the unitaries reduce to @xmath18 , we can call it a _ perfect _ memory channel , as no information is lost to the environment .",
    "the mapping of the memory state under the unitary operation also corresponds to a quantum channel on the memory state .",
    "memory channel representations where the action on the memory state is independent of the input state are termed _",
    "point _ memory channels , as the memory state will have a fixed point under the action of the represetation @xmath19\\omega_m = \\omega_m$ ] for all @xmath2 . fixed ",
    "point channels may also be seen to be symbol independent ( si ) , as the previous input states do not affect the action of the channel on the current input state .",
    "this is opposed to channels with intersymbol interference ( isi ) , where the previous input state affects the action of the channel on the current input .",
    "an extreme example of an isi channel is the quantum shift channel , where each input state is replaced by the previous input state .",
    "there exist examples of si channels that are not fixed point channels .",
    "the `` classical '' memory channel defined in terms of unitary kraus error operators by , @xmath20 for @xmath21 the transition probabilities of a markov chain , is not a fixed point channel , but displays no isi . in this case , however , the channel may equivalently be defined by , @xmath22 where the environment states @xmath23 are orthogonal .",
    "this results in a fixed  point channel with the equivalent output as obtained from ( [ eqn : markovmem ] ) .",
    "if the representations of a given memory channel are treated as an equivalence class under the input  output action of the channel , then for every channel of the above type , there exists a fixed  point representation of the channel . whether this is true for arbitrary isi channels is not known",
    ". we may also conjecture that the types of memory channels that display _ only _ isi may be represented as perfect memory channels .     and",

    "the fano inequality , combined with the holevo upper bound on the accessible information , provides an entropic upper bound on the classical information capacity of any quantum channel . utilizing classical  quantum states of the form , @xmath26 where the @xmath27 form an orthonormal set .",
    "it is possible to derive the holevo bound from the von neumann mutual information bound over these classical  quantum states . to view the upper bound in",
    "a more physically motivated setting we can note that any separable state @xmath28 can be extended , in a larger hilbert space , to a state @xmath29 in the form of ( [ eqn : class_quant1 ] ) . to show this note that any separable state may be written in the form , @xmath30 and each @xmath31 may be purified into a direct sum of hilbert spaces @xmath32 with orthogonal support , such that , @xmath33 where @xmath34 = \\rho^j_r$ ] . due to the monotonicity of the von neumann mutual information @xmath35",
    ", the upper bound may be expressed as , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the set of all separable states .",
    "the maximum amount of mutual information that may be generated through a quantum channel @xmath38 is therefore bounded by the maximum amount of `` classical '' correlation that may be shared by states through the channel .",

    "this bound has been shown to be attainable whenever the channel is described by ( [ eqn : markovmem2 ] ) with unitary kraus operators @xmath41 , and the initial error probabilities are equal to the steady state probabilities for the regular markov chain @xcite .",
    "an indecomposable channel is one where the long - term behavior of the channel is independent of the initial channel state .",
    "memory channels with markov correlated noise are an example of indecomposable channels .",
    "we begin by defining the _ trace distance _ of both probability distributions and density operators . for probability distributions",
    "the trace distance is defined as @xmath42 , for distributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where both distributions share the index set @xmath45 @xcite . for density operators",
    "the trace distance is defined as @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , taking the positive square root .",

    "the long term behavior of an indecomposable channel is therefore independent of the initial memory state . fixed point channels for which the map on the memory state is a strictly contractive mapping @xmath56 , are automatically indecomposable .",
    "the behavior of the memory state is of fundamental importance due to the fact that memory channels that may be represented in the form of ( [ eqn : memory_model ] ) are _ memory continuous_. a channel is memory continuous if for any @xmath49 there exist a @xmath57 , such that , @xmath58\\rho_q - \\lambda[\\sigma_m]\\rho_q\\| \\leq \\epsilon .",

    "hence , for @xmath60 the partial trace operation @xmath61 .",
