    "when subjected to high perpendicular magnetic fields , two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) exhibit a wide variety of exotic phenomena including the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) .",
    "@xcite the composite fermion ( cf ) theory @xcite explains the fqhe of electrons by mapping it to the integer qhe of cfs which are electron - magnetic flux quasi - particles . although absent in the simplest version of the cf theory , the presence of discrete degrees of freedom , such as spin and valley , ushers in a rich variety of phenomena . for many years ,",
    "understanding the spin polarization of the various fqhe states has been a topic of great interest among experimentalists and theorists alike . in the case of exotic states such as the one formed at landau level filling factor @xmath1 ,",
    "the determination of spin - polarization is valuable for deducing the nature of the ground state as its possible non - abelian statistics has promising consequences for topological quantum computing .",
    "@xcite for other states , e.g. those which form around @xmath2 1/2 and 3/2 , numerous transport , @xcite optical , @xcite and nuclear spin resonance and relaxation @xcite studies have aided the understanding of the role of spin in the cf picture .",
    "@xcite    it was recently shown @xcite that cfs which form at @xmath3 in alas quantum wells possess a valley degree of freedom which in principle is analogous to spin . in this study",
    ", we use in - plane strain to tune the energy of the occupied valleys , and measure the valley splitting energy needed to completely valley polarize the cfs at and around @xmath0 .",
    "we find remarkably good agreement between our results and the existing theory which was developed to explain the spin - polarization of cfs in ( single - valley ) gaas .",
    "@xcite however , the polarization energy , normalized to the coulomb energy , is found to depend on the 2d electron density ( @xmath4 ) , a feature not explained by the cf theory .",
    "we report measurements on two samples ( a and b ) which are 12 and 15 nm - wide alas quantum wells grown using molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "details of sample growth are given in ref .",
    "a standard hall bar is fabricated using photolithography , geauni alloy is used as contact , and metallic front and back gates are deposited on the sample which allow us to control @xmath4 .",
    "studies were done both in a @xmath5he cryostat and a dilution refrigerator at base temperatures of about 0.3 k and @xmath6 mk , respectively and using standard low - frequency lock - in techniques .",
    "the band structure of bulk alas has three ellipsoidal conduction band minima ( valleys ) at the x - points of the brillouin zone . in quantum wells wider than 5 nm , only two valleys with their major axes lying in the 2d plane are occupied .",
    "@xcite their in - plane fermi contours are anisotropic and are characterized by transverse and longitudinal band effective masses , _ m@xmath7 _ = 0.205__m@xmath8 _ _ and _ m@xmath9 _ = 1.05__m@xmath8 _ _ , where _ m@xmath8 _ is the free electron mass .",
    "the degeneracy between these two valleys can be broken by the application of strain which we accomplish by gluing the sample to a piezoelectric stack ( piezo ) , as shown in fig .",
    "a voltage @xmath10 applied to the piezo induces a strain @xmath11}-\\epsilon_{[010]}$ ] where @xmath12}$ ] and @xmath13}$ ] denote strains along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] crystal directions respectively .",
    "@xcite this strain causes a transfer of electrons from one valley to another .",
    "the resulting valley splitting energy is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the deformation potential which in alas has a band value of 5.8 ev .",
    "@xcite although the above picture of valley occupation was first chalked out for the case of electrons , @xcite a similar approach for cfs was recently demonstrated .",
    "@xcite      for the density range under study , the band parameters for alas electrons are such that the zeeman energy is larger than the cyclotron energy . since there are two valleys available for occupation near @xmath16 , the first two electron landau levels ( lls ) have the same spin .",
    "since the cfs near @xmath0 form in the second electron ll , this cf system is effectively single - spin and two - valley .",
    "this is in contrast to the energy level diagram for gaas electrons which involves only one valley ; however the band parameters in the gaas system are such that the zeeman energy is small and the second electron ll is of the opposite spin .",
    "thus , in gaas , the cfs formed around @xmath0 form a single - valley , two - spin system . in either case",
    ", the cf sea at @xmath0 is formed by hole - flux composite particles .",
    "@xcite these cfs no longer feel the externally applied perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath17 .",
    "instead , they feel an effective magnetic field given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the field at @xmath0 .",
    "the various fqhe states formed around @xmath0 are taken to be the integer qhe states of these cfs .",
    "each fractional electron filling factor ( @xmath20 ) has an integer cf counterpart ( @xmath21 ) . @xcite",
    "in fig . 1(c ) we show magnetoresistance traces for sample a taken at different values of @xmath22 . at @xmath16 , the fqhe minima at @xmath23 and 7/5 are very weak or absent while the minimum at @xmath24 is strong . as we move away from @xmath16",
    "various minima become weak and strong as a function of @xmath22 . for example , the traces shown in purple ( @xmath16 ) and blue ( @xmath25 ) show the weakest minima for @xmath26 while those in red ( @xmath27 ) exhibit the weakest minima for @xmath24 .",
    "this behavior can be qualitatively understood by following the simple cf energy fan diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . at @xmath16",
    "each of the cf lls is doubly ( valley ) degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is broken as we apply strain and the two valleys separate in energy .",
    "there are specific values of @xmath22 at which the lls of cfs undergo an energetic `` coincidence '' thereby causing the gap at the fermi energy ( @xmath28 ) to vanish . for example , the @xmath26 state ( _ p _ = 3 ) is weak at @xmath16 and undergoes one coincidence as @xmath22 increases before becoming completely valley polarized at large @xmath22 . in transport measurements ,",
    "these coincidences show up as the weakening of the fqhe minima . at high enough strains",
    "all the states become fully valley polarized .",
    "note here that as we apply strain , both the electron and cf lls split in energy .",
    "it is important to realize that in the range of @xmath22 depicted in fig .",
    "1 , it is the cfs that become valley polarized ; much larger values of @xmath22 are needed to valley polarize the @xmath29 lls .",
    "@xcite this two - valley nature of the electron lls is critical for justifying the description of the cfs as being formed in a `` two - valley , single - spin '' system .     to [ 010 ] valley in response to strain is also shown .",
    "( b ) simple energy fan diagram in the cf model for a two - valley , single - spin system .",
    "the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] valleys are degenerate in energy at @xmath16 and the degeneracy is lifted as strain is applied .",
    "( c ) magnetoresistance traces taken at @xmath30 = 300mk , at different values of strain ( shown on the right in units of @xmath31 ) for @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the traces are offset vertically for clarity . ]",
    "note that the data in fig .",
    "1(c ) were taken at @xmath30 = 300 mk .",
    "we repeated these measurements at @xmath35 mk in a second cooldown in a different cryostat and the results are shown in fig .",
    "the behavior is qualitatively the same , but we note that resistance minima at some higher order fractions , for example @xmath36 and 10/7 are better developed .    to demonstrate the response of the various minima to @xmath22 , we hold @xmath17 fixed at a particular @xmath20 and sweep @xmath22 . in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , we show results for sample a at @xmath30 = 300 mk and 50 mk respectively .",
    "the peak positions are observed to be temperature independent .",
    "note the symmetry between the positive and negative values of @xmath22 .",
    "this is because the current in this sample is flowing along the [ 110 ] crystal direction with respect to which the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] valleys are symmetric . in each trace of fig .",
    "3 the phase and number of oscillations are consistent with the fan diagram in fig .",
    "the high quality of this sample is evident from the appearance of higher order fractions ( up to @xmath37 ) .",
    "the oscillations at the higher order fractions are particularly interesting since the field sweeps show only weak evidence of their existence .",
    "similar measurements in sample b are shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) .",
    "our piezorsistance data allow us to determine the onset of cf valley polarization at exactly @xmath0 also .",
    "notice the piezoresistance trace taken at @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4(a ) ; for comparison , we also show a trace at @xmath17 = 0 in fig .",
    "the @xmath17 = 0 trace can be explained qualitatively in a simple model where the conductivities of the two anisotropic valleys add in parallel , leading to an increase in the resistance as the electrons are transferred from one valley to the other .",
    "the piezoresistance can also stem from a loss of screening as the electrons become valley polarized and lose their valley degree of freedom ; this is analogous to the @xmath39 exhibited by 2dess as the electrons become @xmath40 polarized in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "@xcite the `` kink '' in the piezoresistance and the near - saturation of the resistance at sufficiently large @xmath22 signal the full valley polarization of the electrons , @xcite again , in analogy with the magnetoresistance data .",
    "@xcite now , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , we observe a qualitatively similar behavior at @xmath41 .",
    "the resistance at @xmath0 exhibits a minimum when the two valleys are balanced , increases as the valley degeneracy is broken and saturates once the cfs are fully valley polarized .",
    "we take the kink position , marked by an arrow in fig .",
    "4(a ) , to signal the complete valley polarization of the cfs .",
    "@xcite we note that very recent experimental data @xcite for gaas cfs at @xmath42 also show an enhancement , followed by a near - saturation , of the resistance as the cfs become @xmath40 polarized .    the energy needed to completely valley",
    "polarize the cfs , @xmath43 , can be obtained directly from figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "for @xmath44 , 3 and 4 , complete polarization is signalled by the outer - most peaks in piezoresistances as these occur at the last coincidence ( see e.g. , the red square and blue circle in fig.1(b ) ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath0 , the kink position in the piezoresistance trace is taken as the point of full valley polarization ( shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) with an arrow ) with the upper and lower excursions included in the error bars . in all cases , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the measured threshold strain and @xmath15 = 5.8 ev .      .",
    "data are shown for both samples at comparable @xmath4 .",
    "theoretical phase boundaries ( originally worked out for two - spin system ) based on the microscopic cf theory ( black circles ) and @xmath48 model ( solid line ) from ref .",
    "18 are also shown . ]    in fig .",
    "5 we plot @xmath43 for various @xmath20 in units of the coulomb energy @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dielectric constant of alas and @xmath51 is the magnetic length .",
    "data from both samples ( obtained from figs",
    ". 3(b ) and 4(a ) ) are shown at comparable values of @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite also shown are small black circles ( joined with a dotted line ) , taken from ref . 18 which is the theoretical calculation @xcite using a microscopic cf - wavefunction .",
    "note that the theoretical phase boundary is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this is not surprising since the cf - hamiltonian comprises entirely of the coulomb interaction term .",
    "hence all relevant energy scales in the problem should scale as @xmath52 .",
    "since the calculations are not done for negative values of @xmath21 , we compare our experimental data points to a simpler , one - parameter model which is obtained in ref .",
    "18 as follows .",
    "the points obtained from the microscopic cf theory for positive @xmath21 are extrapolated to @xmath53 ( 1/@xmath21 = 0 ) to obtain an intercept of @xmath54 .",
    "since this value corresponds to the complete polarization of the cf sea at @xmath0 , we have @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 in units of @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite @xmath48 is defined to be the _ polarization mass _ of the cfs .",
    "@xcite for a given @xmath21 , the condition of complete polarization can be written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the valley splitting of the cfs and @xmath60 is the cf cyclotron energy . using @xmath61 and the fact that @xmath62 , the phase boundary can be obtained in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath48 .",
    "the final result , @xmath63 , is shown as two solid curves separating the partially- and fully - polarized cfs .",
    "although there is no inherent mass in the cf hamiltonian , this simple one - parameter model is found to be valuable in interpreting experimental data .",
    "@xcite    there is overall good agreement between the experimental data points and the theoretical phase boundary , given that there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "not only are the values very close to each other , but also the asymmetry of the phase boundary about @xmath64 is reflected in the data .",
    "for example , @xmath65 and 8/5 both correspond to @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath43 , however , are theoretically expected to be different .",
    "consistent with this , our data shows that @xmath43 for @xmath67 is always larger than the value for @xmath24 .",
    "however , this agreement might be fortuitous . first , both the experiment and the theory have errors .",
    "some causes of error in the theoretical calculations for the ideal 2d system are examined in ref .",
    "our experiment carries an overall uncertainty in the @xmath68-axis of up to 10@xmath69 arising from our strain calibration .",
    "second , and more importantly , the experimental phase boundary for the full valley polarization of cfs depends on @xmath4 , in contrast to the theoretical expectation .    to bring out the @xmath4-dependence of the phase boundary",
    ", we repeated similar measurements for a range of @xmath4 in both samples and the results are summarized in fig . 6 . the data for sample a were taken at 300 mk ( during the first cooldown ) and data for sample b at 50 mk .",
    "the theoretical predictions based on the single @xmath48 model are also shown as dotted lines .",
    "our experimental results show that there is a small , but measurable variation of the normalized polarization energy as a function of @xmath4 . here",
    "we emphasize that , for a given sample , the trend observed as a function of @xmath4 is unaffected by the @xmath70 error in our strain gauge calibration .     for samples a and b.",
    "the dotted horizontal lines are theoretical predictions based on the @xmath48 model for the various @xmath20 as indicated .",
    "when not shown , error bars are comparable to the symbol size . ]    the density dependence that emerges from our data demands a better theoretical understanding . note",
    "that residual interactions between cfs can not be blamed for the trend we observe .",
    "this is clear from the @xmath4-independent nature of the phase boundary obtained from the microscopic cf theory , which in principle includes effects of interaction .",
    "@xcite however , ref .",
    "18 deals with an ideal 2d electron system with no thickness , ll mixing or disorder . in ref .",
    "19 , an attempt was made to address the role of finite layer thickness .",
    "a simple way is to replace the bare coulomb potential @xmath71 with an effective potential @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the characteristic thickness of the electron wavefunction . in our samples ,",
    "where electrons are confined to square quantum wells , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath73 is constant or that it slightly increases with increasing density . either way , theory expects the value of @xmath74 to decrease as a function of increasing @xmath4 , opposite to the trend observed in our experiments .",
