    "the directed percolation ( dp ) has been studied extensively as one of typical dynamic critical phenomenon far from equilibrium @xcite .",

    "even systems with infinitely many ( i m ) absorbing states such as the pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite are believed to share the same critical behavior with the dp , but the theoretical understanding of the im - type dp ( dp@xmath2 ) models is still lacking .",
    "for example , the phenomenological field theory introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite shows inconsistency with the numerical studies .",
    "in fact , the field theory based on the phenomenological langevin equation predicts that the pcp should belong to the dynamic percolation rather than the dp class @xcite . besides the universality issue ,",
    "its spreading dynamics is also not fully understood @xcite .",
    "one may reduce the number of absorbing states significantly by introducing particle diffusion ( pcp with diffusion or pcpd ) @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the pcpd has brought up serious turmoil , which could not be settled down in spite of extensive numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite studies .",
    "the answer seems to be one of two possibilities : the pcpd belongs to the dp class with a long transient , or forms a new universality class distinct from known universality classes to date . as an attempt to resolve the issue , the present authors suggested two different approaches to the pcpd .",
    "first , introducing the dynamic perturbation which is implemented by the biased hopping , we showed that the one - dimensional pcpd with biased diffusion ( driven pcpd or dpcpd ) , exhibits critical scaling distinct from the unbiased pcpd , but instead shares the critical behavior with the two - dimensional pcpd without bias ( dimensional reduction ) @xcite .",
    "since all known dp models are robust against the biased diffusion @xcite , a dpcpd - type variant can serve as a litmus test for the pcpd scaling @xcite .",
    "second , we studied the crossover behavior from the pcpd to the dp by introducing single - particle annihilation / branching reactions and showed that there are diverging crossover scales with the universal nontrivial crossover exponent @xcite .",
    "these results provided another evidence that the pcpd is distinct from the dp .    in this paper",
    ", we study the crossover behavior from the dp@xmath2 to the dp in order to understand better the difference between these two `` equivalent '' ( dp ) universality classes .",
    "actually , it would be absurd to talk about the crossover between two models belonging to the identical universality class ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : single_to_single ] ) .",
    "however , the dp@xmath2 models differ from the dp models in regard to the `` non - order '' parameter at the transitions , which shows a discontinuous singularity at the crossover .",
    "this singularity induces a well - defined and nontrivial crossover from the dp@xmath2 to the dp , more generally a crossover arising from a considerable reduction of the number of absorbing states ( between two different dp@xmath2 ) .",
    "we find two distinct crossover behaviors depending on the routes to reduce the number of absorbing states .",
    "infinitesimal inclusion of an `` excitatory '' process ( like single - particle branching ) makes the system overly active , which gives rise to a discontinuous crossover ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dpima ] ) . while , the opposite `` inhibitory '' route ( like single - particle annihilation ) reveals a continuous crossover with the nontrivial crossover exponent @xmath3 .",
    "we find that this crossover exponent is universal for various kinds of models including the pcp and the triplet contact process ( tcp ) .",
    "we argue that the crossover exponent is not independent but equal to @xmath1 , the relaxation time exponent of the dp universality class on a general footing .",
    "this conjecture is also confirmed in the case of the directed ising ( parity - conserving ) class ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the pcpd _ per se _ can be considered one of crossover models from the dp@xmath2 by allowing diffusion , which reduces the number of absorbing states considerably ( from exponentially many to linearly many absorbing states with respect to system size ) .",
    "however , the crossover study from the pcp to the pcpd does not give any useful information on the dp@xmath2 , because the particle diffusion makes the system more active ( excitatory ) and the crossover turns out to be discontinuous .",
    "finally , we study the crossover from the diffusive reaction models to the dp .",
    "such an example is the crossover from the pcpd to the dp studied in ref .  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dptodp ] , the hybrid - type models with diffusion ( tp12 : @xmath4 ) @xcite are perturbed by adding a single - particle annihilation process ( @xmath5 ) and its crossover to the dp is investigated .",
    "these hybrid - type models ( where the branching process is of higher order than the annihilation process ) are numerically known to belong to the dp class .",
    "as expected , the critical line emanates `` linearly '' from the hybrid - type model point .",
    "we suggest an argument why these models should belong to the dp rather than a pcpd - type nontrivial class .",
    "this section considers a @xmath6-dimensional stochastic system of hard core particles with dynamics summarized in table  [ table : dp ] . in ref .",

    "is meant that all correlation functions of the model with tilded parameters can be deduced from those of the model with untilded parameters and vice versa .",

    "@xmath22 processes are allowed with @xmath15 particle diffusion .",
    "since @xmath16 particles are not allowed to hop , the system is inactive without an @xmath15 particle but only with @xmath16 particles .",
    "the number of the absorbing states grows exponentially with system size and the auxiliary field ( @xmath16 particle ) density is finite at the absorbing transition . besides",
    ", the number of @xmath15 particles is conserved modulo 2 , which is the characteristic of the di ( or parity - conserving ) class .    as in sec .",

    "we locate the critical line by exploiting the known di critical exponents @xcite , which is summarized in table  [ table : di_pc ] for some @xmath23 s .",
    "since the critical exponent @xmath1 of the di class ( @xmath26 ) is much larger than that of the dp ( @xmath27 ) , the accuracy of the critical points in table  [ table : di_pc ] is worse than that for the dp cases . from these data",
    ", one can estimate the crossover exponent @xmath28 as @xmath29 which should be compared with @xmath30 of the di class ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "hence we conclude that our argument for @xmath32 also applies to the crossover from the im - type di to the di models .",

    "the crossover from the pcpd to the dp caused by including single - particle reactions has been studied previously by the present authors @xcite where the value of the crossover exponent is reported as @xmath33 .",
    "this value is quite close to that obtained for the crossover from the dp@xmath2 to the dp in sec .",
    "[ sec : dpima ] .",
    "this similarity may mislead one to jump to the wrong conclusion that the critical nature of the pcp and the pcpd is equivalent .",
    "however , one should remember that the origin of the nontrivial crossover from the pcp to the dp lies in the finiteness of the auxiliary field density at the pcp critical point , while it vanishes at the pcpd critical point .",
    "so , if the pcpd belongs to the dp class , then one should expect a trivial crossover with @xmath34 .",
    "our finding of the nontrivial crossover in @xcite implies that the pcpd class is distinct from the dp class .",
