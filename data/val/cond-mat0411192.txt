    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have become a paradigm in the physics of low - dimensional systems due to their fascinating properties  @xcite . especially , the close interconnection between their chirality and their electronic structure make them an ideal candidate for applications in the field of molecular electronics . as a consequence ,",
    "extensive experimental and theoretical research has been carried out in the past years to clarify their structural and conducting properties  @xcite .    concerning quantum transport in cnts ,",
    "it is theoretically well - established that the linear conductance is quantized in units of @xmath0  @xcite . in the case of metallic tubes , effective low - energy theories as well as tight - binding and _ ab initio _ calculations",
    "have demonstrated that two massless electronic bands with linear dispersion cross the fermi points at @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the cnt lattice constant  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "two transport channels per spin are open at the fermi level @xmath3 , leading to a conductance of 4@xmath4 .",
    "this value is conserved even in the presence of disorder as far as the range of the impurity potential is larger than the nanotube lattice constant  @xcite .",
    "the same is expected to hold in the presence of vibrations at low but nonzero temperatures , where only long wavelength modes can be excited  @xcite .",
    "this is however not transferable to high temperatures , where additional modes may be activated , or to higher - lying bands , where mixing can lead to additional backscattering .",
    "so far , the interaction of electrons with phonon modes in cnts has been mainly addressed in periodic systems  @xcite .",
    "it is rather difficult to clarify the interplay between charge transport and coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom in its full generality .",
    "this requires a reliable electronic structure method , the calculation of electron - phonon matrix elements and the combination with a transport formalism .",
    "some developments in this direction have recently been presented  @xcite , though the calculations were limited to small molecular systems . in nanotubes , however , the large number of vibrational modes make these approaches computationally very demanding .    here , we investigate the influence of structural fluctuations on the _ elastic _ electron transport in single - wall cnts .",
    "we apply a recently proposed computational scheme @xcite to shed some light on the influence of vibrational modes on charge propagation in cnts .",
    "the method combines green function techniques with a density - functional - based ( df ) methodology for the electronic properties of the system .",
    "electron - phonon matrix elements are not directly calculated ; the effect of the lattice distortions on charge propagation is considered via suitable configurational averaging procedures .",
    "anticipating our main results , we find that the global effect of thermal fluctuations turns out to be stronger for massive bands than for massless bands ,  the transmission around the fermi energy is not appreciably affected by them on the length scales investigated here .",
    "further , we show that the effect of the atomic vibrations on the electron transport can be qualitatively captured by static disorder in the spirit of the anderson model  @xcite .",
    "the system consists of an infinite metallic ( 4,4 ) cnt , where a finite section is allowed to vibrate and thus define the _ scattering region _ , see fig .",
    "the remaining semiinfinite segments of the nanotube constitute the electrodes .",
    "this configuration approximately mimics the experimental situation of clamped cnts @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this geometry is the possibility of comparing the conductance in presence of thermal fluctuations with the limiting case of a perfect infinite tube , where conductance quantization is obtained .",
    "calculations for semiconducting tubes were also performed @xcite and showed that the gap region is not appreciably affected by vibrations , while outside the gap a behavior quite similar to that presented here is obtained . because of the large number of atoms required to simulate the electrodes , the interface and the vibrating region ( scattering region ) , only short sections of the nanotube were included in the latter ( three unit cells ) .",
    "numerical tests with up to six unit cells have not shown any new qualitative effects when comparing with the present calculations . with increasing number of cells",
    "the phonon spectrum will develop features of the infinite system ,  emergence of precursors of low - frequency acoustic and optical modes .",
    "obviously , our approach can not well describe these long - wave length modes ; the main effects we find here are however related to vibrations with energies larger than @xmath5 mev ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "note , however , that upon this initial suppression these bands are not very sensitive to further temperature variations .",
    "the reason is that the main contribution to the conductance arises from modes with energies larger than @xmath32 mev ( @xmath33 ) , whose thermal occupation factors are much less than one for the temperature range discussed here ( see below ) . at the crossover points , where new bands start contributing to transport ,  at energies  @xmath34v , @xmath35v , and @xmath36v ,",

    "though the basic features found in the fpa are also seen here , there is however a less abrupt suppression of the conductance of the massive bands with increasing temperature .",

    "even at @xmath39 , @xmath40 is much closer to the zero temperature case , in contrast to the fpa .",
    "this is related to the zero - point fluctuations ( zpf ) , which are included in the quantum mechanical fp calculation , but are absent in the classical md approach .",
    "the zero - point energy ( @xmath41 ) is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass , so that we may expect that the impact of zpf on the conductance for a light atom like carbon will be rather strong .",
    "nonetheless , the similarity of the results for the fp and md approaches indicates that the harmonic approximation is reliable when dealing with the vibrational spectrum of cnts .    in our calculations",
    ", an electron propagating along the vibrating part of the tube will basically feel a quasi - random field .",

    "one clearly sees that the two basic signatures of structural fluctuations previously found , namely ( i ) conductance dips at the band crossover points and ( ii ) conductance suppression on the massive bands , are qualitatively reproduced within the anderson model .",
    "the influence of disorder on the conductance is , as expected , dependent on the cnt lenght .",
    "this is clearly seen at the charge neutrality point , where @xmath55 is much stronger suppressed for longer tubes . from these results , we may expect a relation between @xmath56 and the strength of thermal fluctuations , gauged by @xmath57 .",
    "this will lead to a @xmath58-dependent disorder parameter @xmath59 .",
    "however , the differences in the basis sets used in the fpa / md approaches ( non - orthogonal @xmath60 basis ) and in the anderson model ( @xmath42 orbitals ) , respectively , makes a straightforward mapping very difficult .",
    "we may get some insight by estimating the temperature dependence of the @xmath61 matrix elements in our df - based method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 integrals basically describe the interaction of the @xmath62 orbitals and can be thus related to the empirical @xmath42-orbital models .",
    "we expand them to linear order in the atomic displacements around the equilibrium c@xmath63c bond , @xmath64 , for each atom @xmath65 in the scattering region : @xmath66 . from the monte - carlo sampling outlined above  @xcite , it is possible to compute an average mean - square fluctuation of the atomic distortions @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an average over the @xmath69 distribution ( see above ) and a further average over all atoms in the scattering region has been carried out .",
    "the related t - dependent fluctuations @xmath70 , give a measure of the degree of bond disorder introduced by the thermal motion and are thus related to the anderson parameter @xmath71 , see the right panel of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "next , we address in more detail the influence of zpf on the conductance . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the averaged conductance for a fixed temperature with and without zpf . we clearly see that zpf do not have a sensitive influence on the behavior around the fermi energy , i.  e.  on the lowest conductance plateau .",
    "however , the neglect of zpf appreciably weakens the conductance suppression on the massive bands .    an important advantage of the fpa is the possibility to isolate the influence of _ individual _ vibrational modes on the electronic transport at a given temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the conductance @xmath72 when _ only _ one eigenmode at the time is included in the transport calculation . in the figure , the @xmath73-axis labels both , the mode number @xmath52 and its energy .",
    "results are shown for two different electronic energies , indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . a general feature we can clearly see ,",
    "is that electrons at the fermi energy do not `` see '' the vibrational field ,  only few modes give a contribution to the conductance ; moreover , the induced conductance change is much smaller than one percent .",
    "this illuminates farther our previous observation that near @xmath74 the structure of the electronic spectrum is not appreciably changed when compared with the zero temperature case .",
    "the other energy showed corresponds to a high - conductance plateau around @xmath75v . on the latter , almost all vibrational modes are contributing .",
    "the reason is that enhanced backscattering related to channel mixing is more effective for massive bands and so the phase space available for scattering becomes larger .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( right panel ) , the neglection of zpf reduces the contribution of the higher - lying modes , which are mainly c - c stretching bonds with different spatial patterns .",
    "the reason is that at the temperatures considered here ( up to @xmath37 k ) the thermal occupation of these modes is basically negligible . as a result ,",
    "the main contribution to the mode energy arises from the zpf terms @xmath41 . why the global conductance suppression _ without _ zpf becomes much weaker ,",
    "can be easely understood by looking at the typical length scales of the problem .",
    "the wave length of a tunneling electron is of the order of @xmath76 , which is approximately of the same order as the length of the scattering region @xmath77 .",
    "low - frequency modes have wave lengths larger than @xmath78 , the opposite holding for high - energy modes . hence ,",
    "if the latter are inactive ( no zpf and negligible thermal factors ) , a propagating charge will mainly `` see '' long - wavelength distortions , which are less effective in scattering electrons .",
    "we have investigated signatures of structural distortions in the conductance spectrum of a metallic cnt .",
    "we found that the average effect of the lattice fluctuations may be qualitatively described by anderson disorder .",
    "our results point out that the linear bands crossing the degenerate fermi points are not appreciably affected by structural fluctuations within the temperature range and length scales considered here . as a result",
