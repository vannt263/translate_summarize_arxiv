    "the boson fermion ( bf ) model describes a mixture of the narrow band fermions coupled to a system of the composite hard - core bosons .",
    "initially , this type of an effective hamiltonian has been invented for a system of itinerant electrons interacting with the local lattice deformations in the crossover regime , between adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits @xcite .",
    "later , the same model has been independently considered by a number of authors @xcite as a possible scenario for a mechanism of the high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) .",
    "there are also attempts to apply a similar bf model to explain certain aspects of the bose condensed atoms of the alkali metals @xcite .",
    "this model reveals a rich physics both in its : normal phase and the broken symmetry superconducting / superfluid state . as shown in the mean field type studies @xcite",
    "there is a characteristic temperature @xmath2 bellow which fermions are driven to the superconducting phase and simultaneously bosons start to bose - condense .",
    "this result has been confirmed ( neglecting the hardcore nature of bosons ) by means of the shielded potential approximation @xcite and with a help of the renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , when approaching the critical temperature from above , the pairing - wise correlations start to manifest themselves strongly . in particular , they may give rise to a formation of the pseudogap in the fermion spectrum . this effect , known experimentally from a variety of measurements",
    "( see e.g.  review paper @xcite ) , provides a firm argument for application of this model to describe the htsc materials .",
    "pseudogap formation and its variation with a lowering temperature has been carefully investigated for the bf model using : a ) the selfconsistent perturbative treatment of the boson - fermion coupling @xcite , b ) the perturbative treatment of the kinetic processes ( a l hubbard i for the fermion hopping ) with respect to the exact solution of this model in its atomic limit @xcite , c ) the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) equations which have been selfconsistently solved within the noncrossing approximation for the auxiliary impurity problem @xcite , d ) and the renormalization group technique @xcite .",
    "many experimental data , especially the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , seem to suggest the anisotropic @xmath0-wave type structure of both : the pseudogap and true superconducting gap . however , there are also known some measurements , for instance the @xmath3-axis josephson tunneling @xcite and the photoemission spectroscopy on bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite , which provide the strong arguments for a nonzero @xmath1-wave ingredient of the order parameter . in a most realistic situation",
    "one can expect that the order parameter of the htsc cuprates acquires a mixed @xmath6 or @xmath7 i@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "possibility for an appearance of the mixed symmetry superconducting phase has been theoretically explored on quite the general grounds using a 2-dimensional electron system with the anisotropic potential @xmath8 of the arbitrary ( from weak to strong ) attraction strength @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the studies of superconductivity within the bf model have been performed for the isotropic pairing interaction . some attempts to analyze the @xmath0-pairing superconductivity together with a microscopic justification for introducing the bf type hamiltonian",
    "can be found in the paper by geshkenbein _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "very recently , a more formal way has been explored by micnas _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall investigate various kinds of the superconducting phase induced by an anisotropic potential of the bf model in a presence of the coulomb interactions between fermions .",
    "for simplicity we shall concentrate only on a case of the on - site repulsion @xmath9 , where @xmath10 in the wannier representation .",
    "in general , one expects that the on - site repulsion ( which prevents fermions from forming the local pairs ) would compete with the correlations induced by the boson - fermion coupling ( this interaction is a driving force for the pairing in the bf model and is responsible for inducing the pseudogap at temperatures @xmath11 and the true superconducting gap when @xmath12 ) .",
    "we shall address the following question : what is an extent of a detrimental influence of @xmath13 on the pairing correlations ?",
    "the abovementioned competition has been already studied in a normal phase of the bf model using the nonperturbative approach of the dmft @xcite . in our paper",
    "we shall investigate the anisotropic superconducting phase . to make our study feasible we assume that the pairing interactions are relatively weak ( a meaning of this assumption",
    "is explained in the next section ) and we try to estimate the influence of the coulomb repulsion varying its intensity from the weak to strong interaction limits .",
    "hamiltonian of the system under consideration consists of the two parts @xmath14 .",
    "first of them refers to the standard bf model hamiltonian @xcite @xmath15 and the second part denotes the on - site interaction between fermions @xmath16 .",
    "we use here the standard notations for annihilation ( creation ) operators of fermion @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with spin @xmath19 and for the hard - core boson @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) at site @xmath22 of the 2 dimensional square lattice . the indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 in ( [ bf ] ) denote the coordinates of the momentum space .",
    "we assume the tight binding dispersion for fermions @xmath25 , and set the bandwidth @xmath26 as a unit ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is important to remark now that we let the boson - fermion exchange potential @xmath28 to be anisotropic . as explained in the ref .",
    "@xcite the low energy physics of this model is prevailed by bosons of small momenta @xmath29 .",
    "usually , the magnitudes of the superconducting gap in htsc materials are of the order of several @xmath30 ( which is @xmath31 of the bandwidth @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the pairing potential @xmath28 , which establishes the energy scale for @xmath2 and @xmath33 , is small as compared to @xmath32 .",
    "in such a case the following mean field decoupling is justified @xmath34 we further write down the anisotropic potential @xmath35 as a product @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 characterizes the interaction strength and @xmath38 stands for the dimensionless factor which has to reflect the fourfold symmetry of cuo@xmath4 planes of the htsc cuprates . in general the anisotropy factor @xmath38 can be represented as @xmath39 and the coefficients @xmath40 denote a relative contribution of the isotropic , the extended @xmath1-wave , and the @xmath0-wave part into the order parameter of the superconducting phase .",
    "they should be adjusted depending on a specific material . if for example @xmath41 and @xmath42 we would have the order parameter of a mixed @xmath6 , or @xmath7i@xmath0 symmetry . since our main interest",
    "is focused on the competition between the coulomb interaction and the superconductivity we further consider for a clarity only the pure extended @xmath1- or the @xmath0-wave symmetries when @xmath43 .",
    "after the mean field decoupling for the boson - fermion interaction ( [ decoupling ] ) we are left with an effective hamiltonian composed of the separated fermion and boson contributions @xcite",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45 we introduced here the abbreviations for energies measured from the chemical potential @xmath46 , @xmath47 and for the two order parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we can easily solve the hard - core boson part of the problem .",
    "for a given site @xmath22 one finds the true eigenstates using the unitary transformation @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 refer correspondingly to the empty and to the singly occupied ( by the hard - core boson ) site @xmath22 . in a straightforward calculation",
    "we can determine the expectation values for the number operator @xmath54 and for the order parameter @xmath55",
    "@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "first , we consider the weak coupling limit when @xmath13 is fairly smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "we are in a position to utilize then the hartree fock gorkov linearization for the on - site interaction @xmath59 .",
    "hamiltonian of the fermion subsystem ( [ h_f ] ) reduces then simply to the bcs structure @xmath60 with @xmath61 ( we assume a paramagnetic state @xmath62 ) .",
    "a role of the effective gap parameter is played here by @xmath63 where the isotropic part is given by @xmath64 .",
    "standard methods of the solid state theory give the following equations for expectation values @xmath65 with a typical gaped spectrum @xmath66 in the superconducting phase .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in a case of the @xmath0-pairing ( i.e.  for @xmath67 ) the isotropic component @xmath68 of the gap parameter ( [ eff_order ] ) does identically vanish . to prove this",
    "let us substitute ( [ ck_ck ] ) into the definition of @xmath69 to obtain @xmath70 since integration over the brillouin zone of the part containing @xmath71 gives zero so , for @xmath9 , equation ( [ delta_0d ] ) has the only possible solution @xmath72 .",
    "it is not surprising because the repulsive interactions by themselves are not able to induce the on - site fermion pairs .    if the boson fermion potential ( [ bfpotential ] ) is isotropic or takes a form of the @xmath1-wave ( @xmath73 ) then in general @xmath74 . from a consideration similar to the one",
    "discussed above ( equation ( [ delta_0d ] ) is valid except that @xmath71 should be replaced by @xmath38 ) we can determine a relative ratio @xmath75 .",
    "the extended @xmath1-wave gap parameter is now given by @xmath76 for the isotropic boson fermion potential ( @xmath77 ) the equation ( [ extended - s ] ) simplifies further to give a @xmath23-independent gap @xmath78^{-1 } < g\\rho$ ] .",
    "this expression explicitly shows a detrimental role of the on - site repulsion on the isotropic superconducting phase .",
    "such a problem has been previously addressed @xcite neglecting the hard core nature of bosons and using the rpa treatment for the coulomb repulsion .",
    "in a case of the strong interactions ( @xmath79 ) we make use of the slave boson technique proposed by kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we shall consider here only the extreme limit @xmath80 .",
    "we represent the fermion operators as @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where the auxiliary boson operator @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) refers to the annihilation ( creation ) of the empty state at site @xmath22 and fermion operator @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) corresponds to annihilation ( creation ) of the singly occupied site @xmath22 with spin @xmath19 . no double occupancy is allowed and this can be formally expressed via the local constraint @xmath87 .    using the real space ( wannier states ) representation",
    "we can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h_f ] ) in terms of the new operators as @xmath88 we used here the identity @xmath89 @xcite and the last term takes account of the local constraint ( @xmath90 stands for the lagrange multiplier ) .",
    "@xmath91 is the exchange potential whose fourier transform is given by ( [ bfpotential ] ) and , as usually , @xmath92 denotes the hopping integral .",
    "next , we approximate ( [ hf_sb ] ) by : ( i ) replacing the slave boson operators by their expectation values which are assumed to be site independent @xmath93 , and ( ii ) replacing the local multipliers by the global one @xmath94 . in this ( mean field )",
    "approximation for the slave bosons one obtains @xmath95 the global parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 are determined from a minimization of the total energy @xmath98 .",
    "this criterion leads to @xmath99    as can be noticed from the equation ( [ sb_hf_mf ] ) hamiltonian of the fermion subsystem @xmath100 is again reduced to the bcs structure .",
    "we thus have the same solution for the expectation values as given in ( [ n_f],[ck_ck ] ) with a difference that now @xmath101 both , the effective fermion bandwidth @xmath102 and the effective pairing potential @xmath103 , reduce down to zero when fermion occupation approaches the half - filling . under such circumstances the system is driven into the mott insulating state .",
    "finally we consider here a regime of the intermediate @xmath13 for which we adopt the procedure used earlier by us @xcite in a context of the extended hubbard model .",
    "we introduce the nambu representation @xmath104 , @xmath105 and , as a first step , determine the unperturbed green s function @xmath106 neglecting the interaction @xmath13 in the fermion hamiltonian ( [ h_f ] ) @xmath107 \\ ;   g_{0}({\\bf k},i\\omega_{n } )   = { \\bf 1 } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , we compute the dressed green s function using the matrix dyson equation @xmath108 in order to proceed we simplify the selfenergy matrix by the following ansatz @xcite @xmath109 \\;. \\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without specifying the diagonal elements of ( [ sigma ] ) we denote @xmath110 by @xmath111 and make use of the identity @xmath112 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are approximated by us by a contribution corresponding to the result deduced from the mean field type theory discussed in the section iii .",
    "channel of the superconducting correlations is treated by us in ( [ sigma ] ) approximately .",
    "if one knew @xmath113 then the needed expectation values can be found according to the standard field theoretical relation @xmath114 , where @xmath115 . in particular , we obtain @xcite @xmath116 where again @xmath117 is given by ( [ eff_order ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath113 has a meaning of the normal phase selfenergy for the standard hubbard model .",
    "of course there is no exact solution for @xmath118 available so far except maybe from the numerical exact diagonalization or the quantum monte carlo studies .",
    "however , depending on a magnitude of the on - site interaction , one can use various approximate estimations .",
    "let us point out the few possibilities .",
    "starting from the weak interaction limit the simplest substitution for @xmath118 is the mean field value @xmath119 as discussed in section iii . with an increase of @xmath13 one",
    "can proceed by including some higher order corrections , like for example of the second order in @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "going toward the mott transition regime @xmath120 ( for the half - filled fermion system ) one could work for example with the so called alloy analogy approximation ( aaa ) @xcite . in a more subtle way one could estimate the momentum independent selfenergy @xmath121 by adopting the dynamical mean field theory ( which becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions ) .",
    "the strong interaction case can be described in a satisfactory way either with aaa , dmft or the simple hubbard i approximation . here",
    "we apply the aaa procedure to study a regime near the mott transition .",
    "as far as the coulomb repulsion is concerned we expect that its effectiveness should strongly depend on concentration of fermions . in a regime of small fermion concentration ( dilute limit ) this interaction should not be very efficient and , in particular , it would not affect the superconducting type correlations induced by the boson fermion exchange .",
    "on the other hand , we expect that the strongest effects of the on - site coulomb repulsion might appear for a system with a nearly half filled fermion system @xmath122 .    in absence of the coulomb interactions ,",
    "the superconducting phase ( isotropic or anisotropic one ) of the bf model is formed when the fermion concentration is properly adjusted .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath123 must be close enough to the boson level because only then the charge exchange between the hard - core bosons and fermion pairs can induce the long range coherence @xcite .",
    "so , the needed concentration of fermions is roughly given by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 denotes the density of states of the free ( noninteracting ) fermion system .",
    "in this section we present results obtained numerically for the bf model in the two distinct cases when the critical fermion concentration is : a ) small , which takes place when @xmath126 lies fair aside the center of fermion band , b ) close to half - filling , when @xmath126 is located in the center of fermion band .",
    "we thus choose the two following values @xmath127 and @xmath128 , see figure ( [ demo ] ) .",
    "we take the boson fermion potential @xmath129 in all the results discussed below .",
    "figure ( [ fig1 ] ) shows the critical temperature @xmath2 of the @xmath0- wave superconducting phase for several values of @xmath13 .",
    "this type of superconductivity is enhanced near the half - filled fermion system similarly as in the extended hubbard model @xcite . in agreement to our expectations",
    ", the coulomb repulsion only weakly reduces @xmath2 in a dilute fermion system .",
    "however , for @xmath130 we notice a considerable reduction of @xmath2 or even a disappearance of superconductivity for @xmath131 ( total concentration is then @xmath132 ) when @xmath13 exceeds the critical mott transition value @xmath133 . for such a strong potential @xmath13 the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase is restricted to a narrower regime of the total concentration , such that there are no doubly occupied fermion states on a given lattice site ( remember we are considering the intersite cooper pairs ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig2 ] ) illustrates the effect of @xmath13 on the extended @xmath1-wave phase . in a dilute regime",
    "we notice almost identical values of @xmath2 for both the @xmath0- and extended @xmath1-wave superconducting phases .",
    "also the influence of @xmath13 is there very similar .",
    "a remarkable difference appears for @xmath130 when the fermion system is near the half - filling @xmath134 .",
    "critical temperature @xmath2 of the @xmath1-wave phase is then 3 times smaller as compared to the @xmath0-wave phase .",
    "the system is thus less susceptible for the @xmath1 type pairing near @xmath134 ( for @xmath135 it corresponds to @xmath136 ) .",
    "one notices also some `` peculiar '' behavior of @xmath137 for the extended @xmath1-wave phase cased by an increasing strength of @xmath13 . with a small increase of @xmath13",
    "the whole diagram is somewhat shifted and simultaneously the optimal value of @xmath2 slightly increases .",
    "this overall shift is caused by the hartree term @xmath138 ( see the section iii ) which effectively pulls up the fermion band with respect to the boson energy level . by comparing the curves corresponding to @xmath139 in the upper and bottom panels of figure ( [ fig2 ] ) we realize that such shift is responsible for enhancing the @xmath1-wave type superconductivity , but only when @xmath13 is safely smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "a further increase of the coulomb interaction @xmath13 proves to be detrimental on superconductivity ( independently of a symmetry of the order parameter ) because the fermion subsystem is driven into the mott insulating state .    to analyze in more detail a pronounced effect of the coulomb interaction on superconductivity for the half - filled fermion system @xmath134 ( @xmath136 )",
    "we show in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath13 .",
    "the results have been obtained by means of the alloy analogy approximation mentioned in section iii and discussed earlier by the same author in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath140 tight binding dispersion",
    "we determine the mott transition at @xmath141 in units of the initial fermion band .",
    "this value is probably underestimated .",
    "the most credible determination based on the dynamical mean field theory usually yields @xmath133 larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a qualitative behavior presented in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) remains valid . as we see by comparing to the figures ( [ fig1],[fig2 ] ) the aaa treatment properly interpolates between @xmath139 and @xmath142 limits .",
    "summarizing , we have investigated the anisotropic superconductivity within the boson fermion model in a presence of the coulomb repulsion between fermions .",
    "+ ( a ) in a dilute regime of the fermion concentration the effect of the coulomb repulsion proves to be rather weak .",
    "for both the @xmath0- and extended @xmath1-wave phase we observe up to 25 @xmath143 reduction of the optimal @xmath2 value when @xmath80 .",
    "both anisotropic phases survive , even in the limit of infinitely strong coulomb repulsions . + ( b ) in the nearly half - filled fermion system we observe an enhancement of the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase and a simultaneous suppression of the @xmath1-wave phase until the interaction @xmath13 is small .",
    "+ ( c ) around the mott transition @xmath141 both phases are reduced to the concentration regime @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "still , the superconductivity is able to survive at sufficiently large hole concentration @xmath146 .",
    "such a case is relevant for a description of the htsc materials and boson fermion model seems to capable to reproduce qualitatively the phase diagrams known for these materials .    among the problems which are not addressed in this paper",
    "there is a very intriguing question : what happens to pseudogap of the normal phase ( discussed earlier in the refs @xcite and in @xcite in a presence of coulomb interactions ?",
    "consideration of this subject is in a progress and the results shall be discussed elsewhere .",
