    "quantised vortices in superfluids have been the subject of an important research area since their theoretical prediction in the context of liquid helium @xcite . in the last years",
    "there has been intense experimental and theoretical study on the creation and dynamics of single vortices as well as vortex lattices in ultracold atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "these systems offer the possibility for direct observation of vortex lines and of their dymamics .",
    "they are thus excellent systems for a comprehensive theoretical study of vortex lines in three dimensions .    in an experiment performed in a spherical trap @xcite",
    "single vortices were produced by a technique which induces a @xmath0 phase winding using a rotating laser beam .",
    "the vortices were located off the trap center , and they were seen to precess robustly around it at an almost constant angular velocity . surprisingly the precession frequency was found to be almost independent of the displacement of the vortex from the trap center .    in another important experiment",
    "it was established that the vortex lines in the finite trap geometry can have nontrivial shapes @xcite .",
    "it was observed that a single vortex line may have an s shape or a u shape .",
    "the length and precise shape of the vortex can vary and this is directly related to the angular momentum it carries .",
    "theoretical work in high density very elongated condensates similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the u - shaped vortex can be the ground state of the rotating system @xcite .",
    "some differences between the s and the u - vortex were reported in @xcite .    in this paper , we establish that an axisymmetric bec generically supports both s and u - shaped vortices .",
    "we study these single vortices as precessing stationary states within the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii theory for a range of interaction strengths .",
    "their frequency of precession around the trap center depends critically on the features of the vortex line .",
    "precession frequencies for u - vortices depend only weakly on their angular momentum and fall in a relatively narrow frequency range which depends on the interaction strength .",
    "s - vortices have higher energy and their precession frequencies depend strongly on their angular momentum .",
    "the nonrotating member of this family is a non - axially symmetric vortex solution of the nonlinear theory .",
    "this has been called a _ solitonic vortex _ ; it breaks spontaneously the symmetry in an axially symmetric potential and pierces through the trap in a direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis @xcite .    in the dilute limit",
    "the low - energy states can be described within a lowest landau level ( lll ) ansatz @xcite .",
    "motivated by the fact that experiments are usually performed in elongated condensates we generalize the lll ansatz to include longitudinal modes .",
    "both types of single vortex states can then be described within this formalism and some simple analytic expressions capture the main features of the vortex modes .",
    "low density condensates close to the lll regime have been created recently by fast rotation where a vortex lattice was formed @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the problem and find numerically two types of single vortex solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we apply our method for a spherical trap as in @xcite as well as for elongated condensates . in sec .",
    "iii we formulate the problem in the lll augmented to include the longitudinal modes and we study the s and u - vortices within this formalism .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv contains a summary and our concluding remarks .",
    "motivated by the experiment @xcite where off - center vortices precess at an almost constant angular velocity around the center of the condensate , we look here for vortices which are stationary states in a frame rotating at a constant frequency . in this paper",
    "we suppose that the energy of a bec is given by the gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "we consider an axially symmetric harmonic potential with frequencies @xmath1 in the transverse direction and @xmath2 in the longitudinal direction and implement rationalised units by the substitutions @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the condensate wave function , @xmath5 is the number of atoms in the condensate , and @xmath6 are the oscillator lengths in the transverse and longitudinal directions .",
    "the wave function normalisation condition reads @xmath7 the energy functional per particle in units of @xmath8 has the form @xmath9   \\left .",

    "the value @xmath15 corresponds to a spherical trap .",
    "the quartic term gives the strength of the interactions and we introduce for later convenience the parameter @xmath16 which is a dimensionless measure of the interaction strength relative to the transverse trapping energy @xmath8 .",
    "stationary states which precess at a constant angular frequency @xmath17 are extrema of the energy in the rotating frame : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angular momentum per particle along the symmetry axis , in units of @xmath20 : @xmath21 the star denotes complex conjugation , and the frequency @xmath17 is measured in units of @xmath1 .",
    "extremizing numerically the energy functional ( [ eq : e - omegal ] ) is often not practically convenient because some of the interesting solutions may not correspond to its minima .",
    "therefore , we define the lyapunov functional @xmath22 where we have introduced the constants @xmath23 .",
    "an extremum of @xmath24 corresponds to an extremum of @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "we find the minima of @xmath24 by using a variant of a numerical norm - preserving relaxation algorithm @xcite which , in effect , capitalizes on a virial relation @xcite in order to converge to a wave function of unit norm .",
    "the method is applied on a three - dimensional grid in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath24 is that we can find stationary points which are not necessarily minima of @xmath25 .",
    "the constants @xmath23 should be chosen so as to ensure convergence to the desired value of the angular momentum , say @xmath27 .",
    "this usually amounts to choosing @xmath28 close to @xmath27 , while @xmath29 should be positive and large enough so that the stationary point at @xmath27 be a minimum .",
    "once the solutions for a range of angular momenta are known the frequency is given by @xmath30 .",
    "we first apply the method for parameters similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "since the trap is spherical any arbitrary axis in space can be chosen as the z - axis along which @xmath19 is measured .",
    "we find vortex states for the range of angular momenta @xmath32 and we present images of the particle density for some representative ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornell_images ] .",
    "the condensate is at the nonrotating spherically symmetric ground state for @xmath33 . for @xmath34",
    "a vortex line enters the condensate . as @xmath19",
    "is increased the vortex line is closer to the center and it is curved for @xmath35 ; it becomes the axially symmetric vortex at the center of the condensate for @xmath36 .",
    "following @xcite we call the vortex mode in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornell_images ] the _ u - vortex_.    the angular momentum @xmath19 as a function of the precession frequency @xmath17 of the vortex around the @xmath37-axis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornell ] .",
    "we find that single vortex states with @xmath38 have frequencies in the range @xmath39 . however , except for very low values of @xmath19 the branch has frequencies in a narrow frequency range , say , @xmath40 0.19 to 0.25 . in physical units",
    "the frequency @xmath41 defined from @xmath42 takes values in the range @xmath43 ( e.g. , @xmath44 hz for @xmath45 ) ; which is in agreement with the value 1.8 hz measured in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the precession frequency of the vortex is explained in terms of an anomalous mode of the bogoliubov spectrum and it is related to its stability .",
    "the frequencies 1.58 hz given in the above reference should be compared with the limiting frequency ( 1.56 hz ) obtained in our calculation .",
    "a somewhat counterintuitive feature of the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornell ] is that the precession frequency decreases as the angular momentum increases , which means that vortices closer to the axis precess slower .",
    "this point is discussed further at the end of this section in connection with stability .    further in this section we expand our calculations to axially symmetric elongated traps .",
    "this is an important direction since the majority of experiments involving vortices have been performed in elongated condensates .",
    "previous theoretical work on few - vortex solutions has focused on very dense elongated condensates which are practically in the thomas - fermi regime @xcite and satisfy the condition @xmath46 . in this section",
    "we shall focus on the regime @xmath47 .",
    "we present here a calculation for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . using na atoms and trapping frequencies @xmath50 hz ,",
    "@xmath51 , these values are obtained for @xmath52 atoms ( @xmath53 for rb ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] we show by a solid line the angular momentum for the u - vortex as a function of the precession frequency .",
    "the angular momentum is a decreasing function of @xmath17 , and the precession frequency range over which the u - vortex exists is narrow and it is located at much higher frequencies compared to fig .  [",
    "fig : cornell ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvortex_d2 ] we present images of the u - vortices for various values of the angular momentum .",
    "vortices are off - center and slightly curved .",
    "the axially symmetric vortex is obtained as the limit for a frequency @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite study a solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation which has been called the _",
    "solitonic vortex_. this appears to be different than all the vortices discussed in this section so far .",
    "the solitonic vortex is an excited state in an elongated non - rotating condensate which pierces through the trap in a direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis and therefore it has angular momentum @xmath33 ( along the symmetry axis ) .",
    "an example is shown in the first entry of fig .",
    "[ fig : svortex_d2 ] .",
    "the solitonic vortex exists for sufficiently high interaction strengths and it bifurcates from the dark soliton solution .",
    "we notice that the solitonic vortex breaks spontaneously the axial symmetry and if we assume a finite precession frequency @xmath17 , it may acquire a nonvanishing angular momentum @xmath55 . in order to explore this possibility we use the solitonic vortex solution as an initial guess in our numerical algorithm and choose appropriate values for the constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - omegal ] ) .",
    "representative results for vortex solutions with @xmath56 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : svortex_d2 ] , for an elongated condensate ( @xmath48 ) and for an interaction strength constant @xmath49 .",
    "the first entry , for @xmath33 , is the solitonic vortex and the next entries show almost straight vortex lines which are tilted with respect to the @xmath37 axis . as the frequency increases the vortex line progressively aligns with the symmetry axis while its angular momentum increases .",
    "the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath17 is shown by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] .",
    "this mode , which may be called the _ s - vortex _ following @xcite , gives the axially symmetric vortex ( @xmath36 ) at a limiting frequency @xmath57 ( this value should be compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegas ] ) in sec .",
    "thus the s and the u - vortex are two different types of single vortex states in elongated condensates .",
    "the picture summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] , [ fig : uvortex_d2 ] , and [ fig : svortex_d2 ] is apparently robust for large interaction strengths . in particular , in the experiments in @xcite and in refs .",
    "@xcite s and u - vortices are found in condensates which are practically in the thomas - fermi regime ( @xmath46 ) . unlike in the present case",
    ", all vortices were found to be distinctly curved . also , in @xcite the limiting ( @xmath36 ) frequencies for the axially symmetric vortex appear to coincide for both the s and the u - vortex .",
    "these differences should be attributed to the thomas - fermi nature of the condensates studied in the above references .    in order to complete the study of s - vortices we note that the qualitative picture should be modified for low interaction strengths .",
    "this is because the solitonic vortex is a solution of the nonlinear theory which exists only above a certain value of the interaction strength , @xmath58 , which depends on @xmath59 @xcite . in order to explore the regime @xmath60 we choose @xmath61 in the elongated trap with @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] shows the angular momentum of the vortex modes as a function of the precession frequency .",
    "a substantial modification for the s - vortex is that now @xmath62 for a finite limiting frequency @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 we obtain an axially symmetric wave function with a node on the @xmath65 plane which , in the context of the present nonlinear theory , is called a _ dark soliton _ by comparison to the dark soliton of the nonlinear schrdinger equation . summarizing , the picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] could also be described as following : a dark soliton which may initially be created in a trap would not respond to rotations of the system until we exceed a limiting frequency 0.26 .",
    "for @xmath66 it could turn into an s - vortex which would become an axially symmetric one for @xmath67 ( these frequencies should be compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) in sec .",
    "iii when setting @xmath33 and @xmath36 respectively . )",
    "finally , we note that the particle density plots for the s - vortices are qualitatively similar to those for higher interaction strengths presented above ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : svortex_d2 ] ) , except , of course , for the @xmath33 case .    the u - vortex branch is qualitatively similar to its counterpart for @xmath49 but its frequency range is shifted closer to the transverse trapping frequency ( @xmath1 ) while it becomes narrower as @xmath68 decreases .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a series of virial relations are derived which should be satisfied by any vortex solution .",
    "we have checked that the solutions presented here have , in particular , the counterintuitive property that the moments of the particle density vanish : @xmath69 .",
    "this is trivially satisfied by the s - vortex due to its symmetry along the @xmath37 axis , but it is a nontrivial result for the u - vortex .",
    "we comment briefly on the relation of the vortex modes presented here to vortices in helium ii . in ref .",
    "@xcite an equation is derived for the dynamics of a vortex line in a rotating bucket containing the superfluid and it is found that there are vortex lines precessing on an unstable orbit around the bucket center at some distance @xmath70 which is an increasing function of the precession frequency . since the angular momentum of the vortex is a decreasing function of @xmath70 ( as discussed in @xcite ) , we conclude that the angular momentum is a decreasing function of the precession frequency , that is the situation is analogous to that for the u - vortex in figs .",
    "[ fig : cornell],[fig : d2 ] , and [ fig : a2 ] .",
    "we finally turn to the delicate issue of stability of the calculated vortex states . according to @xcite `` mechanical stability ''",
    "requires that the energy be a convex function of angular momentum : @xmath71 .",
    "however , this is a condition for stability of the solution in the rotating frame under variations that change the angular momentum . in experiments in which the trap is axially symmetric ( , when the system is no longer being stirred ) ,",
    "the angular momentum is conserved and this condition is irrelevant for the stability of the modes : what is relevant is that the mode should be _ dynamically stable _ against decay into other modes which have the same angular momentum .",
    "as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : cornell ] the precessing u - vortex has @xmath72 , so it does not satisfy the criterion of mechanical stability of ref .",
    "however , the u - vortex must be dynamically stable since it is the lowest energy configuration for given angular momentum @xmath73 as we know from the calculations in the present section . indeed the u - vortex has been seen in experiments @xcite in which angular momentum is conserved .",
    "it is also interesting to comment on the issue of overall _ thermodynamic _ stability of the rotating system .",
    "a single axially symmetric ( @xmath36 ) vortex will have lower energy in the rotating frame than the nonrotating ground state if @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the vortex energy and @xmath76 is the ground state energy @xcite . now , taking into account that @xmath77 , we may write @xmath78 applying this relation for the u - vortex calculated for a spherical trap with @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ fig : cornell ] ) we find @xmath79 or , in physical units , @xmath80 hz which lies in the range of precession frequencies for the u - vortex .",
    "we now turn to discuss more specifically dilute condensates which offer the possibility to study vortex modes in the limit of a small interaction strength where the energy levels of the system are close to those of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this analysis will provide an analytic description of the features of the s and u - vortices . in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy @xmath25 of a rotating system is minimised in the case of the very dilute limit in the sense that the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) is much smaller than the other energy scales , namely @xmath81 , or @xmath82 the problem is then reduced to the lowest landau level ( lll ) on the transverse plane ( @xmath83 ) while the wave function in the longitudinal direction @xmath37 is the gaussian ground state of the 1d harmonic oscillator .",
    "we refer to this as the 2d lll regime .",
    "an analytic solution for vortices with angular momentum in the range @xmath84 is given in @xcite .",
    "the minimisation of @xmath25 gives the gaussian nonrotating ground state as the global minimum for @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 the axially symmetric vortex becomes the global minimum of the functional ( [ eq : e - omegal ] ) .",
    "exactly at @xmath87 there is a set of states with @xmath38 which are off - center vortices .",
    "these are denoted by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lll ] which shows the angular momentum as a function of the precession frequency . for higher values of @xmath17",
    "( but still lower than the transverse frequency of the potential ) many - vortex states and vortex lattices become the absolute minimum @xcite .",
    "all vortex lines are parallel to the symmetry axis of the trap since this is a 2d calculation . for larger values of @xmath68",
    "these evolve in the curved vortex lines as , , in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornell_images ] and thus they correspond to the u - vortex mode discussed in the previous section .    in elongated traps excited states of the rotating condensate can be found without mixing higher landau levels .",
    "this is an interesting issue also because most experiments involving vortices , and in particular those in which the shapes of individual vortex lines were studied , were performed in very elongated traps , that is at @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we first consider the case of a non - interacting gas , , @xmath89 , whose first excited state has a node in the @xmath37 direction : @xmath90 its energy is @xmath91 , and has vanishing angular momentum .",
    "we note that for increasing @xmath68 the wave function @xmath92 evolves to the dark soliton in the framework of the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii model .",
    "a further excited state is of the vortex type : @xmath93 and it has energy @xmath94 and angular momentum @xmath36 .",
    "it is thus obvious that for the frequency @xmath95 the two states ( [ eq : soliton ] ) and ( [ eq : vortex ] ) have the same energy @xmath25 in the rotating frame . for @xmath96 we have @xmath92 as the first excited state while @xmath97 becomes the first excited state for @xmath98 .",
    "the simple picture is modified in the presence of a weak interaction term , that is , for @xmath68 small but finite .",
    "for @xmath99 we make the ansatz @xmath100 where the coefficients @xmath101 are constrained by @xmath102 and @xmath103 . substituting @xmath4 in ( [ eq : energy ] )",
    "we find the energy of the first excited state as a function of the angular momentum @xmath19 : @xmath104 where we have subtracted the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator @xmath105 , a convention that will be adopted from now on .",
    "now , @xmath106 has a minimum for any @xmath19 in the range @xmath38 and a frequency @xmath77 or @xmath107 as depicted by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lll ] . for @xmath108",
    "the wave function is @xmath109 ( @xmath33 ) while for @xmath110 we have @xmath111 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the vortex line represented by the ansatz ( [ eq : twostates ] ) is found by setting @xmath112 where for simplicity we may consider @xmath101 real . for frequencies in the range",
    "@xmath113 we have @xmath114 and thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilted ] ) gives a straight vortex line which is tilted with respect to the symmetry axis @xmath37 .",
    "summarizing , the first excited state ( [ eq : twostates ] ) has a wave function with a nodal plane perpendicular to the @xmath37 axis for low frequencies which turns to a tilted vortex for @xmath115 .",
    "this gradually aligns with the symmetry axis as the frequency increases .",
    "it becomes the axially symmetric vortex above the limiting frequency @xmath116 .",
    "this is the weak interaction limit of the s - vortex discussed in the previous section .",
    "both the s and the u - vortex become the axially symmetric vortex for a sufficiently high @xmath17 .",
    "however , the corresponding limiting frequencies for the two types of vortices do not coincide .",
    "in fact , there is no sense of precession in an axially symmetric vortex and the limiting frequency may be absorbed into an effective chemical potential @xmath117 while the wave function reduces to a quasi static configuration with chemical potential @xmath118 .",
    "we are able to take our calculation one step further if we assume a very elongated trap , , @xmath88 , and an interaction strength comparable to the latter energy scale : @xmath119 in this case it is useful to extend the lll calculation to 3d by including higher axial oscillator states .",
    "we use the wave function ansatz @xmath120 where @xmath121 are complex constants , @xmath122 are eigenstates of the 2d harmonic oscillator and @xmath123 form a basis for the expansion of the wave function in the axial direction . we aim to find the vortex states for a fixed angular momentum within the present ansatz . an efficient way to do this is by minimizing the lyapunov functional @xmath124 where @xmath19 is the angular momentum functional of eq .",
    "( [ eq : angular ] ) and @xmath125 .",
    "the constants @xmath126 are chosen so as to obtain a solution for the desired number of particles and angular momentum .",
    "we substitute the wave function ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) in ( [ eq : extended2 ] ) and minimise @xmath127 with respect to @xmath121 by a conjugate gradient method .",
    "computer limitations allow for modes typically up to @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "when the interaction term is small , , @xmath130 the algorithm converges to the two single - vortex solutions which were discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lll ] .",
    "specifically , for the u - vortex we have that all @xmath121 with @xmath131 vanish . for the s - vortex",
    "we have that only @xmath132 are nonzero .",
    "when @xmath68 becomes comparable or greater than @xmath59 several @xmath121 are nonzero and their values decrease with respect to both indices . for the s - vortex",
    "we find that all @xmath121 with @xmath133 even vanish , and this is consistent with the symmetry of an s - shaped vortex . for the u - vortex",

    "[ fig:3dlll ] shows the angular momentum of the two vortices as a function of precession frequency for parameter values @xmath136 .",
    "the most dramatic effect is seen in the u - vortex where @xmath137 is now positive except for small values of @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the abrupt transition from the @xmath33 to the @xmath36 state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lll ] is smoothed out and the angular momentum of the u - vortex is now a smooth function of the frequency @xmath17 , although the range of frequencies corresponding to @xmath138 is narrow .",
    "the vortices in the latter range are located off - center while the contribution of modes with @xmath139 in the wave function ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) means that vortex lines are curved .",
    "the s - vortex lines are also curved and the slope of the branch ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig:3dlll ] ) is not constant unlike in fig .",

    "the s - vortex has higher energy than the u - vortex but both curves converge to the same value for @xmath36 which is the energy of the axially symmetric vortex @xmath97 .",
    "we have analysed the two single vortex modes , the s - vortex and the u - vortex , which are stationary states of the gross - pitaevskii model precessing at a constant frequency @xmath17 in a bec confined in an axially symmetric harmonic potential .",

    "perhaps the s - vortex is also related to shape deformations of vortex lines observed in the form on kelvin modes @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis for vortex solutions could be carried out for a dilute condensate within a 3d lowest landau level calculation which includes the axial oscillator states .",
    "we have given a derivation for the s - vortex which is complementary to the lll calculation for the u - vortex @xcite .",
    "including the axial oscillator states causes the transition from a nonrotating ground state to an axially symmetric vortex to happen smoothly as the rotation frequency increases : vortices with angular momentum @xmath19 less than unity are thermodynamically stable .",
    "both the s and the u - vortex become axially symmetric in the limit @xmath140 but this happens at different frequencies in the two cases .",
    "this seems to be in disagreement with the results reported in @xcite , however , one should note that in the latter reference very elongated and very dense condensates are studied .",
    "although the results are related , an extrapolation of our results to the thomas - fermi regime , and thus a direct comparison to @xcite , does not appear straightforward .",
    "we further find that , for weak interactions , an s - vortex line is only slightly bent in contrast to the original observations in @xcite . in fact , both vortex modes in the dilute limit presented in fig .  [ fig : lll ] represent straight vortex lines .",
    "however , as the density increases vortex lines tend to bend ( as , , in figs .  [",
    "fig : uvortex_d2],[fig : svortex_d2 ] ) .",

    "<S> we establish that for given angular momentum the s - vortex has higher energy than the u - vortex in a rotating elongated condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the s - vortex is related to the solitonic vortex which is a nonlinear excitation in the nonrotating system . for small interaction strengths the s - vortex </S>",
    "<S> is related to the dark soliton . in the dilute limit a lowest landau level calculation </S>",
    "<S> provides an analytic description of these vortex modes in terms of the harmonic oscillator states . </S>"
