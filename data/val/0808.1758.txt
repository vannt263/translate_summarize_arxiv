    "correlated electron systems often exhibit behavior that are substantively different from what is expected within one - electron ( 1-e ) theory .",
    "in particular , the classification of materials as simple metals or semiconductors breaks down for sufficiently strong electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "the effects of e - e interactions are particularly strong in low dimension , and carbon - based quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) systems such as @xmath1-conjugated polymers , semiconducting and conducting charge - transfer solids , and carbon nanotubes commonly exhibit novel behavior ascribed to e - e interactions .",
    "although it is by now generally accepted that coulomb interactions between the @xmath1-electrons are strong in single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) , they continue to be classified as metallic ( m - swcnts ) and semiconducting ( s - swcnts ) , based on the predictions of 1-e theory .",
    "thus , swcnts with chirality indices ( n , m ) are commonly referred to as metallic if ( n - m ) = 3j , where j is an integer including zero , and semiconducting otherwise .",
    "schematic @xmath1-electron tight - binding band structures of the armchair ( n = m ) and nonarmchair ( n@xmath3 m , including m=0 ) m - swcnts are shown in fig .  1 . the innermost valence and conduction bands ( vb and cb , respectively ) have linear dispersions and meet at dirac points , which constitute the fermi points here .",
    "the crossing innermost bands are missing in the s - swcnts ; otherwise their bandstructures are similar to that in fig  1(b ) .",
    "we continue to use the nomenclature based on 1-e theory for simplicity in what follows , with the recognition that simple classifications of swcnts may not be entirely meaningful .     and",
    "e@xmath2 transitions occur in the s - swcnts , which do not have the inner crossing bands .",
    ", width=3 ]    in recent years , there has been a strong interest in the consequences of e - e interactions on the photophysics of s - swcnts .",
    "the bulk of the existing literature is on optical absorptions polarized parallel to the nt axes , where e - e interactions lead to exciton formation .",
    "the exciton character of the longitudinally polarized absorptions in s - swcnts @xcite is now firmly established .",
    "nonlinear absorption@xcite and two - photon induced fluorescence @xcite have demonstrated that the binding energy of the lowest longitudinal optical exciton in s - swcnts is substantial relative to the optical gap .",
    "research on optical absorptions polarized _ perpendicular _ to the nt axes has been less extensive @xcite , but the consequences of e - e interactions here are even more dramatic . within 1-e theory ,",
    "the perpendicularly polarized absorption occurs exactly at the center of the two lowest longitudinally polarized absorptions ( hereafter e@xmath4 and e@xmath2 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the experimentally observed strong blueshift of the perpendicularly polarized absorption @xcite to near e@xmath2 is due to e - e interactions @xcite .",
    "there exists also a considerable body of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite literature on the effects of e - e interactions on the m - swcnts , that until recently had focused mostly on transport behavior .",
    "screening of the interactions between the @xmath1-electrons in these 1d systems is weak , and the lowest excitations in m - swcnts have been shown to correspond to those of a luttinger liquid ( ll ) rather than a fermi liquid . indeed , it has been claimed @xcite that the lowest excitations of an ( n , n ) armchair m - swcnts can be approximately mapped onto those of two - leg `` hubbard ladders '' @xcite with an effective on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the repulsion between two electrons occupying the same @xmath0 carbon orbital .",
    "given that @xmath6 is substantial in carbon - based systems @xcite , this would suggest that the narrowest armchair nanotubes with diameters @xmath7 nm are likely mott - hubbard semiconductors with both charge- and spin - gaps .",
    "@xcite although excitations in nonarmchair m - swcnts are more complex , it is believed that the low energy physics of these are the same as in the armchair tubes . finally , while the above discussions concerning the mott - hubbard semiconductor nature of the narrowest m - swcnts focused on the short - range component of the e - e interactions , the charging energy of a tube is determined primarily by the long - range component , which has also been shown",
    "to be weakly screened @xcite .",
    "fitting the experimental charging energy of a m - swcnt @xcite with a 1/@xmath8 potential , for example , requires a dielectric constant of only 1.4 @xcite .",
    "it is in this context that we examine theoretically the photophysics of m - swcnts here .",
    "we are concerned not about the lowest excitations involving the electrons occupying the innermost bands in fig .  1 , but optical transitions in the visible region .",
    "electronic transitions leading to optical absorptions within 1-e theory are indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition to the vb - to - cb transitions that are polarized parallel to the nt axes , we expect also midgap transitions polarized perpendicular to the nt axes , based on our experience with the s - swcnts .",
    "@xcite only the absorptions parallel to the nt - axis have been experimentally investigated in m - swcnts so far .",
    "@xcite in view of the weak screening of the e - e interactions in m - swcnts ( see above ) , we expect the `` large hubbard @xmath6 '' description to be appropriate here , _ even if these systems are conducting and are not mott - hubbard semiconductors _ note that unlike in true 1d , the hubbard @xmath6 has to be larger than a critical value before a metal - to - insulator transition will occur in graphene .",
    "conducting behavior thus is not a signature of reduced @xmath6 . taken together with with the large atomic u scenario , the 1:1 correspondence of the vb - to - cb transitions in fig .",
    "1 to those in the s - swcnts then suggests that photoexcitations in m - swcnts are to excitons with binding energies that are perhaps comparable to those in the s - swcnts .",
    "this conjecture is , however , in strong contradiction to existing theoretical results .",
    "@xcite within the latter method the ground state is determined using an _ ab initio _ approach , which is followed by the determination of the quasiparticle energies within the gw approximation and the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation of the two - particle green s function .",
    "this technique has claimed that binding energies in m - swcnts are an order of magnitude smaller than those in s - swcnts with comparable diameters . a recent work has also claimed that the experimental e@xmath2 absorption of the ( 21,21 ) armchair m - swcnt can be fit well within the _ ab initio _ theory , and that the exciton binding energy in this system is only 0.05 ev @xcite .",
    "the absence of two - photon induced flourescence in m - swcnts ( because of the inner vb and cb ) has prevented the direct measurement of exciton binding energies .",
    "it then becomes imperative to investigate the photophysics of m - swcnts theoretically using other approaches .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the results of many - body calculations of the photophysics of m - swcnts , based on a molecular hamiltonian that has previously yielded quantitatively accurate results for the absolute exciton energies , exciton binding energies and nonlinear absorption in s - swcnts @xcite . the exciton binding energies we obtain for m - swcnts are considerably larger than those found in reference . in agreement with the earlier ll theories ,",
    "our results indicate that screening of the electron - hole interactions in m - swcnts is considerably weaker than in conventional metals . in section",
    "ii we present our @xmath1-electron hamiltonian and indicate how the parameters of the hamiltonian are obtained .",
    "we then give a brief justification of the choice of our parameters .",
    "in section iii.a we present our theoretical results for linear and nonlinear absorptions in the m - swcnts .",
    "our results for the absolute exciton energies are in excellent agreement with experiments for all twelve m - swcnts that we have studied .",
    "our calculated exciton binding energies are much larger than those predicted within the _ ab initio _ theory . in section iii.b we compare our calculated absorption spectrum of the ( 21,21 )",
    "m - swcnt with the experimental spectrum .",
    "@xcite again , excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental absorption spectra is obtained . finally , in section iii.c we present our predicted theoretical absorption spectra polarized perpendicular to the nt axes .",
    "as with the s - swcnts , @xcite the perpendicularly polarized absorptions show dramatic effects of e - e interactions .",
    "unlike in the s - swcnts , though , the lowest perpendicularly polarized absorptions will occur _ below _ the lowest logitudinal absorption in the m - swcnts . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions , focusing on the difference between our results and those obtained within the _ ab initio _ approach .",
    "we investigate theoretically the photophysics of m - swcnts within the same @xmath1-electron pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) @xcite model that we have used for the s - swcnts @xcite and planar @xmath1-conjugated polymers @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 creates a @xmath1-electron of spin @xmath11 on carbon atom @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the number of electrons on atom @xmath12 with spin @xmath11 and @xmath14 is the total number of electrons on atom @xmath12 . here",

    "we parametrize @xmath16 as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance between carbon atoms @xmath12 and @xmath19 in  , and @xmath20 is the background dielectric constant . since full many - body calculations are not possible within eq .",
    "[ h_ppp ] , we use the single - configuration interaction ( sci ) , which retains all matrix elements between single - excitations from the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state .",

    "the three independent parameters within eq .  [ h_ppp ] are @xmath15 , @xmath6 and @xmath20 .",
    "the nearest neighbor hopping integral is widely accepted to be 2.4 ev in planar @xmath1-conjugated systems .",
    "@xcite the hopping in swcnts is smaller because of the curvature , which decreases the overlaps between neighboring p@xmath21 orbitals .",
    "a smaller @xmath15 of 2.0 ev for s - swcnts was determined from careful fitting of the experimental data .",
    "@xcite since the curvature effects in m - swcnt s are the same as in s - swcnts , we use the same @xmath22 ev as in the s - swcnts .",
    "not surprisingly , the hubbard on - site repulsion @xmath6 is found to be the same in both @xmath1-conjugated polymers @xcite and s - swcnts @xcite , viz .",
    ", 8 ev , which would place both these classes of materials among strongly correlated - electron systems . in the context of a different class of 1d correlated - electron materials , organic charge - transfer solids ,",
    "it has been shown by numerous authors in the past that the short - range e - e interaction , in particular the hubbard @xmath6 , remains practically unchanged between the @xmath23-filled band semiconductors and the non-@xmath23-filled conductors @xcite .",
    "this conclusion has been substantiated by more recent work @xcite and is also in agreement with theories of high temperature superconductors , within which the undoped mott - hubbard semiconductors and the doped conductors and superconductors are generally assumed to have the same @xmath6 .",
    "based on prior work , we therefore expect the hubbard @xmath6 to be the same in m - swcnts and s - swcnts , and use @xmath24 ev in our calculations repored here .",
    "the long range interaction @xmath16 in m - swcnts , however , can be different from s - swcnts due to screening , and this is taken into account by modifying @xmath20 .",
    "we arrive at the appropriate @xmath20 by comparing the experimental lowest longitudinal exciton energies in three different m - swcnts : ( 8,8 ) armchair , ( 12,0 ) zigzag and ( 9,6 ) chiral with ppp - sci energies , calculated using multiple values of @xmath20 . in table",
    "i we show our comparisons of the calculated and experimental quantities for the ( 8,8 ) , ( 12,0 ) and ( 9,6 ) m - swcnts .",
    "the two nonarmchair m - swcnts , in which e@xmath4 splits into a lower e@xmath25 and an upper e@xmath26 due to trigonal warping @xcite , provide rigorous tests of our theory . as seen in the table , while the @xmath20 appropriate for m - swcnts is certainly larger than the value 2 used for s - swcnts,@xcite @xmath27 yields exciton energies that are too small .",
    "the only exception to this is e@xmath25 for the ( 12,0 ) nt .",
    "note , however , that ( i ) this is the narrowest nt considered ( as has been emphasized in reference , @xmath1-electron theory becomes less quantitative for small @xmath28 ) , and ( ii ) even here the best fit to e@xmath26 is with @xmath29 .",
    "we have therefore chosen @xmath29 in what follows .",
    "justification of the choice of our hamiltonian and our parameters come from two considerations .",
    "first , previous theoretical works on m - swcnts have already emphasized weak screening of e - e interactions in m - swcnts .",
    "@xcite our determination that @xmath20 in m - swcnts is only slightly larger than that in s - swcnts agrees with the conclusion of reference that fitting the charging energy in m - swcnts requires a relatively small dielectric constant .",
    "second , in the case of s - swcnts , the ppp - sci approach has provided the best agreement with experimental absolute exciton energies and exciton binding energies to date for nanotubes with @xmath30 1 nm . the _ maximum _ difference between our previously calculated and experimental e@xmath4 for s - swcnts with diameters in this range is 0.05 ev , while for slightly narrower tubes with @xmath28 between 0.75 - 1.0 nm , this difference is 0.1 ev @xcite .",
