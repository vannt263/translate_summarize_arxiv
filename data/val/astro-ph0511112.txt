    "the nature of ulxs continues to be an enigma , since their adopted isotropic high energy output surpasses the eddington limit of even the most massive stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) , sometimes by large factors .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the high luminosities of ulxs .",
    "the most popular is the `` intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) '' with mass @xmath10 ( e.g. , colbert & mushotzky 1999 , hereafter cm99 ) .",

    "x - ray spectra of ulxs have been described as the emission from optically thick accretion disks ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) . however , the inferred inner disk temperatures in the range of @xmath11 are too high for an ulx accreting at sub - eddington rates .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of ulxs have shown soft x - ray excess emission which has been interpreted as the optically thick emission from thin accretion disks with temperatures in the range of @xmath12,suggesting intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath13 ) accreting at sub - eddington  ( @xmath14 ) rates ( see e.g. , miller , fabian & miller 2004a , b ; miller & colbert 2003 ) . thus ulxs may either be @xmath15 black holes accreting at near or super eddington rates or @xmath16 black holes with sub eddington rates .",
    "one of the first ulxs observed by _ xmm - newton _ to show the soft excess emission that led to the @xmath17 imbh interpretation , is ngc  1313 x-1 ( miller et al . 2003 ) . here",

    "based on the spectral analysis of the available high signal - to - noise pn and mos data and using the improved calibration of the epic instruments , we found that the x - ray spectrum of ngc  1313 x-1 is curved at high energies @xmath55 and shows a soft excess emission below @xmath56 .",
    "this ulx showed spectral softening with increasing flux , similar to that observed from bh xrbs and seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the @xmath57 luminosity of the ulx was @xmath58 in 2000 october 17 with an increase to @xmath59 in 2003 december 21 , assuming a distance of @xmath60 ( tully 1988 ) .",
    "the soft excess and high energy curvature in the x - ray spectra of ngc  1313 x-1 are well described by a model comprising a cool bb ( @xmath61 ) and a pl ( @xmath62 ) with a high energy cutoff , @xmath4 ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the soft excess and power - law , with a high energy cutoff , are characteristic spectral components expected from the accretion disk - corona systems in bh xrbs and agns .",
    "the soft excess is thought to be the optically thick emission from an accretion disk .",
    "the cutoff power - law component arises from thermal comptonization with a cutoff energy characteristic of the temperature of the hot comptonizing corona .",
    "the observed photon index of ngc  1313 x-1 is similar to that of bh xrbs in a low / hard state . in many such bh xrbs and also in seyfert galaxies ,",
    "the cutoff energy is usually observed in the range of @xmath63 ( see e.g. , mcclintock & remillard ( 2004 ) .",
    "if the soft excess and the cutoff power - law emission from ngc  1313 x-1 arise from a disk - corona , then the corona must be extremely cool compared to the coronae of both xrb and agns .",
    "this is a rather puzzling result .",
    "there are also problems with the interpretation of the soft excess emission as the optically thick emission from a thin disk ( see below ) .",
    "the temperature of the cool soft component , parameterized as a blackbody , is @xmath64 kev in all three observations .",
    "the blackbody normalization increased by a factor of @xmath65 from 2000 october 17 to 2003 december 21 .",
    "the cool soft emission was the weakest amongst the three spectral components in the observation of 2000 october 17 , contributing only @xmath66 to the @xmath57 emission .",
    "in the observations of 2003 december 21 and 2004 january 8 , the cool soft component contributed @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , in the @xmath57 band .",
    "miller et al . ( 2003 ) interpreted this component as the optically thick , thermal emission from a cool accretion disk and estimated a black hole mass of @xmath20 for ngc  1313 x-1 .",
    "roberts et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have pointed out a number of problems with the above interpretation , which is based on the extrapolation of the x - ray spectra of xrbs to the imbh regime and the detection of soft x - ray excess emission from ulxs .",
    "it is also assumed that the accretion disks of ulxs extend to the last stable orbit , i.e. , they are in a high state .",
    "this corresponds to the high / soft state of bh xrbs , where the optically thick , thermal emission from the disk completely dominates the @xmath69 spectrum .",
    "this is generally not the case in ulxs , where the cool soft x - ray excess emission only contributes @xmath70 to the total x - ray emission .",
    "the mcd component in bh xrb is associated with a steep power law ( photon index @xmath71 ) ; this is not always the case in ulxs ( see miller et al . 2003 , 2004 ; roberts et al . 2005 ; dewangan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the bb+pl model resulted in a photon index of @xmath72 for ngc  1313 x-1 in the first _ xmm - newton _ observation ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the disk temperature of bh xrbs increases with their luminosity ( see e.g. , miller , fabian & miller 2004 ) , but the temperature of the soft component from ngc  1313 x-1 is remarkably constant in spite of the @xmath73 change in the @xmath57 luminosity .",
    "there is also a definite curvature or cutoff above @xmath74 ( 2000 october ) or @xmath8 ( 2003 december ) in the x - ray spectrum of ngc  1313 x-1 .",
    "this curvature is usually not present in the high state of xrbs : instead , a steep power - law ( @xmath75 ) extending up to several hundred @xmath76 is observed .",
    "grs  1915@xmath77105 and gro  j1655 - 40 are the xrbs that show e - folding cutoffs at @xmath78 in their high state ( mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) , but , unlike ngc  1313 x-1 , their power - law slopes are very steep .       what is the origin of the soft excess component if it is not the thermal emission from a cool accretion disk ?",
    "there are other classes of accreting objects that show similar soft components .",
    "many accreting x - ray pulsars also show soft x - ray excess emission with a blackbody temperature of @xmath79 ( paul et al .",
    "2002 ; hickox et al .",
    "2004 ; neilsen et al .",
    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) and quasars show soft excess emission below @xmath43 that is well described by a blackbody .",
    "the apparent temperature of the soft component , @xmath80 , is similar in a diverse selection of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , czerny et al .",
    "2003 ; gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "this observation can be compared with the similarity of the temperature of the soft component of ngc  1313 x-1 at different luminosities .",
    "the origin of the soft excess emission is not well understood .",
    "king & pounds ( 2003 ) suggest that bhs , accreting at or above the eddington rate , produce winds that are optically thick in continuum .",
    "blackbody emission from these winds may provide the observed soft excess emission from ulxs .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed the galactic micro - quasar grs  1915 + 105 in its `` radio - loud plateau state '' ( martocchia et al .",
    "there is a very striking similarity between grs  1915 + 105 in its plateau state and ngc  1313 x-1 observed on 2000 october .",
    "both show small amplitude variability .",
    "simple absorbed power - law fits to the x - ray spectra of both the objects result is similar photon index ( @xmath81 ) , the residuals show similar deficits above @xmath82 and soft excess emissions around @xmath43 . fig .",
    "[ f1]a is quite similar to figure  5 in martocchia et al .",
    "the above similarity in the x - ray emission of the xrb and the ulx is observed at a factor of @xmath83 difference in luminosities .",
    "thus if the x - ray spectral state is solely driven by accretion rate relative to the eddington rate , the bh mass of ngc  1313 x-1 is likely a factor of @xmath84 higher ( @xmath85 ) than that of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the deficit and the soft excess emission in the spectrum of grs  1915 + 105 have been interpreted as the reprocessing from an ionized disk and reflection from optically thin , disk wind , respectively .",
    "there are minor differences which , if real , may lead to the different interpretation of the x - ray spectra and hence invalidate the direct scaling of their bh masses .",
    "the soft excess emission of grs  1915 + 105 is not well described by a blackbody .",
    "in addition , grs  1915 + 105 shows soft x - ray emission lines as well as iron k@xmath86 line that are not seen in the spectrum of ngc  1313 x-1 .",
    "the ionized disk reflection can not explain the cutoff or deficit above @xmath87 in the 2003 - 12 - 21 spectrum .",
    "the x - ray spectra of ngc  1313 x-1 are also well described by the superposition of a cool bb , a hot mcd and a power - law",
    ". however , the temperature of the mcd component ( @xmath88 on 2000 october ) is too high for a thin standard accretion disk .",
    "this is similar to the `` high temperature '' problem of ulxs observed with _ asca _",
    "( mizuno et al . 1999 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; makishima et al .",
    "one possible explanation is in terms of a thin disk around a kerr bh , since the inner radius of a kerr disk can be @xmath89 times smaller than that of a swarzschild disk , and the temperature of a thin disk varies as @xmath90 , thus resulting in high inner disk temperatures .",
    "ebisawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that kerr models work well for ulxs but the data imply that the disks are highly inclined ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this model can not also explain the soft excess emission below @xmath56 from ngc  1313 x-1 .",
    "another attractive scenario is the slim disk model , in which the disk luminosity can exceed the eddington luminosity by up to a factor of @xmath83 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 , ebisawa et al .",
    "2003 ; kawaguchi 2003 ) .",
    "the slim disk is geometrically thick and can be much hotter than the standard disk .",
    "if this is the case , ngc  1313 x-1 must be radiating at super - eddington rates ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "its bolometric luminosity , @xmath93 estimated using the bb+cutoff pl model for the 2003 december observation , implies a bh mass in the range of @xmath94",
    ". a natural consequence of the slim disk model is that the soft excess emission can be produced in the optically thick winds resulting from the super - critical accretion rates as discussed above ( mukai et al .",
