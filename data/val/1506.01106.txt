    "cloud computing is developed based on various recent advancements in virtualization , grid computing , web computing , utility computing and related technologies .",
    "cloud computing provides both platforms and applications on demand through the internet or intranet @xcite .",
    "some of the key benefits of cloud computing include the hiding and abstraction of complexity , virtualized resources and efficient use of distributed resources . some examples of emerging cloud computing platforms are google app engine @xcite , ibm blue cloud @xcite , amazon ec2 @xcite , and microsoft azure @xcite .",
    "cloud computing allows the sharing , allocation and aggregation of software , computational and storage network resources on demand .",
    "cloud computing is still considered in its infancy as there are many challenging issues to be resolved @xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "@xcite establish a detailed ontology of dissecting cloud into five main layers from top to down : cloud application ( saas ) , cloud software environment ( paas ) , cloud software infrastructure ( iaas ) , software kernel and hardware ( haas ) , and illustrate their interrelations as well as their inter - dependency on preceding technologies .",
    "cloud data center can be a distributed network in structure , which is composed of many computing nodes ( such as servers ) , storage nodes , and network devices .",
    "each node is formed by a series of resources such as cpu , memory , network bandwidth and so on .",
    "each resource has its corresponding properties .",
    "there are many different types of resources for cloud providers . the definition and model defined by this paper",
    "are aimed to be general enough to be used by a variety of cloud providers . in this paper , we focus on infrastructure as a service ( iaas ) in cloud data centers .    in a traditional data center ,",
    "applications are tied to specific physical servers that are often over - provisioned to deal with workload surges and unexpected failures @xcite .",
    "such configuration rigidity makes data centers expensive to maintain with wasted energy and floor space , low resource utilizations and significant management overheads . with virtualization technology ,",
    "today s cloud data centers become more flexible , secure and on - demand allocating .",
    "one key technology plays an important role in cloud data center is resource scheduling .",
    "one of the challenging scheduling problems in cloud data center is to consider allocation and migration of reconfigurable virtual machines and integrated features of hosting physical machines .",
    "it is extremely difficult to research widely for all these problems in real platforms because the application developers ca nt control and process network environment .",
    "what is more , the network conditions can not be predicted or controlled .",
    "the research of dynamic and large - scale distributed environment can be achieved by building data center simulation system , which supports visualized modeling and simulation in large - scale applications in cloud infrastructure .",
    "data center simulation system can describe the application workload statement , which includes user information , data center position , the amount of users and data centers , and the amount of resources in each data center . using this information , data center simulation system generates requests and allocates these requests to virtual machines .    by using data center simulation system , application developers can evaluate suitable strategies such as distributing reasonable data center resources , selecting data center to match special requirements , improving resource utilization and load balancing , reducing total energy - consumptions , reducing costs and so on .",
    "we will look at some closely related work firstly .",

    "cloud simulators can be divided into various categories according to their features . in this section",
    ", we will give a brief comparison with different categories by extending the comparison category in [ 9 ] .",
    "the open - source simulators are selected because we can study their source codes in details , develop new algorithms and improve them if necessary .",
    "the four open source simulators , namely cloudsim , icancloud , greencloud , cloudsched , are representative of many related simulators because we study the architecture design , modeling elements , simulation process , performance metrics and scalability .",
    "these simulators have common features such as in architecture , modeling elements , simulation process as well as their own characteristics such as focusing on different service layers and with different performance metrics .",
    "cloudsim is well known simulator for cloud computing , it can be extended easily but currently it does not consider parallel experiments or lifecycles of vms .",
    "the icancloud implements parallel experiments but does not consider energy consumption or vm migration .",
    "greencloud models detailed energy consumptions for different physical components .",
    "cloudsched can model lifecycle of requests , and provide different metrics for load - balance , energy efficiency and utilization etc .",
    "four open source cloud data centers simulators ( cloudsim , greencloud , icancloud , cloudsched ) are compared together in table 1 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "in this section , we will discuss the performance comparison of icancloud and cloudsim , cloudsched and cloudsched with a focus on the scalability .",
    "we also compare the typical outputs of all compared simulators .        in the comparison between icancloud and cloudsim , jobs in cloudsim",
    "are modeled by configuring input size , processing length and output size .",
    "the jobs in the simulation experiments have 5 mb input size , 30 mb output size , 1,200,000 mi processing length .",
    "in addition , jobs would take advantage of all the available cpu capacity on vms and the vms they used are 9,500 mips .",
    "of course , a new application model is developed in icancloud to execute the same functionality as cloudsim .",
    "the experimental environment is on a computer with a cpu core i3 and 4 gb of ram memory .",
    "6(a ) demonstrates the execution time comparison of cloudsim and icancloud , the x - axis presents the number of jobs executed in each experiment , y - axis presents the vms number and its type , and z - axis presents the time required to execute each experiment ( measured in seconds ) in log - scale .",
    "it s obvious that both simulators need more execution time when increasing the number of jobs , while these simulators would have different impact when increasing the vms number .",
    "when the vms number is more than 2500 , the execution time keeps stable in icancloud , while the execution time is influenced directly by both vms number and jobs number . in most experimental cases with jobs",
    "amount less or equal to 50000 , icancloud is faster than cloudsim , and in all tests with 250k jobs , icancloud is faster . under all tests , icancloud shows better performance in execution time than cloudsim .",
    "6(b ) presents the memory consumption comparison in each experiment for cloudsim and icancloud .",
    "it can be noticed in this graph that icancloud requires more memory than cloudsim .",
    "up to 1000 vms , the amount of memory required by both simulators is similar .",
    "when using more than 1000 vms , the amount of memory required by icancloud goes up much faster than cloudsim .    in general , icancloud is faster in large scale experiments and provides better scalability , but requires more memory than cloudsim .",
    "[ htp ! ]        in the comparison between cloudsim and cloudsched , the comparison is a bit complex than the comparison in section 7.1 , a new construct method is created with start - time and end - time parameters , which refers to the lifecycle of a request .",
    "the file size of request represents the required capacity of all requests .",
    "the start - time , end - time generation approaches are same , servers ( named vms in cloudsim ) and requests ( named cloudlet in cloudsim ) both adopt the ec2 specifications .",
    "list scheduling algorithm is implemented in both simulators , in which requests would be allocated to a pm with the lowest utilization . the experimental environment is based on a dell computer with a cpu core i5 and 8 gb of ram memory .",
    "[ htp ! ]      fig .",
    "7(a ) illustrates the time consumption of each experiment , where x - axis shows the requests number in each experiment for cloudsim and cloudsched , y - axis shows the number of pms and simulators they belong to , and z - axis shows the time required in millisecond unit to simulate each experiment .",
    "it is also apparently observed that larger number of requests and number of pms need more time in both simulators . when the number of vms is less than 10,000 , cloudsched always costs less time to complete simulation . as for the numbers of vms",
    "are 50,000 and 25,000 , cloudsched takes less time than cloudsim , while cloudsched takes longer time when the number of pms is more than 5,000 . as the ratio of the number of vms to the number of pms increases , like 500,000 : 500",
    ", cloudsim shows its strength .",
    "note that the ratio of vms to pms may be varying from a few to a few tens in a real cloud data center .",
    "7(b ) shows the memory consumption comparison of each simulation in cloudsim and cloudsched . in cases when the vms number is relative small , like from 1,000 to 10,000 .",
    "cloudsched needs a little more memory , several megabytes , to execute simulations .",
    "while as the requests number becomes larger , cloudsched costs much less memory than cloudsim , the large difference happens when the request number is 500,000 .",
    "the reason is that the vm and pm model in cloudsched is simpler than the models in cloudsim .    in general ,",
    "cloudsched costs less time when the ratio of the number of vm requests to the number of pms is not too large ( like below 100 ) and costs much less memory than cloudsim .",
    "[ htp ! ]    in fig .",
    "8 , we compare the performance of four energy - conscious resource management strategies against a benchmark technique npa ( nonpoweraware ) . in the benchmark technique",
    ", the processors can be operated at higher possible processing capacity as 100% and do not consider energy - optimization during provisioning of vms to hosts .",
    "the first energy - conscious strategy for comparison is dvfs enabled , which means that the vms are resized during the simulation based on the dynamics of cpu utilization of the host .",
    "the other strategies are extensions of dvfs policy : mu ( minimum utilization ) strategy allocates vms on the minimal utilization nodes ; rs ( random selection ) strategy randomly allocates vms to hosts ; mc ( maximum correlation ) strategy allocates vms on the maximal correlation hosts .",
    "all these extensive strategies enable the idle nodes into sleep mode to save total energy and live migration of vms every 5s for adapting to the allocation .",
    "vms can be migrated to another host , if this operation will reduce energy consumption . in our simulation , the requests come randomly and we vary the number of hosts and vms to obtain data for the energy consumption and the number of migrations . from our simulations ,",
    "mc strategy shows the best energy - efficient effects as shown in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) . as for the number of migrations , npa and dvfs both",
    "have no migrations , while in other three strategies , mc strategy takes least number of migration in most cases .",
    "the data shown in figure 8 is the average of 5 times of repeated simulation .",
    "[ htp ! ]    in fig.9 with greencloud simulations , we collect the total energy consumption under variable data center load ( varying from 0.0 , 0.3 , 0.6 to 1.0 ) and variable number of servers ( varying from 100 to 400 ) both for dvfs only and dns+dvfs power management schemes .",
    "the x - axis formats like ( 100 , 0.0 ) represents the tests with 100 servers and 0.0 load , and ( 400 , 1.0 ) shows tests with 400 servers and 1.0 load . in our simulations , we set the type of workloads as hpc ( high performance computation ) and the results gathered are averaged over 5 runs with the random number generator . from the bar chart , generally , it s obvious that the total energy consumption increases as the number of servers increases .",
    "it also demonstrates that the dvfs scheme shows itself little sensitive to the input load of servers , while by contrast the dns+dvfs scheme shows precise sensitive to variable load .",
    "we also observe that under same number of servers and identical loads , the dns+dvfs scheme saves more energy than dvfs scheme .",
    "[ htp ! ]    in icancloud , fig .",
    "10 illustrates the results gathered by executing the model of phobos application along with the results of the same application implemented on icancloud .",
    "the figure represents the c / p metric for the experiments , where the small instance type recommended by amazon ec2 is provided , and the vms number and tracing intervals are varied . from the results , we can notice that in some cases , using the same size for the interval ( in years ) and increasing the vms number , causes an upward trend in the c / p metric .",
    "then , increasing the vms number provides the same execution time , which contributes to a increasing of the cost for this configuration . besides that",
    ", the mathematical model does not represent the time spent on performing i / o operations .",
    "because that there are still some problems for installation of current release of icancloud , we can not test more data but using results in its original publication .",
    "[ htp ! ]    in cloudsched , fig .",
    "11 shows average imbalance level of a cloud data center and five different scheduling algorithms for load balancing are compared .",
    "zhcj algorithm introduced in @xcite , zhjz algorithm @xcite , lif algorithm @xcite , rand algorithm , and round - robin ( round ) are compared . in these simulations ,",
    "different requests are generated as follows : the total numbers of arrivals ( requests ) can be randomly set ; all requests follow poisson arrival process and have exponential length distribution ; the maximum length of requests can be set ; for each set of inputs ( requests ) , simulations are run six times and all the results shown in this paper are the average of the six runs . in these simulations , the number of pms is fixed as 100 , the number of requests is varying from 250 to 1500 , and a pc with 2 ghz cpu , 2 gb memory is used for all simulations . from these simulations , we observe that lif algorithm outwits other four algorithms with average imbalance values , which shows that lif has a better load balance effects than others .",
    "in this paper , we mainly compare four open source simulators , namely cloudsim , greencloud , icancloud and cloudsched .",
    "these simulators can simulate the cloud data center scenarios from different layers in the cloud computing architecture . from their architectures , elements modeling , simulation process , performance metrics and outputs , we provide detailed comparisons about these simulators .",
    "considering the complexity of networks and the difficult to control the network traffics , simulators are crucial tools for research .",
    "we can see that none of them is perfect for all aspects and there are still much work to do to improve .",
    "one suggestion is to use different tools or their combinations for different optimization objectives such as load balance and energy - efficiency . for future work",
    ", there are still quite a few challenging issues for cloud simulating :    * * modeling different cloud layers*. as we compared in the paper , each tool may focus on one layer .",
    "currently there is still lack of tools that can model all cloud layers ( iaas , paas and saas ) . * * high extensibility*. when new policies and algorithms are added , modular design of the simulators can assure that new modules can be easily added , currently the four simulators still need improving this . * * easy to use and repeatable*. the simulators should enable users to set up simulation easily and quickly with easy to use graphical user interfaces and outputs .",
    "it can accept inputs from text files and output to text files ; can save simulation inputs and outputs so that modelers can repeat experiments , ensuring that repeated simulation yield identical results .",
    "* * considering user priority*. this is a real requirement .",
    "currently the four simulators do not consider this yet .",
    "different priority policies can be created for users to have different priorities for certain types of vms , so that more realistic scenarios can be considered . * * supporting multiple or federated data centers*. the simulator should be able to reflect and model the multiple or federated data centers in real world .",
    "cloudanalyst provides a framework by extending cloudsim and there is still much work to improve .",
