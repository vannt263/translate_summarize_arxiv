    "-5 mm    many problems in biology , chemistry and material science can be formulated as the study of the energy or free energy landscape of the underlying system .",
    "well - known examples of such problems include the conformational changes of macromolecules , chemical reactions and nucleation in condensed systems .",
    "very often the dimension of the state space is very large , and the energy landscape exhibits a hierarchy of structures and scales .",
    "these problems are becoming a major challenge in their respective scientific disciplines and are beginning to receive attention from the mathematics community . in this article , we report recent work in this direction . for a detailed account , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we begin with a simple example .",
    "plotted in figure 1 is the solution of the stochastic differential equation @xmath0 where the potential @xmath1 and @xmath2 is gaussian white noise , @xmath3 . without the random perturbation ,",
    "the solution would be @xmath4 .",
    "indeed the deterministic part of dynamics in does nothing but taking the system to local equilibrium states . with the random perturbation ,",
    "the solution , over long time , exhibits completely different behavior .",
    "it fluctuates around the two local minima of @xmath5 and 1 , with sudden transitions between these two states .",
    "the time scale of the transition , @xmath6 is much larger than the time scale of the fluctuation around the local minima , @xmath7 . for this reason",
    ", we refer to @xmath8 and 1 as the metastable states .",
    "time series of the solution to the stochastic differential equation ( 1.1 ) , with @xmath9 .",
    "obviously the transition between the metastable states is of more interest than the local fluctuation around them .",
    "the transition time is much larger since it requires the system to overcome the energy barrier between the two states .",
    "this is only possible because of the noise .",
    "when @xmath10 is small , a huge noise term is required to accomplish this .",
    "for this reason , such events are very rare , and this is the origin of the disparity between the time scales @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this simple example illustrates one of the major difficulties in modeling such systems , namely the disparity of the time scales .",
    "it does not , however , illustrate the other major difficulty , namely , the large dimension of the state space and the complexity of the energy landscapes .",
    "indeed for typical systems of interests the energy landscape can be very complex .",
    "there can be a huge number of local minima in the state space .",
    "the usual concept of hopping over barriers via saddle points may not apply ( see @xcite ) .    in applications ,",
    "the noise comes typically from thermal noise . in this case",
    ", we should note that even though the potential energy landscapes might be rough and contain small scale features , the system itself experiences a much smoother landscape , the free energy landscape , since some of the small scale features on the potential energy landscape are smoothed out by the thermal noise .",
    "our objective in modeling such systems are the following :    1 .   find the transition mechanism between the metastable states .",
    "2 .   find the transition rates .",
    "3 .   reduce the original dynamics to the dynamics of a markov chain on the metastable states .",
    "our discussion will be centered around the following model problems : @xmath11 or @xmath12 @xmath10 is related to the temperature of the system by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we refer to as type - i gradient flow and as type - ii gradient flow .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us remark that there is a very well - developed theory , the large - deviation theory , or the wentzell - freidlin theory @xcite , that deals precisely with questions of the type that we discussed above .",
    "however as was explained in @xcite , this theory is not best suited for numerical purpose .",
    "therefore we will seek an alternative theoretical framework that is more useful for numerical computations .",
    "-5 mm    transition state theory ( tst ) @xcite has been the classical framework for addressing the questions we are interested in .",
    "it assumes the existence and explicit knowledge of a reaction coordinate , denoted by @xmath15 , that connects the two metastable states .",
    "in addition it assumes that along the reaction coordinate there exists a well - defined transition state , which is typically the saddle point configuration , say at @xmath16 , and the two regions @xmath17 and @xmath18 defines the two metastable regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for these reasons ,",
    "transition state theory is restricted to cases when the system is simple and the energy landscape is smooth , i.e. the energy barriers are larger than the thermal energy @xmath21 .    knowing the transition state",
    ", tst calculates the transition rates by placing particles at the transition state , and measuring the flux that goes into the two regions .",
    "for example , the transition rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is given approximately by @xmath22 where @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the surface delta function at @xmath16 , @xmath25 is the heaviside function , @xmath26 is the lebesgue measure restricted to @xmath19 . for a system with a single particle of mass @xmath27 and potential @xmath28",
    ", this gives @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy barrier at the transition state , @xmath31 , @xmath32 denotes the location of the local minimum inside @xmath19 .",
    "formulas such as are the origin of the arrhenius law for chemical reaction rates and boltzmann factor for hopping rates in kinetic monte carlo models .",
    "-5 mm    for simplicity , we will discuss mainly type - i gradient flows .",
    "the fokker - planck equation can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the equilibrium distribution @xmath35 @xmath36 is the normalization constant @xmath37 .",
    "the states of the markov chain consist of the sets @xmath38 , where @xmath38 satisfies    1 .",
    "the @xmath39 s are mutually disjoint 2 .",
    "@xmath40    where @xmath41 .",
    "an illustration of the collection the @xmath38 is given in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath42 depends on @xmath43 .",
    "as @xmath43 decreases , the @xmath39 s exhibits a hierarchical structure .",
    "illustration of the collection of metastable sets @xmath42 at different energies .",
    "having defined the states of the markov chain , we next compute the transition rates between neighboring states .",
    "denote by @xmath19 and @xmath20 two such neighboring states .",
    "we would like to compute the transition rate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the metastable region containing @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , and let @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . applying laplace s method to ( 3.1 )",
    "we get @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 is a so - called minimal energy path , to be defined below , @xmath52 is the family of hyperplanes normal to @xmath53 .",
    "the minimal energy path ( mep ) is defined as follows . if @xmath28 is smooth",
    ", then @xmath53 is a mep if @xmath54 for all @xmath55 $ ] , i.e. @xmath56 restricted to @xmath53 is parallel to @xmath53 . in general",
    "there is not a unique @xmath53 that is particularly significant , but rather a collection ( a tube or several tubes ) of paths contribute to the transition rates .",
    "however , one can define a mep self - consistently via the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 . in the case when @xmath28 has two scales : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is smooth , then @xmath53 can be defined as the mep of @xmath61 .    for type - i gradient systems , if the two metastable sets are separated by a single saddle point , then the mep is the unstable manifold associated with the saddle point .",
    "mep for type - ii gradient systems is less trivial . in this case",
    "( 3.3)-(3.6 ) have to be modified @xcite .",
    "consider the simple example @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "it has two local equilibrium states @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the mep that connects @xmath19 and @xmath20 is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "it is not a smooth curve .",
    "the velocity is reversed at the saddle point . to verify that the mep does reflect the true behavior of the transition path",
    ", we also plot the transition path obtained from direct simulation of the stochastic differential equation .",
    "mep for type - ii gradient systems .",
    "the red line is the mep in phase space , the green line is the transition path computed from solving the stochastic differential equation .",
    "mep is a very important concept since it defines the `` most probable '' transition path from which transition rates can be computed via equation .",
    "however we should emphasize that from a numerical point of view our task is not that of a conventional optimization or control problem , since there is not an objective function that we can easily work with .",
    "instead our aim is to perform importance sampling in path space to sample the paths that contribute significantly to the switching .",
    "finally , if there exists a mep that connects two metastable sets without going through a third one , then we connect these two metastable sets by a link . in this way",
    ", we form a graph .",
    "the original dynamics is then reduced to a markov chain on this graph .",
    "-5 mm    a variety of numerical techniques have been developed , most prominently in chemistry , but also in biology and material science , for computing meps and sometimes transition rates . among the most well - known techniques in the chemistry literature",
    "are the nudged elastic band method and the transition path sampling technique .",
    "the nudged elastic band method ( neb ) @xcite aims at computing the mep defined by ( 3.5 ) .",
    "it represents the mep by a discrete chain of states .",
    "these states evolve according to the potential forces of the system .",
    "to prevent the states from all falling to the two local equilibrium states , a spring force is applied to neighboring states to penalize the non - uniformity in the distribution of the states along the chain .",
    "this by itself may cause convergence to a path which is not a mep .",
    "hence a nudging technique is used , namely only the normal component of the potential force and the tangential component of the spring force is applied .",
    "neb is a very effective method for small systems with relatively smooth energy landscapes .",
    "it has two main drawbacks .",
    "one is that it is highly inefficient and may not even be applicable to systems with rough energy landscapes .",
    "the other is the choice of the elastic constant .",
    "a large elastic constant requires a small time step in the evolution of the states .",
    "a small elastic constant will not achieve the desired uniformity of the states and hence will not give the required accuracy for the energy barrier .",
    "a second important technique is transition path sampling ( tps ) @xcite .",
    "this method aims at complex systems with rough energy landscapes by developing a monte carlo technique that samples the path space .",
    "its efficiency hinges on the ability to produce new accepted paths from old ones .",
    "other techniques include the ridge method , blue mooth sampling , etc . @xcite .",
    "often these methods require knowing beforehand the reaction coordinate .",
    "al propose to minimize the onsager - machlup action as a way of finding the most probable path for macromolecular systems @xcite .",
    "the onsager - machlup action is the same as the wentzell - freidlin action . from a numerical point of view",
    ", there are certain difficulties associated with minimizing this action functional .",
    "these issues are discussed in @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    the basic idea in the string method , developed in @xcite , is to represent transition paths by their intrinsic parameterization in order to efficiently evolve and sample paths in path space .",
    "it has two versions .",
    "the zero temperature version is designed for smooth energy landscapes .",
    "the finite temperature version is designed for rough energy landscapes in which case thermal noise acts to smooth out the small scale features .",
    "the simplest example of a zero - temperature string method is to evolve curves in path space by the gradient flow @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the tangent vector of the curve @xmath68 , @xmath69 denotes the component of @xmath56 normal to @xmath67 , @xmath70 is the lagrange multiplier that enforces certain specific parameterization of the curves .",
    "for example if we require equal arclength parameterization , then we need @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 we call such curves with intrinsic parameterization strings .    in practice",
    "the strings are discretized into a collection of points .",
    "these points move according to the normal component of the potential force .",
    "a reparameterization step is applied once in a while to enforce the proper parameterization of the strings .",
    "the finite temperature string method is designed for systems with rough energy landscapes , particularly the case when the potential can be expressed in the form @xmath73 where @xmath61 is smooth and @xmath74 . in this case",
    "we would like to compute the mep of @xmath61 without first computing @xmath61 explicitly .",
    "this is achieved by creating an ensemble of a special type .",
    "our computational object will be a string connecting the two metastable sets , together with a family of probability measures on the hyperplanes normal to the string .",
    "consider the stochastic equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is gaussian noise with mean 0 and correlation @xmath77 the projection operator @xmath78 is defined by projecting to the hyperplane normal to the string @xmath79 , where @xmath80 @xmath81 is the tangent vector of @xmath53 at @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the lagrange multiplier that enforces proper parameterization of @xmath53 .    *",
    "theorem 1.1 . *",
    "_ _    1 .   the statistical steady state of satisfies : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the hyperplane normal to @xmath53 at @xmath82 , @xmath58 .",
    "the stationary distribution of is given by the family of distributions @xmath86    knowing @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the transition rates and free energy landscapes can be computed , see @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature string method is applied to the perturbed mueller potential @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the so - called mueller potential ( see @xcite ) , @xmath91 is a random perturbation .",
    "the results of the ( finite temperature ) string method is shown in figure 4 .",
    "also plotted is the mep of @xmath92 ( since @xmath93 is explicitly known for this particular example ) as well as the fluctuations around @xmath53 .",
    "effective mep and local fluctuations for the perturbed mueller potential .",
    "the red curve is the mep for @xmath94 .",
    "the black curve is the mep computed from the finite temperature string method .",
    "the green curves show the size of the fluctuations .",
    "-5 mm    there are several important topics that we did not cover in this brief report .",
    "these include the effect of dynamics , non - gradient systems , and acceleration techniques .",
    "these are discussed in @xcite . also found in these references",
    "are applications of the ideas discussed here to thermal activated reversal of magnetic thin films , models of martensitic transformations , and the formation of @xmath95 from 60 carbon atoms .",
    "the last example is a case when the barrier is entropic . even though the potential energy is mainly going downhill , the free energy has barriers because of entropic effects .",
    "such examples are found frequently in biopolymers .    from a numerical point of view , our main idea for overcoming the difficulty caused by the disparity of the times scales is to reformulate the problem as a boundary value problem instead of initial value problem , since we have some knowledge of the initial and final state of the system .",
    "compared with other existing methods that assume explicit knowledge of a reaction coordinate , our method finds the reaction coordinate self - consistently during the computation .",
    "the topic discussed here is relatively new in applied mathematics , but it is of paramount importance in science and particularly computational science .",
