    "the definition of a quantum field theory generally begins with a classical field theory with bare action @xmath0 , which is then quantized by defining a functional integral . even if @xmath0 is scale- or ( in curved spacetime ) weyl  invariant , the resulting quantum effective action in general is not , because in the definition of the functional integral one necessarily introduces a mass scale .",
    "this is the origin of the celebrated trace anomaly @xcite .",
    "it has been known since early on that when a dilaton is present , there is a way of perturbatively quantizing the theory which preserves weyl invariance @xcite .",
    "this has been rediscovered several times in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss mainly the implications of this type of quantization procedure for the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "actually , we will adopt a point of view that puts the rg first , and views the quantum effective action as the result of following the rg flow all the way to the ir .",
    "we will use a nonperturbative , `` wilsonian '' definition of the rg which is seen as the dependence of the effective action on a cutoff that is introduced by hand in the definition of the functional integral . by using this definiton",
    ", we can extend the validity of the preceding statement to any theory , independent of its renormalizability properties .",
    "the discussion will be pedagogical and self  contained . in the second section we discuss scale and weyl invariance , and the notion of weyl geometry .",
    "we recall that when a dilaton is present , one can make any action weyl invariant by replacing all dimensionful couplings by dimensionless couplings multiplied by powers of the dilaton .",
    "this is a gravitational version of the `` stckelberg trick '' . in the subsequent sections we show , in increasingly complicated cases , that weyl invariance can be preserved in the quantum theory .",
    "we begin with massless , free matter fields conformally coupled to a background metric and dilaton . since in this case the functional integral is gaussian , one can prove directly that the effective action is weyl  invariant . in order to extend this statement to more complicated , interacting theories",
    ", it turns out to be better to view the effective action as the ir endpoint of a wilsonian rg flow .",
    "one can then show quite generally that there exists a way of constructing the rg flow which preserves weyl  invariance , so if the initial point of the flow ( in the uv ) is weyl  invariant , also the ir endpoint will be .",
    "for clarity we present this logic first in the case of free massless fields , confirming the result obtained from direct evaluation of the effective action . in these cases",
    "one can actually construct explicit one  parameter families of weyl  invariant actions that interpolate continuously between the bare action in the uv and the effective action in the ir .",
    "the construction is complete in 2 dimensions , where the effective action is ( the weyl  invariant version of ) the polyakov action , and limited to the first terms in a curvature expansion in 4 dimensions .",
    "we then observe that the condition of masslessness can be easily relaxed , since a mass can be viewed as a coupling of the field to the dilaton .",
    "since any dimensionful coupling can be traded for a dimensionless coupling times some power of the dilaton , the proof can be extended to the case of interacting matter coupled to a background metric and dilaton and finally to the case when gravity itself is quantized , by which we mean that gravitons and dilatons are allowed to circulate in the loops . in this way",
    "one has a fully nonperturbative proof that there exists a weyl  invariant definition of the effective action .",
    "normal physical theories are neither conformal nor scale  invariant .",
    "the renormalization group running describes the dependence of couplings on one dimensionful scale and the theory becomes conformally invariant only at a fixed point .",
    "if we now reformulate an arbitrary theory in a weyl  invariant way , several obvious questions arise : what is the meaning of a cutoff in a weyl  invariant theory ? what distinguishes a fixed point from any other point ?",
    "are these weyl  invariant quantum theories physically equivalent to ordinary non  weyl  invariant ones ?",
    "we will address these questions in the course of our derivations and summarize the state of our understanding in the conclusions .",
    "a global scale transformation is a rescaling of all lengths by a fixed , constant factor @xmath1 . in",
    "flat space , scale transformations are usually interpreted as the map @xmath2 . as such , they form a particular subgroup of diffeomorphisms . alternatively",
    ", one can think of rescaling the metric @xmath3 .",
    "the two points of view are completely equivalent , since lengths are given by integrating the line element @xmath4 .",
    "for our purposes it will be convenient to adopt the second point of view .",
    "let us now define the scaling dimension of a quantity .",
    "consider a theory with fields @xmath5 , parameters @xmath6 ( which include masses , couplings , wave function renormalizations etc . ) and action @xmath7 .",
    "there is a unique choice of numbers @xmath8 ( one per field ) and @xmath9 ( one per parameter ) such that @xmath0 is invariant : [ weylinv ] s(g_,_a , g_i)=s(^2 g_,^w_a_a,^w_ig_i )  .",
    "( it does not matter here whether the metric is fixed or dynamical . )",
    "the numbers @xmath8 , @xmath9 are called the scaling dimensions , or the weights , of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the spacetime coordinates are dimensionless and we use natural units where @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "then , the scaling dimensions are equal to the ordinary length dimensions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the sense of dimensional analysis . since in particle physics it is customary to use mass dimensions , when we talk of `` dimensions '' without further specification we will refer to the mass dimensions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions , the dimensions of scalar , spinor and vector fields are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "one can easily convince oneself that the dimensions of all parameters in the lagrangian , such as masses and couplings , are the same as in the more familiar case when coordinates have dimension of length .",
    "changing couplings is usually interpreted as changing theory , so in general the transformations are not symmetries of a theory but rather maps from one theory to another . in the case",
    "when all the @xmath9 are equal to zero , we have [ scaleinv ] s(g_,_a , g_i)=s(^2 g_,^w_a_a , g_i )  .",
    "since these are transformations that map a theory to itself , a theory of this type is said to be globally scale invariant .",
    "scale transformations with @xmath1 a positive real function of @xmath18 are called weyl transformations .",
    "they act on the metric and the fields exactly as in . what about the parameters ? they are supposed to be @xmath18-independent , so transformation @xmath19 would not make much sense .",
    "one can overcome this difficulty by promoting the dimensionful parameters to fields .",
    "one can then meaningfully ask whether holds . in general the answer will be negative , but there is a simple procedure that allows one to make a scale invariant theory also weyl  invariant : it is called weyl gauging and it was the earliest incarnation of the notion of gauge theory . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a special case of weyl gauging , namely the case when the connection is flat .",
    "we pick a mass parameter of the theory , let s call it @xmath20 and we promote it to a function that we shall denote @xmath21 .",
    "we can write [ sigma ] ( x)=e^(x )  , where @xmath20 is constant .",
    "the function @xmath21 , or sometimes @xmath22 , is called the dilaton .",
    "notice that unlike an ordinary scalar field , it has dimension one independently of the spacetime dimensionality .",
    "thus it transforms under weyl transformation as @xmath23 .",
    "now we can take any other dimensionful coupling of the theory and write [ dimlesscouplings ] g_i=^-w_ig_i=^d_ig_i  , where @xmath24 is dimensionless ( and therefore weyl  invariant ) . in general , a caret over a symbol denotes the same quantity measured in units of the dilaton . in principle one could promote more than one dimensionful parameter , or even all dimensionful parameters , to independent dilatons .",
    "this may have interesting applications , but for the sake of simplicity in this paper we shall restrict ourselves to the case when there is a single dilaton .    with the dilaton",
    "we construct a pure - gauge abelian gauge field @xmath25 , transforming under as @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the covariant derivative with respect to the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath28 . define a new ( non - metric ) connection [ hatgamma ] _ ^_= _ ^_-^_b_-^_b_+g_b^  , where @xmath29 are the christoffel symbols of @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding covariant derivative is denoted @xmath30 .",

    "we see that the weigth ( or the dimension ) acts like the weyl charge of the field .",
    "the tensor @xmath34 is covariant under diffeomorphisms and under weyl transformations .",
    "the curvature of @xmath35 is defined by v^=_^_v^  .",
    "the tensor @xmath36 is weyl invariant , and raising and lowering indices one obtains weyl covariant expressions of different dimensions .",

    "it is also possible to define the tensor @xmath37 which is related to @xmath38 by the same formula that relates @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and therefore reduces to the standard weyl tensor in a gauge where @xmath21 is constant",

    "express every parameter @xmath6 as in .",
    "replace all covariant derivatives @xmath41 by weyl covariant derivatives @xmath35 and all curvatures @xmath42 by the weyl covariant curvatures @xmath43 .",
    "now all the terms appearing in the action are products of weyl covariant objects , and local weyl invariance just follows from the fact that the action is dimensionless . in this way we have defined an action @xmath44 .",
    "it contains only dimensionless couplings @xmath24 , and is weyl invariant by construction .",
    "one can choose a gauge where @xmath45 is constant ( equivalently , @xmath46 ) , and in this gauge the action @xmath44 reduces to the original one .",
    "the above construction defines an `` integrable weyl geometry '' , since the curvature of the weyl gauge field @xmath47 is zero . in this integrable case",
    "there is also another way of defining a weyl  invariant action from a non  invariant one , namely to replace all the arguments in @xmath0 by the corresponding dimensionless quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 and subsequently reexpress the action in terms of the original fields s(g_,,_a , g_i)= s(g_,_a , g_i )  .",
    "it is easy to see that this construction gives the same result as the preceding one .",
    "this follows from the fact that are the christoffel symbols of @xmath51 , that @xmath52 and that the curvature tensor of @xmath31 is @xmath53 .",

    "the above procedure can be used to rewrite any theory in weyl ",
    "invariant form .",
    "not all weyl  invariant theories are of this type : there are also theories that are weyl  invariant without containing a weyl gauge field @xmath47 ( or a dilaton ) . in such theories",
    "the terms generated by a weyl transformation that contain the derivatives of the transformation parameter are compensated by terms generated by variations of ricci tensors . since weyl",
    " invariance can be viewed as a gauged version of global scale invariance , this has been called `` ricci gauging '' in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that such ricci  gauged theories correspond ( under mild additional assumptions ) to theories that are conformal ",
    "invariant , as opposed to merely scale  invariant , in flat space .",
    "the existence of well  behaved theories that are scale but not conformal  invariant in flat space has been reexamined recently @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the evaluation of the effective action for free , massless matter fields conformally coupled to a metric .",
    "this will provide the basis for different quantization procedures to be described in the following .",
    "much of the discussion can be carried out in arbitrary even dimension @xmath14 .",
    "for definiteness let us consider first a single conformally coupled scalar field , with equation of motion @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "functional integration over @xmath58 in the presence of a source @xmath59 leads to a generating functional @xmath60 , whose legendre transform @xmath61 is the effective action . for the definition of the functional integral",

    "the kernel @xmath129 is arbitrary , except for the general requirements of being a monotonically decreasing function both in @xmath130 and @xmath126 , tending fast to zero for @xmath131 and to @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "these conditions ensure that the contribution to the functional integral of field modes with momenta @xmath134 are suppressed , while the contribution of field modes with momenta @xmath135 are unaffected .",
    "we define a @xmath126-dependent generating functional @xmath136 by e^-w_k(g_,j)= d(-s(g _ , ) -s_k(g_,)-dx j )  .",
    "the eaa is obtained by legendre transforming , and then subtracting the cutoff : @xmath137 note that since @xmath138 when @xmath139 , the eaa becomes the ordinary effective action in this limit .",
    "the evaluation of the eaa for gaussian matter fields , conformally coupled to a metric , follows the same steps that led to ( [ oneloop ] ) .",
    "the only differences are the replacement of @xmath0 by @xmath140 and hence of the `` inverse propagator '' @xmath141 by the `` cutoff inverse propagator '' @xmath142 , and in the end the subtraction of @xmath143 .",
    "the result is [ eaai1loop ] _",
    "k(g_,)= s(g_,)+ ( )  .",
    "we used here the superscript i to denote that this eaa has been obtained by using the standard measure and reduces to @xmath114 for @xmath144 .",
    "we would like now to define a weyl  invariant form of eaa , to be called @xmath145 in analogy to the effective action @xmath115 discussed previously .",
    "the first step is to clarify the meaning of the cutoff @xmath126 in this context . in the usual treatment , _",
    "i.e. _ in a non  gravitational context , @xmath126 is a constant with dimension of mass . in the present context",
    "these two properties are contradictory .",
    "a quantity that has a nonzero dimension can not generally be a constant : it can only be constant in some special gauge .",
    "this means that the cutoff must be allowed to be a generic non - negative function on spacetime .",
    "now we must give a meaning to the notion that the couplings depend on the cutoff . in a weyl  invariant theory all couplings are dimensionless , and the only way they can depend on @xmath126 is via the dimensionless combination @xmath146 .",
    "note that by definition the dilaton can not vanish anywhere , whereas the cutoff should be allowed to go to zero .",
    "so @xmath147 is a non - negative dimensionless function on spacetime .",
    "this raises the question of the meaning of a running coupling whose argument is itself a function on spacetime . in order to avoid such issues",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath147 is a constant , in other words the cutoff and the dilaton are proportional .",
    "with this point understood , the evaluation of the eaa with the weyl ",
    "invariant measure is very simple : as in section 3.3 we just have to replace @xmath20 by @xmath21 [ eaaii1loop ] _ u(g_,)&= & s(g_,)+ ( ) + & = & s(g_,)+(+u^2 r(u^2 ) )  .",
    "in the second line we have reexpressed the eaa as a function of the weyl  covariant operator @xmath148 , the weyl ",
    "invariant cutoff parameter @xmath147 and the dimensionless function @xmath149 .",
    "it is manifest that all dependence on @xmath126 is via @xmath147 and that @xmath150 is weyl  invariant .      in the preceding section",
    "we have defined the eaa , an effective action that depends continuously on a parameter @xmath126 and reduces to the ordinary effective action for @xmath144 .",

    "one uses the field space metric @xmath155 to raise and lower indices and transform the covariant and contravariant tensors into mixed tensors , each of which can be seen as a function of @xmath141 . in practice",
    "this amounts to canceling all factors of @xmath156 and @xmath20 . ]",
    "we will not give the general proof of this equation but we shall derive it in the special case of free matter coupled to an external gravitational field . before doing this , however , it is convenient to discuss the use of this equation as a tool to calculate the effective action .    the r.h.s . of the frge ( [ erge ] ) can be regarded as the `` beta functional '' of the theory , giving the @xmath126dependence of all the couplings . to see this",
    "let us assume that @xmath157 admits a derivative expansion of the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 are coupling constants and @xmath160 are all possible operators constructed with the field @xmath58 and @xmath161 derivatives , which are compatible with the symmetries of the theory .",
    "we have @xmath162 where @xmath163 are the beta functions of the couplings . here",
    "we have introduced @xmath164 , @xmath165 being an arbitrary initial value . if we expand the trace on the r.h.s . of ( [ erge ] ) in operators @xmath166 and compare with ( [ dtgamma ] ) , we can read off the beta functions of the individual couplings .",
    "the most remarkable property of the frge is that the trace on the r.h.s .",
    "is free of uv and ir divergences .",
    "this is because the derivative of the cutoff kernel goes rapidly to zero for @xmath167 , and @xmath126 also acts effectively as a mass .",
    "so , even though the eaa defined above is as ill  defined as the usual effective action , its @xmath32derivative is well  defined .",
    "given a `` theory space '' which consists of a class of functionals of the fields , one can define on it a flow without having to worry about uv regularizations .",
    "all the beta functions are finite .",
    "this can be done for any theory , whether renormalizable or not .",
    "then , one can pick an initial point in theory space , which can be identified with the bare action at some uv scale @xmath168 , and study the trajectory passing through it in either direction .",
    "the eaa can be obtained by solving the first order differential equation ( [ erge ] ) and taking the limit @xmath139 .",
    "the issue of the divergences presents itself , in this formulation , when one tries to move @xmath168 to higher energies , which is equivalent to solving the rg equation for growing @xmath126 .",
    "if the trajectory is renormalizable , all dimensionless couplings remain finite in the limit @xmath169 .",
    "this implies that only the relevant dimensionful coupling diverge , and one expects only a finite number of these .",
    "the ambiguities that correspond to these divergences are fixed by the choice of rg trajectory , because the ir limit ( i.e. the renormalized couplings ) is kept fixed . on the other hand if some dimensionless coupling diverges ( e.g. at a landau pole ) the theory ceases to make sense there and the trajectory describes an effective low energy field theory .",
    "let us now return to the case of free matter in an external gravitational field . in the preceding section we defined two variants of the eaa : the `` standard '' eaa @xmath170 and the weyl ",
    "invariant eaa @xmath150 , both of which can be written as trace of the logarithm of some function of the kinetic operator .",
    "these expressions are formal , because they contain divergences and need to be regularized . in the case of @xmath150",
    "this can be done in a weyl  invariant way by using an uv cutoff that is a multiple of the dilaton , similar to the way we introduced the infrared cutoff @xmath126 .",
    "we do not pursue this here .",
    "instead , we take the derivative of ( [ eaai1loop ] ) with respect to @xmath126 and using the definition @xmath171 obtain @xmath172 it is easy to see , especially using the form in the first line , that this is a special case of the frge , and the fall  off properties of the function @xmath173 guarantee that the trace on the r.h.s .",

    "so the r.h.s . of and are identical .",
    "the reason for the lack of invariance of the eaa @xmath114 ( and its derivative ) is the measure which contains the absolute mass scale @xmath20 .",
    "if one allowed @xmath20 to be transformed , in the same way as we allow the cutoff @xmath126 to be transformed , the two actions would be seen to be the same . ]",
    "the eaa s @xmath170 and @xmath150 are not well  defined functionals , but their derivatives are well  defined . as explained above , one can integrate the frge and obtain , in the ir limit , the ordinary effective action . if one starts from a given weyl ",

    "it is also interesting to observe that if we think of @xmath150 as a function of @xmath126 , @xmath21 and @xmath211 , and vary each keeping the other two fixed , the metric variation is again given by equation , the @xmath21 variation gives the first term in the r.h.s . of and the @xmath126 variation",

    "the analysis then has to be limited to the first few terms of the expansion in curvatures : _ k = d^4xwhere @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 depend on @xmath126 .",

    "here we are neglecting the local terms , whose coefficients are arbitrary and can be tuned to zero . to connect this result with standard one loop eas computed in @xcite",
    "it is sufficient to change the basis expansion from powers of @xmath219 and their derivatives to powers of @xmath220 and their derivatives .",
    "( this requires expressing the riemann tensor as an infinite nonlocal series in the ricci tensor . )",
    "an ea of the form ( [ ea d=4 k=0 ] ) had been suggested by deser and schwimmer @xcite as the source of the @xmath179anomaly , namely the terms proportional to @xmath221 in .",
    "this action ( in contrast to the riegert action discussed below ) also produces the correct flat spacetime limit for the correlation functions of the energy momentum tensor @xmath222 @xcite .    in the basis of the tensors @xmath220 the terms cubic in curvature",
    "are known explicitly @xcite .",
    "when the riemann squared term in the anomaly is expanded in an infinite series in @xmath220 , the action of @xcite correctly reproduces the first terms of this expansion @xcite . in order to reproduce the full anomaly ( both @xmath179 and @xmath106terms )",
    "one would need also terms in the effective action of order higher than three .",

    "this does not mean , however , that one can not write the full effective action as the sum of the riegert action and weyl  invariant terms , because one can write the deser  schwimmer action as the riegert action ( with @xmath224 ) plus weyl  invariant terms . in this case the energy ",
    "momentum correlator would come from the weyl  invariant terms , as we shall see below .",
    "the relation between the wess ",

    "the latter choice exactly reproduces ; other choices of @xmath107 give the riegert action plus weyl  invariant terms , while gives another form of the anomaly functional .",
    "one can obtain some additional information on the effective action @xmath114 by using these formulae in @xmath231 where the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "invariant by construction and the anomaly comes entirely from the second term .",
    "for example if we use with @xmath230 , the second term exactly reproduces the riegert action and the correlator of two energy ",
    "momentum tensors must come from the first term .",
    "we know already that it must contain the term @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the weyl tensor constructed with the metric @xmath234 . expanding this to second order in the curvature of @xmath211 one reobtains as a leading term the action .",
    "the lack of weyl  invariance of that action is compensated by higher terms in the expansion .",
    "this shows that there is no contradicton between the presence of the riegert and the deser ",
    "schwimmer terms in the effective action @xmath114 , and the flat space limit of energy ",
    "momentum tensor correlators .",

    "in the preceding sections we have shown that there exists a quantization procedure such that the effective action which is obtained by integrating out free ( gaussian ) matter fields remains weyl invariant .",
    "the proof was simple because the integration over matter was gaussian .",
    "here we generalize the result to the case when there are matter interactions .    as in the preceding section ,",
    "we begin by considering the case when the initial matter action is weyl invariant even without invoking a coupling to the dilaton .",
    "this is the case for massless , renormalizable quantum field theories such as @xmath242 , yang - mills theory and fermions with yukawa couplings .",
    "the interactions are of the form @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a dimension @xmath14 operator and @xmath245 is dimensionless .",
    "interactions generate new anomalous terms over and above those that we have already considered for gaussian matter .",

    "the general idea is to begin with some weyl ",
    "invariant bare action at some scale and to integrate the rg flow .",
    "if the `` beta functional '' is itself weyl  invariant , the action at each scale will be weyl  invariant . the effective action , which is obtained by letting @xmath139 , will also be weyl  invariant .",
    "this statement is seemingly in contrast with , which implies that weyl invariance can only be achieved when all beta functions are zero",
    ". how can one maintain weyl  invariance along a flow ?",
    "the trick is to consider the flow as dependence of @xmath245 on the dimensionless parameter @xmath146 .",
    "we assume @xmath147 to be constant to avoid issues related to the interpretation of a coupling depending on a function .",
    "since @xmath147 is weyl  invariant , also @xmath247 is .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of weyl s geometry , where the dilaton is interpreted physically as the unit of mass and @xmath147 is the cutoff measured in the chosen units .",
    "we now see that with this definition of rg , the running of couplings does not in itself break weyl invariance . in the spirit of weyl",
    "s theory the dilaton is taken as a reference scale and the couplings are functions of @xmath147 . since @xmath147 is weyl  invariant , _",
    "s_int=0  , even when the beta function @xmath248 is not zero .",
    "it is important to stress that this should not be interpreted as vanishing trace of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor .",
    "we argued in section 3.4 that the energy ",
    "momentum tensor is the same whether one uses the standard or the weyl ",
    "invariant measure .",
    "that argument is not restricted to non  interacting matter and applies here too .",
    "so , as in the case of free matter fields discussed at the end of the preceding section , the physical content of the weyl ",
    "invariant theory is exactly the same as in the usual formalism .",
    "the recovery of weyl  invariance is due to additional terms that involve the variation of the action with respect to the dilaton .",
    "let us return now to the issue of the weyl  invariance of the flow . the r.h.s . of the frge is given in ( [ erge ] ) as a trace of a function involving the hessian @xmath81 .",
    "as was the case with the determinants of the preceding section , such a trace can only be defined by using a metric in field space .",
    "it is therefore more appropriate , and more convenient , to regard the argument of the trace as a function of the differential operator @xmath82 , related to the hessian as in ( [ raise ] ) .",

    "the new interaction terms are also weyl invariant , and they will modify the operator @xmath82 by terms that are also weyl - covariant . therefore , the r.h.s",
    ". of the frge is again the trace of some function of a weyl - covariant operator , and therefore is again weyl invariant . since the beta functional is weyl  invariant , if we start from some initial condition that is weyl invariant we will remain within the subspace of theories that are weyl  invariant",
    ". the effective action , which is obtained as the limit of the flow for @xmath199 , will also be weyl invariant .",
    "the advantage of the calculation based on the frge is that it extends easily to arbitrary theories .",
    "let us begin by considering the addition of masses , which break weyl invariance at the classical level but remains within the scope of renormalizable theories . applying the stckelberg trick we can convert all mass terms to interactions with the background dilaton , thus reinstating weyl invariance at the classical level .",
    "for example , in the case of a massive scalar field @xmath58 the mass term is written as @xmath249 , for some dimensionless coupling @xmath28 .",
    "this becomes a genuine mass term in the gauge where @xmath45 .",
    "then we can repeat the preceding argument .",
    "the only difference is that now the dilaton will be present in the action from the beginning , whereas if one had started from a weyl  invariant theory , the coupling to the dilaton would only arise in the course of the flow as a consequence of its presence in @xmath250 .",
    "finally , we can relax all constraints on the functional form of the action @xmath7 . using the stckelberg trick ,",
    "as discussed in the end of section 3 , we can construct an action @xmath44 .",
    "because @xmath251 is weyl  invariant , the resulting hessian has well - defined , homogeneous transformation properties and the operator @xmath82 , defined in section 3.3 by using a weyl  invariant metric @xmath84 , is weyl  covariant . the r.h.s . of the frge",
    "is a trace of a function of this operator and therefore is weyl  invariant .",
    "let us suppose that we know the form of the action @xmath0 at some ( constant ) cutoff @xmath252 .",
    "it gives rise , via its flow , to an effective action @xmath253 .",
    "construct the weyl ",
    "invariant starting action @xmath251 and take it as initial point of the flow at cutoff @xmath208 ( which could now be some function of position ) . flowing towards the ir from this starting point",
    "is guaranteed to lead to an effective action @xmath31 that is still weyl invariant .",
    "when @xmath31 is evaluated at constant @xmath45 it agrees with the effective action @xmath253 evaluated in the weyl ",
    "non  invariant flow .",
    "we thus see that _ quantization commutes with the stckelberg trick_.    as mentioned earlier , renormalizability is not required for these arguments , because the frge is uv finite .",
    "divergences manifest themselves when one tries to solve for the flow towards large @xmath126 .",
    "the question whether this theory has a sensible uv limit can be answered by studying the flow for increasing @xmath147 .",
    "if the trajectory tends to an uv fixed point it is called a `` renormalizable '' or `` asymptotically safe '' trajectory .",
    "if instead the trajectory diverges in the uv , it describes an effective field theory with an uv cutoff scale .",
    "we will address in section 7 the meaning of a fixed point in a theory space consisting entirely of weyl  invariant actions .",
    "until now we have considered matter fields coupled to an external gravitational field , which is described either by a metric or by a metric and a dilaton .",
    "we would like to extend our results also to the case when gravity is dynamical .",
    "this means that we have to be able to `` quantize gravity '' .",
    "contrary to what is often stated , there exists a perfectly well defined and workable framework that allows us to compute quantum gravitational effects : it is the framework of effective field theories . by using the background field method",
    ", general relativity reduces to a ( perturbatively nonrenormalizable ) theory of a spin two field propagating on a curved manifold , not unlike the general theories discussed in the previous section . as discussed for example in @xcite ,",
    "the background field method actually guarantees that the theory is `` background independent '' in the sense that no background plays a special role .",
    "this scheme has the limitation that in trying to calculate the effective action one encounters infinitely many divergences , each requiring a physical measurement to fix the value of the corresponding counterterm .",
    "this means that the theory can be adjusted to fit essentially any experimental result and is not predictive . in practice",
    "this is not as bad as it seems . as long as one restricts oneself to experiments at energies below the uv cutoff of the theory , a finite number of loops is sufficient to describe the data with a predefined precision .",
    "thus , only finitely many divergences are encountered and one could test the theory by comparing it to a number of experiments that is greater than the number of divergences .",
    "this logic has been quite successful in our understanding of strong interactions at low energy .",
    "if this is still regarded as too unsatisfactory , one can entertain the possibility that the theory is on a renormalizable trajectory and therefore can be continued to indefinitely large energies .",
    "the advantage of such a situation is that if the attraction basin of the fixed point is finite dimensional , it places infinitely many constraints on experiments at any energy scale , and is therefore highly predictive .",
    "this possibility , however , is not essential for our main result .",
    "the main fact is that standard quantum field theoretic methods can be used to describe a quantum field theory of gravity which is at least an effective field theory with a limited energy domain of applicability and in the most optimistic scenario may hold up to indefinitely high energy and have a finite number of free parameters .      with these motivations",
    "we now consider a generic theory of gravity based on an action @xmath0 which is a diffeomorphism- and weyl  invariant functional of a metric @xmath211 and a dilaton @xmath21 . by the discussion in section 3",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between such functionals and diffeomorphism - invariant functionals of a metric alone .",
    "if there were some matter fields that have already been integrated out , the corresponding effective action need not be considered separately and is included here in the gravitational action .    the metric and dilaton now have to be expanded as the sum of a background and a quantum part .",
    "since in the following we will have to refer to the backgrounds much more often than to the full background plus quantum fields , for typographical simplicity we choose to call @xmath254 and @xmath255 the full quantum fields , @xmath28 and @xmath21 the background fields , @xmath256 and @xmath257 the quantum fields .",
    "thus     for the limited purposes of this paper , quantum gravity means the theory of interacting fields @xmath258 and @xmath257 propagating on the backgrounds @xmath211 and @xmath21 .",
    "the infinitesimal form of diffeomorphism and weyl transformations is _ |g_=&_|g _  ; _",

    "we choose the gauge fixing action s_gf = d^4x z^2 f_^ f _  , where [ gf ] f_=d_h^_-d_h  . here",
    "@xmath262 and @xmath263 are gauge parameters and @xmath264 is a wave function renormalization constant to be specified later . the ghost action corresponding to the gauge is given by s_gh = d^4x ^2|c_g^ ( _ gh)_^c_=  _ gh(|c,_gh c )  . [ gh ] where @xmath265 and @xmath266 are dimensionless anticommuting vector fields , @xmath267 is the weyl invariant inner product on vector fields defined in , and [ gravghost ] ( _ gh)_^= -(_^d^2 + d_d^+_^ ) is the weyl - covariant operator acting on ghosts . to gauge  fix weyl invariance",
    "we impose that @xmath268 , a condition that does not lead to ghosts . with this condition we can simply delete from the hessian the rows and columns that involve the @xmath257 field and",
    "we remain with a hessian that is a quadratic form in the space of the covariant symmetric tensors @xmath258 .    in this space",
    "we choose the weyl  invariant functional metric _",
    "g(h , h)= d^4x^4 h_g^g^h _  . which can be used to turn the hessian into a linear operator @xmath269 acting on the space of covariant symmetric tensors . because the original action was weyl ",
    "invariant , this operator is weyl - covariant , in the sense that @xmath270 likewise the operator is weyl - covariant .",
    "from here there follows that the frge , which is a sum of traces of functions of these operators , is weyl  invariant .",
    "this shows that there exists a quantization scheme which preserves weyl  invariance along the flow , so if one starts from a `` bare '' action which is weyl invariant , the effective action will also be weyl  invariant .    note that if we choose the background gauge such that @xmath45 ( the background gauge being completely independent from the gauge fixing in the functional integral ) one obtains an effective action which is a functional of the background metric only .",
    "this is exactly the same functional that one would have obtained by integrating with the weyl - non - invariant measure where @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath20 and with the action written in the same gauge .",
    "thus , also in the case of dynamical gravity , the choice of the gauge @xmath45 commutes with quantization . by a similar argument",
    "one sees that the stckelberg procedure of weyl - covariantizing an action also commutes with quantization .",
    "the above conclusion is completely general , but in order to illustrate it with a concrete calculation we consider the simple case of gravity with the einstein - hilbert action : [ hilbert ] s(g ) = d^4 x ( 2-r )  , applying the weyl covariantization ( stckelberg ) procedure described in section 3 , this can be rewritten as [ confaction ] s(g,)=d^4 x  , where [ conversion ] = r-6 ^ -1  ; z^2=  ; = g  .    neglecting interactions ,",
    "the gravitons contribute to the one loop effective action the terms s(g,)+_g-_gh  , which has to be added to the matter effective action .",
    "for the explicit form of the operators we refer to @xcite . using the proper time representation , and the heat kernel expansion ,",
    "the effective action has quartic and quadratic divergences which can be absorbed by redefining the bare couplings @xmath271 and @xmath272 that are present in the bare action @xmath0 . in the gauge @xmath273",
    ", the renormalization conditions can be written in the form @xmath274 where @xmath126 can be viewed here as a renormalization scale .",
    "observe that with these renormalization conditions the effective action is the same as one would have obtained by cutting off the @xmath32integration in at @xmath275 . in other words , @xmath126 behaves exactly as an infrared cutoff .",
    "these renormalization conditions may look a bit strange because of the appearance of the field @xmath21 .",
    "however , we assume here that both @xmath276 and @xmath126 are constant multiples of the dilaton .",
    "defining @xmath277 , @xmath146 the renormalization conditions become @xmath278 taking a @xmath147 derivative and adding the matter contributions , the full beta functions are @xmath279\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these beta functions agree ( for the gravitational part ) with those computed in @xcite using the frge .",
    "they depend explicitly on the independent variable @xmath147 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are measuring all dimensionful quantities in units of the dilaton .",
    "if we measured dimensionful couplings in units of @xmath126 , the beta functions would not contain @xmath126 explicitly .",
    "one can check that rewriting these equations for the variables @xmath280 and @xmath281 one recovers the familiar beta functions of the einstein ",
    "hilbert truncation @xcite and , in the presence of matter @xcite .",
    "the equations ( [ fullbetas ] ) , together with the ir boundary conditions @xmath282 , admit the general solution @xmath283 the gravitational fixed point that one finds in the einstein ",
    "hilbert truncation corresponds to the behavior for large @xmath147 , where @xmath284 and @xmath285 with @xmath286 .",
    "this is consistent with the notion of a fixed point because the wave function renormalization @xmath264 is a redundant coupling @xcite .",
    "one can compute the one  loop contribution of gravitons to the effective action by using non  local heat kernel techniques .",
    "the first term in the curvature expansion is similar to the one given in section 4.2.2 for a scalar field .",
    "in discussions of conformal invariance , misunderstandings frequently arise due to the different physical interpretation of the transformations that are used by different authors . in particle physics language , a theory that contains dimensionful parameters is obviously not conformal .",
    "thus conformal invariance is a property of a very restricted class of theories . in particular , in quantum field theory the definition of the path integral generally requires the use of dimensionful parameters ( cutoffs , renormalization points ) which break conformality even if it was present in the original classical theory .",
    "true conformality is only achieved at a fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "let us call this the point of view i.    on the other hand in weyl s geometry and its subsequent ramifications , conformal ( weyl ) transformations are usually interpreted as relating different local choices of units . since the choice of units is arbitrary and can not affect the physics , it follows that essentially any physical theory can be formulated in a weyl  invariant way .",
    "this point of view is more common among relativists .",
    "let us call it the point of view ii .    the way in which a generic theory containing dimensionful parameters can be made weyl ",
    "invariant is by allowing those parameters to become functions on spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ to become fields .",
    "this is the step that the adherents of the interpretation i are generally unwilling to make , since then one would have to ask whether these fields have a dynamics of their own or not , and , in the quantum case , whether they have to be functionally integrated over or not",
    ". it can be unnatural to have fields in the theory that do not obey some specific dynamical equation , and it is clear that in general , if one allows all the dimensionful couplings to become dynamical fields , the theory is physically distinct from the original one .",
    "there is however one way in which weyl  invariance can be introduced in any theory without altering its physical content , and that is to introduce _ a single _ scalar field , which we called a dilaton ( sometimes also called a `` stckelberg '' or `` weyl compensator '' or `` spurion '' field ) and to assume that all dimensionful parameters are proportional to it .",
    "this field carries a nonlinear realization of the weyl group , since it is not allowed to become zero anywhere .",
    "even though the new field obeys dynamical equations , it does not modify the physical content of the theory because it is exactly neutralized by the enlarged gauge invariance . in practice ,",
    "it can be eliminated by choosing the weyl gauge such that it becomes constant .",
    "all this is well  known in the classical case .",
    "it had already been observed both in a perturbative and nonperturbative context that the above considerations can be generalized to the context of quantum field theory by treating the cutoff or the renormalization point in the same way as the mass or dimensionful parameters that are present in the action . in this paper",
    "we have discussed in particular the formulatiom of the renormalization group using the point of view ii .",
    "it has proven convenient to adopt a non  perturbative definition of the renormalization group , where one considers the dependence of the effective action on an externally prescribed smooth cutoff @xmath126 .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that the resulting `` beta functional '' is both uv and ir finite and one can use it to define a first order differential equation whose solution , for @xmath139 , is the effective action .",
    "it can therefore be viewed as a non  perturbative way of defining ( and calculating ) the effective action . using this method we have shown in complete generality that one can define a flow of weyl  invariant actions",
    "whose ir endpoint is a weyl  invariant effective action .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "this provides an answer to the following question .",
    "suppose we start from a theory that contains dimensionless parameters , and recast it in a weyl  invariant form by introducing a dilaton field .",
    "if we quantize this weyl  invariant theory , is the result equivalent to the one we would have obtained by quantizing the original theory ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , if we use throughout ( _ i.e. _ for all fields ) the weyl ",
    "invariant measure . and",
    "@xmath287 , depending on whether we used for the matter the measures i or ii . clearly the resulting theories are physically inequivalent : in the first case the action is not weyl invariant , so the dilaton field is physical , in the second case the action is weyl invariant and the dilaton can be gauged away .",
    "so , _ all else being equal _ , quantizing matter with measures i and ii leads to physically different theories . ]",
    "thus , there is a quantization procedure that commutes with the st \" uckelberg trick .",
    "it is important to understand that although weyl invariance is not anomalous , there is still a trace anomaly , in the sense that the trace of the energy  momentum , which is classically zero , is not zero in the quantum theory .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that in the weyl ",
    "invariant quantization one obtains an effective action that depends not only on the metric but also on the dilaton .",
    "invariance of the effective action is compatible with a nonvanishing trace , because the latter cancels out against the variation of the dilaton .",
    "( we have provided fully explicit examples of this phenomenon in section 4.2.1 . ) the physics of the weyl ",
    "invariant quantization procedure is completely equivalent to the standard one . in particular",
    ", all the proposed physical applications of the trace anomaly remain valid @xcite .    in order not to modify the dynamics",
    "we have used the `` only one dilaton '' prescription , with the consequence that the cutoff and the dilaton are proportional .",
    "the proportionality factor , which we have called @xmath147 , is the rg parameter in this formulation .",
    "it is dimensionless ( since it expresses the cutoff relative to the unit of mass ) , weyl  invariant and constant on spacetime .",
    "thus , running couplings are functions @xmath288 . in this",
    "we differ from other approaches to dilaton dynamics where the couplings depend on a mass scale @xmath126 that is allowed to be a function on spacetime . in practice",
    "the difference is not so important , because the variation of @xmath288 with respect to @xmath126 , keeping @xmath21 constant , is the same that one would obtain if one assumed that @xmath28 is a function of @xmath126 .    given that in this formalism all theories are conformally invariant , one can also ask what is special about conformal field theories ( in the standard sense of quantum field theory ) , and in particular about fixed points of the renormalization group .",
    "the answer is that for generic theories , conformal invariance is only achieved at the price of having a dilaton in the effective action .",
    "true conformal field theories are conformal even without the dilaton , so one must expect that as the rg flow approaches a fixed point , the dilaton must decouple .",
    "weyl  invariance is the statement of conformal invariance in a general relativistic setting , so we expect the formalism developed here to be especially relevant in the discussion of a possible fixed point for gravity . barring exotic phenomena",
    ", one would expect that a gravitational fixed point must correspond to a weyl  invariant , as opposed to merely globally scale invariant  theory .",
    "we have illustrated in section 6.1 the appearance of a gravitational fixed point in the case of the einstein ",
    "hilbert truncation .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the discussion to higher derivative terms .",
    "in particular it has been observed in @xcite that in an @xmath289truncation a fixed point would correspond to an effective action that is proportional to @xmath290 . as such , this would only be globally scale  invariant .",
    "we conjecture that the fixed point is conformal and that this term should be interpreted as a piece of the euler term , which is the only local , weyl  invariant combination of curvatures besides the square of the weyl tensor . consistently with this , we observe that the rg trajectory that corresponds to the fixed point discussed in section 6.1 , corresponds to putting @xmath291 in . the corresponding eaa is given by with @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "when we take the @xmath209 limit , to obtain the effective action , we find zero .",
    "we conclude by mentioning some possible extensions and applications of this work . recalling that here we have analyzed the case of integrable weyl geometry , it is natural to extend our results to the non  integrable case .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "the example in section 6.2 deals with a truncation of the gravitational action to terms involving at most two derivatives . in four dimensions ,",
    "such terms necessarily have dimensionful couplings . in view of the remarks in the preceding paragraph",
    ", it seems interesting to re  analyze the terms with four derivatives , in particular the weyl  squared and the euler term .",
    "perhaps the most important applications of weyl geometry is to cosmology , where it is often useful to change conformal frame . even at a classical level",
    ", there has been some controversy on the issue whether such frames should be interpreted as defining physically equivalent situations .",
    "our point of view agrees with that of @xcite .",
    "the question is much more delicate in the quantum theory , however . for explicit quantum calculations where",
    "different conformal frames can be seen to yield equivalent physics , see @xcite .",
    "the present work provides a general proof that with a suitable quantization procedure , the equivalence between conformal frames can be maintained also in the quantum theory .",
    "one could use this to study the relation between @xmath289 and scalar ",
    "tensor theories at the quantum level .",
