    "* 1 . pricing and hedging in incomplete markets . *",
    "one of the main problems of the modern finance is : _ how to price derivatives in incomplete markets ? _",
    "the arbitrage theory typically provides price intervals that are unacceptably large . in order to narrow these intervals",
    ", one should use ideas beyond no arbitrage .",
    "one of possible methods has been proposed by carr , geman , and madan  @xcite .",
    "their idea is as follows .",
    "suppose that we have  @xmath2 groups of agents and the @xmath3-th group assesses the quality of any possible trade by taking the expectation of its p&l  @xmath4 with respect to _ valuation measures _",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a trade is profitable for this group if @xmath7 for any  @xmath8 .",
    "natural examples of @xmath5 are given in section  [ bo ] .",
    "a trade is called _ strictly acceptable _ if its p&l satisfies @xmath7 for any @xmath9 .",
    "the no strictly acceptable opportunities assumption says that such trades do not exist .",
    "( this is a natural strengthening of the no arbitrage assumption . )",
    "the fundamental theorem of asset pricing provided in  @xcite states that strictly acceptable opportunities do not exist if and only if @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of risk - neutral measures .",

    "the basic idea of this paper is as follows .",
    "let us call a trade producing a p&l  @xmath4 _ strictly acceptable for the @xmath3-th group _ if @xmath7 for any  @xmath6 .",

    "a remarkable property is : the more groups are taken into account , the smaller are the fair price intervals .",
    "note that the technique described above has exactly the opposite effect .",
    "let us remark that the proposed pricing technique is closely connected with the risk sharing ( or equilibrium ) problem considered in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "sensitivity coefficients .",
    "* two main goals of asset pricing are :    finding fair prices of otc derivatives ;    finding sensitivity coefficients , which is needed for risk management .    in the above discussion , we have concentrated on the first problem .",
    "let us now discuss the second one .",
    "traditionally , in complete models the fair price of a contingent claim is a single number , so that the sensitivity coefficient of the price to the value of an underlying asset can be defined simply by taking the partial derivative . in incomplete markets , we typically have a whole interval of fair prices .",
    "the above efforts were aimed at narrowing this interval , but typically it is not a one - point set .",
    "thus , the partial derivative can not be taken and additional ideas should be used to define sensitivity coefficients . one way to do this",
    "was proposed in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsect .",
    "3.3 ) . in this paper",
    ", we take another path and adjust the pricing technique described above to obtain an interval for a sensitivity .    *",
    "3 . coherent risk .",
    "* the pricing technique described above is closely connected with the notion of a _ coherent risk measure_. this notion was introduced by artzner , delbaen , eber , and heath  @xcite , @xcite as a substitute for v@r , which is notorious for its drawbacks .",
    "this notion turned out to be extremely useful not only for the risk measurement purposes , but also for other financial problems like pricing and optimization ( see  @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a coherent risk measure is a function on random variables defined as @xmath21{0mm}{1mm}}}_{{\\mathsf{q}}\\in{\\mathcal{d}}}{\\mathsf{e}}_{\\mathsf{q}}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a set of probability measures ( @xmath4 means the p&l of some transaction ) .",
    "this formula has a clear interpretation : we have a family  @xmath22 of probabilistic scenarios ; we calculate the average p&l under each scenario ; then we take the worst case .",
    "the relationship between the above considerations and coherent risk measures is obvious .",
    "define the coherent risk measure of the @xmath3-th group as @xmath23{0mm}{1mm}}}_{k=1,\\dots , k^n}{\\mathsf{e}}_{{\\mathsf{q}}^{nk}}x.\\ ] ] the first pricing technique says that @xmath4 is strictly acceptable if @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason , we call here this technique the _ maximum - based pricing_. note that @xmath25 is again a coherent risk measure .",
    "the second technique says that @xmath4 is strictly acceptable if @xmath26 , where the minimum is taken over all @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "the function  @xmath29 is again a coherent risk measure termed the _ convolution of @xmath30_. for this reason , we call this pricing technique the _ convolution - based pricing_.    both pricing techniques described above are taking the path @xmath31 however , one of the most natural ways of constructing the valuation measures @xmath5 is inverting this arrow , i.e. we start from a coherent risk measure  @xmath32 of the @xmath3-th group , find the set @xmath33 such that @xmath34{0mm}{1mm}}}_{{\\mathsf{q}}\\in{\\mathcal{d}}^n}x$ ] , and take  @xmath33 as the set of valuation measures for the @xmath3-th group .",
    "this is meaningful because typically coherent risk measures are defined not through  , but in a more direct way .",
    "for example , the best ( in our opinion ) one - parameter family of coherent risk measures termed _",
    "alpha v@r _ is defined as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a natural number and @xmath37 are independent copies of  @xmath4 .",
    "this class of risk measures was introduced in  @xcite . as shown in that paper",
    ", it is very convenient for the risk measurement purposes .",
    "the sets of valuation measures might be constructed not only from the `` pure '' risk measures like alpha v@r , but also through some `` derivative '' risk measures like factor risks or risk contributions .",
    "they might also be obtained through some basic operations on coherent risks .    in typical cases ,",
    "the sets @xmath33 thus obtained are infinite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we are dealing from the outset with general sets  @xmath33 rather than with valuation measures  @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , as opposed to the majority of papers on coherent risk , we are dealing with unbounded random variables ( clearly , this is necessary for financial applications ) using the framework introduced in  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* 4 . structure of the paper . * in section  [ crm ]",
    ", we recall basic definitions related to coherent risk measures and give several basic examples .",
    "section  [ bo ] has two main goals .",
    "first , we provide natural examples of valuation measures .",
    "these are based on various transformations of coherent risk measures like factor risks or risk contributions .",
    "second , we describe two basic operations on coherent risks : maximum and convolution .",
    "the first operation is at the basis of the pricing technique of section  [ mbp ] ; the second one is at the basis of the pricing technique of section  [ cbp ] .    in section  [ mbp ]",
    ", we consider the maximum - based pricing .",
    "this is , in fact , the pricing technique proposed in  @xcite and extended to a more general framework in  @xcite .",
    "this section is included just for the reader s convenience .",
    "the main results of this paper are presented in section  [ cbp ] . for the convolution - based pricing technique",
    ", we establish the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and find the form of the price intervals . on the mathematical side ,",
    "our statements easily follow from the results of  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this technique with an example of calculating the prices and the superreplication strategy for the case , where different groups are using coherent risk measures from the class weighted v@r .",
    "the quantitative effect arising in this example is very similar to how cdos are arranged .",
    "we also discuss the empirical estimation of fair price intervals provided by other natural classes of valuation measures .",
    "furthermore , we study the liquidity effects following the ideas of  @xcite and the technique of  @xcite .    in section  [ sens ] , we adjust the convolution - based pricing technique to the assessment of sensitivity coefficients .",
