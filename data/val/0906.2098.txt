    "discrete graphical markov models are models for discrete distributions representable by graphs , associating nodes with the variables and using rules that translate properties of the graph into conditional independence statements between variables .",
    "there are several classes of graphical models ; see @xcite for a review . in this paper",
    "we focus on the class of multivariate regression chain graphs and we discuss their definition and parameterization for discrete variables .",
    "multivariate regression chain graphs generalize directed acyclic graphs , which model recursive sequences of univariate responses , by allowing multiple responses . as in all chain graph models",
    "the variables can be arranged in a sequence of groups , called chain components , ordered on the basis of subject - matter considerations , and the variables within a group are considered to be on an equal standing as responses .",
    "the edges are undirected within the chain components , drawn as dashed lines , @xcite , or as bi - directed arrows , @xcite , and directed between components , all pointing in the same direction , i.e. , with no chance of semi - directed cycles .",
    "one special feature of multivariate regression chain graphs is that the responses are potentially depending on all the variables in all previous groups , but not on the other responses .",
    "chain graphs with this interpretation were proposed first by cox and wermuth in @xcite , with several examples in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "in the special case of a single group of responses with no explanatory variables , multivariate regression chain graphs reduce to covariance graphs i.e. , to undirected graphs representing marginal independencies with the basic rule that if any its subgraph is disconnected , i.e. , composed by completely separated sets of nodes , then the associated variables are jointly independent ; see @xcite and @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "the interpretation of the undirected graphs within a chain component is that of a covariance graph , but conditional on all variables in preceding components .",
    "for example , the missing edge @xmath0 in the graph of figure  [ fig : cg](b ) is interpreted as the independence statement @xmath1 , compactly written in terms of nodes as @xmath2 .    the interpretation of the directed edges is that of multivariate regression models , with a missing edge denoting a conditional independence of the response on a variable given all the remaining potential explanatory variables .",
    "thus , in the chain graph of figure  [ fig : cg](a ) the missing arrow @xmath3 indicates the independence statement @xmath4 .",
    "the interpretation differs from that of classical chain graphs , ( lauritzen , wermuth , frydenberg , @xcite , @xcite , lwf for short ) where the missing edges mean conditional independencies given all the remaining variables including the current responses .",
    "however , in studies involving longitudinal data , such as the prospective study of child development discussed in @xcite where there are blocks of joint responses recorded at ages of 3 months , 2 years and 4 years , an analysis conditioning exclusively on the previous developmental states is typically appropriate .",
    "recently , @xcite distinguished four types of chain graphs comprising the classical and the alternative ( andersson , madigan , perlman , @xcite ) chain graph models , called of type i and ii , respectively . in this paper",
    "we give a formal definition of multivariate regression chain graph models and we prove that they are equivalent to the chain graph models of type iv , in drton s classification @xcite .",
    "moreover , we provide a parameterization based on recursive multivariate logistic regression models .",
    "these models , introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.5.4 ) and @xcite can be used to define all the independence constraints .",
    "the models can be defined by an intuitive rule , see theorem  [ prop : base ] , based on the structure of the chain graph , that can be translated into a sequence of explicit regression models .",
    "one consequence of the given results is that any discrete multivariate regression chain graph model is a curved exponential family , a result obtained in @xcite with a different proof .",
    "the basic definitions and notation used in this paper closely follow @xcite , and they are briefly recalled below .",
    "a chain graph @xmath5 is a graph with finite node set @xmath6 and an edge set @xmath7 that may contain either directed edges or undirected edges .",
    "the graph has no semi - directed cycle , i.e. , no path from a node to itself with at least one directed edge such that all directed edges have the same orientation .    ; : @xmath8 ; : @xmath9 .",
    "dashed lines only occur within chain components .",
    ", width=415 ]    the node set @xmath10 of a chain graph can be partitioned into disjoint subsets @xmath11 called _",
    "chain components _ , such that all edges in each subgraph @xmath12 are undirected and the edges between different subsets @xmath13 are directed , pointing in the same direction . for chain graphs with the multivariate regression interpretation the subgraphs @xmath12 within each chain component have undirected dashed ( @xmath14 ) or bi - directed ( @xmath15 ) edges .",
    "the former convention is adopted in this paper .",
    "thus , the chain graph of figure  [ fig : cg](c ) has three chain components , while the previous ones have two components .    given a subset @xmath16 of nodes within a chain component , the subgraph @xmath17 , is said to be _ disconnected _ if there exist two nodes in @xmath18 such that no path in @xmath17 has those nodes as endpoints .",
    "in this case , @xmath18 can be partitioned uniquely into a set of @xmath19 connected components @xmath20 .",
    "otherwise , the subgraph @xmath17 is _",
    "connected_. for example , in chain graph ( c ) of figure  [ fig : cg ] , the subgraph @xmath17 with @xmath21 is disconnected with two connected components @xmath22 and @xmath23 . on the other hand the subgraph @xmath17 with @xmath24",

    "we start the analysis from a given chain graph @xmath43 with an associated collection @xmath26 of chain components .",
    "however in applied work , where variables are linked to nodes by the correspondence @xmath44 for @xmath45 , usually a set of chain components is assumed known from previous studies of substantive theories or from the temporal ordering of the variables . for variables within such chain components no direction of influence",
    "is specified and they are considered as joint responses , i.e. to be on equal standing .",
    "the relations between variables in different chain components are directional and are typically based on a preliminary distinction of responses , intermediate responses and purely explanatory factors .",
    "often , a full ordering of the components is assumed based on time order or on a subject - matter working hypothesis ; see @xcite .    given a chain graph @xmath28 with chain components @xmath46",
    ", we can always define a strict total order @xmath47 of the chain components that is _ consistent _ with the partial order induced by the chain graph , i.e. , such that if @xmath48 then @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , in the chain graph of figure  [ fig : ord](a ) there are four chain components ordered in graph ( b ) as @xmath50 .",

    "in the remainder of the paper we shall assume that a consistent ordering @xmath47 of the chain components is given .",
    "then , for each @xmath34 , the set of all components preceding @xmath34 is known and we may define the cumulative set @xmath52 of nodes contained in the predecessors of component @xmath34 that we sometimes also call the past of @xmath34 .",
