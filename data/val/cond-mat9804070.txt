    "the possibility of square vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors was first proposed by abrikosov @xcite in his original paper on vortex lattices .",
    "however , it was later shown that the hexagonal vortex lattice has a lower free energy for isotropic materials .",
    "@xcite anisotropy in the effective mass or superfluid density tensors cause distortions of this hexagonal lattice simply in proportion to the anisotropy of the magnetic penetration length .",
    "effects due to higher - order anisotropies ( e.g. , in cubic crystals ) were seen in the 1970 s for some low @xmath5 superconductors such as pbtl , pbbi , and nb .",
    "@xcite in some cases , when the external magnetic field was applied along a fourfold symmetric axis of the crystal , the vortices formed a square lattice . when the field was applied along the threefold or twofold symmetric axis of the crystals , hexagonal or distorted hexagonal lattices",
    "were observed , respectively . in the case of nb , for field along",
    "[ 001 ] the square vortex lattice transformed into a hexagonal lattice as the temperature or field increased .",
    "takanaka @xcite introduced terms with cubic anisotropy into the phenomenological ginzburg - landau(gl ) theory to explain the vortex lattice structures quite successfully .",
    "the extra terms arise from anisotropy of the fermi surface .    recently , in @xmath6 , one of the borocarbide family of superconductors , yaron , _",
    "et al._@xcite and eskildsen , _ et al._@xcite have used neutron scattering and bitter decoration to observe the phase transition from a distorted hexagonal vortex lattice aligned with either the [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] directions to a square vortex lattice aligned with the [ 110 ] direction for increasing magnetic field along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "this was the first observation of a square vortex lattice in a strongly type - ii material with @xmath7 .",
    "these experiments have motivated further theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "_ @xcite have analyzed the vortex lattice transition in borocarbides by taking into account the fourfold anisotropic corrections to the london model in the intermediate field region and @xmath8 .",
    "this study revealed two kinds of phase transitions : at small fields ( along the [ 001 ] direction ) , the distorted hexagonal lattice is aligned with a [ 110 ] direction . as the field increases , the lattice reorients along a [ 100 ] direction in a first - order phase transition . at a still higher field the square vortex lattice becomes stable .",
    "the latter phase transition is continuous .",
    "the square vortex lattice has also been observed in other borocarbides such as @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite , using scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) and neutron scattering , respectively .",
    "vortex lattice structures in the high - temperature superconductors have also been studied . for low applied fields along the @xmath11 axis ( normal to the copper - oxide planes )",
    ", the flux lattice can be seen using bitter decoration .",
    "a distorted hexagonal lattice was seen for ybco , @xcite distorted as expected from the in - plane ( @xmath12 ) effective mass anisotropy .",
    "but the stm pictures of the vortex lattice obtained at much higher field @xcite are more consistent with a square lattice that is distorted by effective mass anisotropy .",
    "thus it appears that the hexagonal to square lattice transition that we are studying may also occur in ybco .",
    "motivated by this , affleck _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed how fourfold anisotropic terms can arise in the london free energy due to a @xmath13-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the structure of the vortex lattice near @xmath0 within a generalized ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional .",
    "we consider systems with tetragonal symmetry such as the borocarbides .",
    "the lowest - order term ( ignoring effective mass anisotrpy ) that reduces the symmetry from isotropic down to tetragonal is fourth - order in the spatial derivative and second - order in the order parameter .",
    "we discuss the three distinct terms that can be added to the gl free energy at this order .",
    "these new terms may be treated perturbatively near @xmath0 to first order , demonstrating that the square lattice occurs at high fields where the higher - order gradient terms are more important , while the lattice distorts toward hexagonal at lower fields , in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "the phase transition , which we treat only on a mean - field level , is an ising - type critical point , with the square unit cell distorting into a rhombus in two possible ways by increasing the length of one of its diagonals and reducing the other .",
    "the perturbation expansion has not been carried to higher order , so the quantitative accuracy of the first - order approximation had not previously been estimated . to investigate this",
    "we have numerically determined the phase diagram of this system , locating the upper critical field for various field orientations and the phase boundary separating the square and distorted hexagonal vortex lattice phases .",
    "we find that there are substantial ( up to 50% ) differences from the perturbative approximation , for example in the location of the phase boundary .",
    "thus although the first - order perturbative approximation gives a good qualitative description of the phase diagram , quantitatively accurate results require a proper treatment of higher - order effects .",
    "to study the lowest free energy pattern of the vortex lattice near @xmath0 for tetragonal crystals , we use the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory with added fourfold symmetric fourth - order derivative terms .",
    "the full free energy functional that we minimize ( ignoring thermal fluctuations ) is @xmath14 @xmath15 is the usual gl free energy : @xmath16 for simplicity , we have taken an isotropic effective mass tensor .",
    "tetragonal symmetry , of course , also allows uniaxial effective mass anisotropy , but this can be scaled out by rescaling the @xmath3 axis and the @xmath1 components of the magnetic field .",
    "the only resulting difference is then in the @xmath17 field energy term in @xmath15 , but this does not affect any of our results below .",

    "only terms that are of fourth or higher order in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gradients can reduce the rotational symmetry about the @xmath3-axis from circular down to tetragonal , which is why we add the fourth - order terms to the usual gl free energy .",
    "the anisotropic term may arise simply from fermi - surface anisotropy @xcite or from a d - wave nature of the pairing @xcite .    in the literature @xcite ,",
    "certain particular combinations of the isotropic and the anisotropic fourth order derivative terms in @xmath29 have been used . in our numerics",
    "( below ) , we will also use a specific convenient combination of them .",
    "for the theory as specified above to be stable , the fourth - derivative terms have to be non - negative , which requires @xmath34 . in our notation",

    "the isotropic terms do not by themselves cause any distortion of the hexagonal vortex lattice , but they do change @xmath0 .    for convenience , we introduce the following `` dimensionless '' units : the magnetic field is measured in units of @xmath42 , the vector potential in units of @xmath43 , the length in units of the coherence length @xmath44 , the order parameter in units of the zero - field order parameter magnitude : @xmath45 , and the energy in units of @xmath46 . using these units , the free energy ( [ eq : f - gl ] ) is @xmath47     , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48",

    "the model , in the usual approach of landau theory , has kept only certain terms that are low - order in an expansion in the order parameter , the gradients , and @xmath25 .",
    "the neglected higher - order terms become more important as one moves away from @xmath33 to lower temperature and away from @xmath0 to lower fields . thus the phase diagrams of real systems with different higher - order terms",
    "will increasingly diverge from the behavior we find in this specific model ( [ eq : gl ] ) as one goes to lower temperature .",
    "this is why we did not bother to follow the phase boundary to lower temperature than shown in table [ table : transition ] .    the physically meaningful phase diagram in the magnetic field , temperature plane is shown in figure [ figure : phase ] , with the field and temperature axes scaled by the values of @xmath58 and @xmath25 at the point @xmath115 where the phase boundaries @xmath116 and @xmath117 meet .",
    "although the point at which this happens is at roughly 50% larger @xmath86 than the estimate from the perturbative results , our phase diagram when scaled this way is very close to the one obtained perturbatively by de wilde , _",

    "we find that the dependence of @xmath0 on the angle @xmath52 between the field and the @xmath19 axis contains substantial harmonic content beyond the basic @xmath120 term that is present in the first - order estimate , again indicating contributions beyond first - order in @xmath121 . at @xmath122 , the in - plane @xmath0 variation from [ 100 ] to [ 110 ] directions",
    "is @xmath123 , which is again larger than the 3.6% estimated perturbatively .",
    "the in - plane anisotropy of @xmath124 has recently been measured for luni@xmath125b@xmath125c , where it grows to near 10% at low temperature , indicating that the transition to the square lattice does meet the upper critical field for this material.@xcite",
    "we have numerically determined the vortex lattice phase diagram for a generalized ginzburg - landau model ( [ eq : gl ] ) that includes higher - order terms that reduce the rotational symmetry to tetragonal .",
    "although the results are qualitatively unchanged from the estimates obtained by treating the anisotropic term perturbatively to only first order , there are substantial quantitative differences . in particular , we find that for field along the @xmath3 axis , the phase boundary in the field - temperature plane separating the distorted hexagonal and square vortex lattices meets the upper critical field line with a positive slope at a temperature @xmath2 .",
    "if the field is instead put in the @xmath1 plane at this same temperature , the difference in @xmath0 between the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] directions is about 4.5% .",
    "although this number must be a better estimate than the 3.6% obtained perturbatively , the full ginzburg - landau theory for any given material will contain other higher - order terms that may also have a small influence on this critical anisotropy value .",
