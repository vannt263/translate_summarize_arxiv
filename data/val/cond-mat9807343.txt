    "shortly after the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fractional qhe ) @xcite laughlin @xcite introduced a set of trial wave functions describing the ` parent ' quantum hall states occurring at landau level filling fraction @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an odd integer .",
    "in addition to the ground state , laughlin introduced trial wave functions describing fractionally charged quasielectron @xmath3 and quasihole @xmath4 excitations . from the very beginning it was clear that the wave function for the quasihole , with its simple jastrow form , was more natural than the wave function for the quasielectron , which contains explicit derivatives with respect to electron coordinates .",
    "this difference is reflected , for example , in the fact that while there exists a hamiltonian for which the laughlin ground state and quasihole wave functions are exact ( zero energy ) eigenstates@xcite there exists no such simple hamiltonian for which the quasielectron wave function is also an exact eigenstate .",
    "according to the composite fermion theory , proposed by jain @xcite , the fractional qhe corresponds to an _ integer _",
    "qhe of composite fermions ",
    "electrons bound to an even number of statistical flux quanta .",
    "this identification leads to a procedure for constructing fractional qhe trial states by first constructing integer qhe states , then multiplying by a jastrow factor which binds an even number of vortices to each electron , and finally projecting the resulting state onto the lowest landau level .",
    "the wave function obtained using this procedure for the parent quantum hall state is identical to laughlin s ground state , and the same is true for the quasihole wave function .",
    "however , the composite fermion quasielectron wave function is not identical to the one proposed by laughlin .    to date , the best estimate of the energy gap for creating a quasielectron - quasihole pair with infinite separation at @xmath0 computed using laughlin s trial states was obtained by morf and halperin , using the disk@xcite and spherical@xcite geometries , with the result @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic length .",
    "this may be compared with the result of bonesteel @xcite using the composite fermion quasielectron wave function of @xmath7 .",
    "it therefore appears that the energy gap computed using the laughlin quasielectron is over % 10 lower than that obtained using the composite fermion theory , and so one might conclude that the laughlin quasielectron wave function provides a ( slightly ) better description of the physical quasielectron state .",
    "more recently , girlich and hellmund@xcite have shown that for the truncated ( @xmath8 ) pseudopotential interaction introduced by haldane @xcite , the interaction for which the laughlin ground state and quasihole state are exact eigenstates , the laughlin quasielectron has an energy which is 18 % _ higher _ than the composite fermion quasielectron .",
    "these authors go on to speculate that the same would be true for the coulomb interaction , and this has motivated us to reexamine the calculations of morf and halperin .",
    "taking advantage of the availability of significantly faster computers , and performing a better extrapolation of finite size results to the thermodynamic limit , we find that the @xmath0 energy gap computed using the laughlin quasielectron extrapolates to @xmath9 , a significantly higher result than previously reported . this result is higher than @xmath10 and so is consistent with girlich and hellmund @xcite , though we find that for the coulomb interaction the difference between the two energy gaps is quite small ( less than 5 % ) indicating that both wave functions provide adequate descriptions of the true quasielectron .",
    "we have also performed what we believe are the first calculations of the energy gap using laughlin s quasielectron wave functions for filling fractions @xmath11 and 1/7 . comparing these energies to the corresponding composite fermion energies we find the same result",
    " the composite fermion energy gap is consistently smaller than the corresponding laughlin energy gap . comparing these results to the extrapolated exact diagonalization results of fano et al .",
    "@xcite we find that the composite fermion energy gaps are also consistently closer to the ` exact ' results .",
    "however , as for @xmath0 , the differences are slight , and the main conclusion is that both wave functions provide an adequate description of the physical quasielectron .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the formulation of the two dimensional electron gas on the haldane sphere and introduce a procedure for projecting wave functions on the sphere into the lowest landau level . in sec .",
    "iii we review both the composite fermion construction of the quasielectron state , which requires the projection developed in sec .",
    "ii , as well as the laughlin quasielectron wave function . finally , sec .",
    "iv contains a summary of our results .",
    "we begin by reviewing the problem of one spin polarized electron confined to move on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath12 with a magnetic monopole at its center . following convention",
    "we let @xmath13 denote the number of flux quanta piercing the surface of the sphere due to the monopole .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this particle is then @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the surface of the sphere . in what follows we work in the wu - yang gauge @xcite for which @xmath17 and use the complex stereographic coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath19 in this gauge are the monopole harmonics@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is a jacobi polynomial , @xmath23 , and for a given @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "if we let @xmath26 then the energies of these states are @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the spherical landau level index .",
    "it will be necessary in what follows to project general wave functions onto the lowest landau level @xmath29 hilbert space .",
    "following girvin and jach @xcite we now introduce a general procedure for performing such a projection on the sphere .",
    "first note that the lowest landau level wave functions in the wu - yang gauge are @xmath30 the hilbert space of lowest landau level wave functions on the sphere then corresponds to wave functions of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a polynomial of degree up to @xmath33 in @xmath34 .",
    "the differential area element on the surface of the sphere in terms of the stereographic coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 and so the scalar product between any two polynomials @xmath38 and @xmath39 in this hilbert space is @xmath40 with this definition of the scalar product it is straightforward to derive the following identity by repeatedly integrating by parts , exploiting the fact that @xmath41 , @xmath42 this result immediately implies the following spherical generalization of the @xmath43 rule of girvin and jach to the sphere , @xmath44 thus , to project any polynomial @xmath45 into the lowest landau level one simply orders each term so that the @xmath46 s all sit to the left , then replaces these factors by derivatives with respect to @xmath34 according to ( [ identity ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath47 spin polarized electrons on the sphere interacting via the coulomb repulsion is then @xmath48 the interaction energy @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the chord distance between a given pair of electrons on the sphere . here",
    "the sphere is assumed to have a uniform compensating charge density with total charge @xmath52 .",
    "when considering a homogeneous state the appropriate background charge is @xmath53 for which @xmath54    the spherical analog of the laughlin state@xcite at @xmath1 occurs when @xmath55 and in the wu - yang gauge is @xmath56 the quasihole wave function corresponding to a single charge @xmath57 defect at the top of the sphere ( @xmath58 ) is @xmath59",
    "according to jain s composite fermion approach @xcite a given fractional qhe wave function at filling fraction @xmath60 where @xmath61 is found by first constructing the corresponding _ integer _ qhe wave function at @xmath62 and then multiplying by a jastrow factor which ties @xmath63 vortices to each electron .",
    "the state is then explicitly projected into the lowest landau level . denoting the slater determinant corresponding to the effective integer qhe state , with the overall @xmath64 factor",
    "removed , as @xmath65 , the corresponding fractional qhe states are @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the projection operator onto the lowest landau level .",
    "for the @xmath68 ground state the vandermonde determinant @xmath69 corresponding to one filled ` pseudo'-landau level of composite fermions , gives for @xmath70 the laughlin wave function ( [ laughlings ] ) for @xmath1 where @xmath71 . if we remove a composite fermion from the lowest ` pseudo'-landau level then @xmath72 and @xmath70 is identical to ( [ laughlinqh ] ) and describes a state in which a single quasihole sits at the top of the sphere .",
    "we now consider the quasielectron wave function constructed using this approach .",
    "if we introduce a composite fermion into the first excited ` pseudo'-landau level then @xmath73 and the corresponding physical electron wave function is @xmath74    this wave function can be projected into the lowest landau level as follows . first rewrite @xmath75 by pulling the jastrow factor and the projection operator into the last column of the determinant , @xmath76 this can be done here because the cofactor associated with the @xmath77 element of the @xmath78 column does not contain @xmath79 .",
    "thus , when we do the projection we need only project each element of the matrix separately . following the procedure outlined in sec .",
    "iia this projection gives @xmath80 thus @xmath81 can be rewritten , up to an irrelevant normalization constant , to give @xmath82    one can simplify things further by expanding the determinant in a cofactor expansion down the @xmath78 column .",
    "the cofactors are then all vandermonde determinants and the final expression for the jain quasielectron is @xmath83 in this form @xmath84 can be sampled by usual variational monte carlo techniques with each monte carlo step taking order @xmath47 instructions , rather than @xmath85 for a usual determinant .",
    "the generalization to the spherical geometry of the quasielectron wave function introduced by laughlin is @xmath86 straightforward monte carlo sampling of @xmath87 is not possible because of the explicit derivatives with respect to the electron coordinates . to compute the energy of this state",
    "we therefore follow the procedure of morf and halperin@xcite which , for completeness , we review below .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we first take the absolute square of the wave function to obtain @xmath88 the expectation value of any operator @xmath89 depending only on the coordinates @xmath90 is then @xmath91 which , after integrating by parts twice in the numerator and the denominator can be rewritten @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 the chord distance between any two points on the sphere is given by @xmath95 and so for the coulomb interaction the operator @xmath89 is @xmath96 it is then straightforward to compute @xmath97 and evaluate ( [ exp ] ) by usual variational monte carlo techniques .",
    "the excitation energies of isolated quasielectron and quasihole states have been obtained using the trial wave functions reviewed in secs .",
    "ii and iii .",
    "following @xcite we have computed the _ proper _ energies , meaning that the relevant ground state energies are computed with monopole strength @xmath98 and background charge @xmath53 , while the energy of the quasielectron ( quasihole ) excitations are obtained keeping @xmath12 and @xmath47 fixed and decreasing ( increasing ) the monopole strength according to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "in addition , following @xcite and @xcite , we have shifted the background charge when computing the quasielectron ( quasihole ) energies taking @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , in order to compensate the charge density of the _ bulk _ of the wave function .",
    "this eliminates a finite size correction of @xmath103 , a correction which was not included in @xcite and which may account for the slightly different results obtained here . our results for the proper energies of the quasiholes , the laughlin quasielectrons , and the composite fermion quasielectrons for filling fractions @xmath104 and 1/7 are shown plotted vs. @xmath105 in fig .  1 .    the quasihole energy gaps obtained here , @xmath106 , extrapolated to the @xmath107 limit",
    "are given in table i , together with the @xmath0 result of morf and halperin @xcite and the extrapolated exact diagonalization results of fano et al .",
    "as stated above , the discrepancy between our results and those of morf and halperin is most likely due to the @xmath108 finite size correction we have eliminated by modifying the background charge density .",
    "the quasielectron energy gaps obtained using both the laughlin trial state , @xmath109 , and the composite fermion state , @xmath110 are givin in table ii .",
    "again , in comparing the present @xmath0 result for @xmath109 with those of @xcite we note a slight discrepancy which we attribute to the @xmath108 finite size correction we have included here . for @xmath111 and 1/7",
    "the composite fermion excitation energy @xmath110 is consistently about 10 % lower than the laughlin excitation energy , as can be seen clearly in fig .  1 .",
    "note that the composite fermion result is also in slightly better agreement with the extrapolated exact diagonalization results of fano et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , table iii gives results for the total energy gap for creating a well separated quasielectron quasihole pair , @xmath112 .",
    "the results are again compared with those of @xcite for the laughlin energy gap as well as those of @xcite for the composite fermion energy gap . for @xmath0 our extrapolated energy gap using the laughlin quasielectron",
    "is @xmath113 , roughly 20 % larger than the earlier estimate of morf and halperin @xcite .",
    "our improved calculation gives a laughlin energy gap which is slightly larger than the corresponding energy gap computed using the composite fermion quasielectron , @xmath114 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of girlich and hellmund @xcite using the short - range @xmath8 model ; however , we find here that for the coulomb interaction the energy gaps obtained using these two wave functions are essentially the same .",
    "table iii gives similar results for @xmath11 and 1/7 .",
    "we therefore conclude that that both the laughlin and composite fermion quasielectron wave functions provide adequate descriptions of the physical quasielectron , though the energy gap obtained using the composite fermion quasielectron is slightly closer to extrapolated exact - diagonalization results for all the filling factors we have considered .    to summarize",
    ", the quasielectron and quasihole excitation energies in the fractional qhe have been calculated for @xmath104 and 1/7 by variational monte carlo .",
    "results have been obtained using the quasielectron states originally proposed by laughlin , as well as the fully projected composite fermion quasielectron states proposed by jain .",
    "we have improved on earlier estimates @xcite of the excitation energies of the laughlin states at @xmath0 in order to show that the composite - fermion energy gap is actually slightly lower than the laughlin energy gap , consistent with the results of girlich and hellmund @xcite .",
    "results for the energy gap using laughlin s quasielectron for @xmath11 and 1/7 , obtained here for the first time , show that , as for @xmath0 , for coulomb interactions the energy gaps obtained using the laughlin and composite fermion quasielectron wave functions are essentially the same , though those obtained using the composite fermion quasielectrons are slightly smaller , and closer to extrapolated exact - diagonalization results of fano et al .",
