    "it has been suggested by alastair king in @xcite that every smooth toric variety has a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles .",
    "while this turned out to be false , see @xcite , it is still natural to conjecture that every smooth nef - fano toric variety possesses such a collection , and there is some numerical evidence towards it . here",
    "a variety is called nef - fano ( also often referred to as weak fano ) if its anticanonical class is nef and big , though not necessarily ample .",
    "we refer the readers to the introduction section of @xcite for the more detailed exposition of this area . in this paper",
    "we propose to extend the conjecture of king to smooth toric deligne - mumfod stacks , which were defined in @xcite .    * conjecture [ fsec.conj ] . * _ every smooth nef - fano toric dm stack possesses a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles .",
    "_    there are multiple advantages to working with stacks rather than varieties in the context of this conjecture .",
    "smooth toric dm stacks behave like smooth toric varieities in many ways , so it is plausible that if conjecture [ fsec.conj ] holds in the case of varieties , then it holds in this more general setting , at least when the stacks are generically schemes . on the other hand , while there are only finitely many smooth toric nef - fano varieties in any given dimension , there are infinitely many smooth toric fano stacks , and they correspond to nice combinatorial data of simplicial convex lattice polytopes . consequently , working with stacks allows one to test the conjecture on numerous families of examples , and to concentrate on the more essential features of the fano condition .",
    "last , but not least , stacks appear naturally from the point of view of homological mirror symmetry .",
    "for example , it is natural to try to extend the work of @xcite to this generality ,    we have been able to construct full strong exceptional collections of line bundles for all smooth toric fano dm stacks @xmath0 of picard number at most two or , significantly , of dimension at most two .",
    "this dimension two case is of special importance since it is related to ( noncompact ) toric calabi - yau stacks of dimension three .",
    "the main ingredient of the argument is a convex polytope @xmath1 in @xmath2 which is to be thought of as a window into @xmath3 . for a generic point @xmath4",
    ", we define the strong exceptional collection @xmath5 as the set of line bundles such that the corresponding points in @xmath2 lie in @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", @xmath5 is the set of line bundles that we can see through the @xmath1 window , when it is shifted by @xmath7 .",
    "we then move @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and as new line bundles appear in the window , we use koszul complexes to generate them from the line bundles that we have already seen . in the picard number one case , @xmath1 is a segment , and in the picard number two case it is a parallelogram , irrespective of the dimension of @xmath0 . in the case of picard number three and dimension two ,",
    "the polytope @xmath1 is a @xmath8-gonal prism , and careful arguments of convex geometry are needed to establish its various properties . for arbitrary picard numbers and dimension two , @xmath1 is a zonotope , i.e. a minkowski sum of line segments .",
    "one key property of the polytope @xmath1 is that the differences between all pairs of its interior points give acyclic line bunldles . to prove this",
    ", we introduce the notions of strong acyclicity and forbidden cones , see definition [ forbidden ] .",
    "this approach follows the calculations of danilov @xcite and is similar to the recent work of perling @xcite in the scheme setting .",
    "the notion of strong acyclicity allows one to reduce the calculations to questions of convex geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",

    "we describe line bundles on these stacks and state the main conjecture [ fsec.conj ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we give a combinatorial description of cohomology of a line bundle on a smooth toric deligne - mumford stack and introduce the notions of strong acyclicity and forbidden cones . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we describe the construction in the cases of picard number one and two .",
    "sections [ sec.dp.prelim ] and [ sec.dp ] treat the case of smooth toric del pezzo dm stacks .",

    ". we might no longer be able to guarantee in proposition [ movinglemma ] that the shifts of the interior of the face lie in the interior of @xmath305 , but it is still likely that in the proof of theorem [ delpezzo ] the new points in @xmath430 could be expressed in terms of the old ones as @xmath378 increases .",
    "another reason not to consider the nef case in this article is that the work of kawamata @xcite assures that the derived category of a nef del pezzo toric stack is equivalent to that of the corresponding @xmath72-equivalent del pezzo toric stack obtained by only keeping the vertices of @xmath71 .",
    "hence our results already guarantee the existence of a strong exceptional collection of objects in the derived category of a nef del pezzo toric stack , although these objects might not be line bundles .",
    "in this section we will illustrate the result and construction of sections [ sec.dp.prelim ] and [ sec.dp ] in the case of @xmath264 .",
    "let @xmath433 be a convex pentagon in @xmath266 , with the vertices counted clockwise , which contains @xmath183 in its interior .",
    "let @xmath21 be the corresponding stacky fan and @xmath0 the corresponding del pezzo dm stack .",
    "as before , we denote by @xmath20 the vector from @xmath183 to @xmath269 and by @xmath55 the corresponding elements of the picard group .",
    "we will introduce the notation @xmath434 where @xmath72 is the canonical class .",
    "we will abuse the notation and denote by @xmath55 the image of @xmath435 in @xmath9 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath275 for the image of @xmath55 in @xmath273 .",
    "the polytope @xmath276 in @xmath436 is given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is a convex centrally symmetric @xmath8-gon .",
    "the projections of the forbidden cones for proper subsets @xmath437 are given in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the complement of it is the acyclic region , in the sense that any line bundle @xmath75 which projects to it has no middle cohomology .",
    "for any point @xmath438 in @xmath436 , we can consider the points obtained from it by flipping it across the vertices of @xmath276 .",
    "a flip of a point @xmath439 across a point @xmath440 is @xmath441 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath442 implies that if one starts with a point @xmath438 and flips it across @xmath443 , then the @xmath8-th vertex is again @xmath438 , and the ten vertices are @xmath444    it is a priori not obvious that one can pick @xmath438 in such a way that the resulting ten points form vertices of a convex polytope that contains @xmath276 .",
    "however , by proposition [ allabouthatp ] there exists a convex polygon @xmath305 such that the midpoints of its edges are the vertices of @xmath276 .",
    "hence one can pick @xmath438 so that the above 10 points are vertices of @xmath305 .",
    "in particular , the interior of @xmath305 lies in the acyclic region , see figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "proposition [ movinglemma ] can be stated as follows .",
    "it will be convenient to consider the indices @xmath118 of @xmath269 to lie in @xmath445 .",
    "[ move ] for an edge of @xmath305 that contains @xmath446 , the translates of its interior by @xmath447 , @xmath448 , @xmath449 and @xmath450 lie in the interior of @xmath305 . for an edge of @xmath305 that contains @xmath451 ,",
    "the translates of its interior by @xmath452 , @xmath453 , @xmath454 and @xmath455 lie in the interior of @xmath305 .    for what follows we pick and fix a generic collection of positive numbers @xmath456 , such that @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "this collection gives a linear function @xmath210 on @xmath9 by @xmath211 .",
    "the convex polytope @xmath1 in @xmath9 given by the inequalities @xmath457 and the condition that the image of @xmath219 in @xmath436 lies in @xmath382 is depicted in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the polytope @xmath1 has two @xmath8-gonal faces and @xmath8 parallelogram faces that are preimages of the sides of the pentagon @xmath366 , see figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ delpezzo ] can be visualized as follows .",
    "we place the polytope @xmath1 somewhere generically in @xmath9 by considering its shift @xmath6 .",
    "the set of line bundles whose images in @xmath9 lie in @xmath6 form a strong exceptional collection .",
    "indeed , the differences avoid the forbidden cone @xmath458 with the vertex @xmath459 because they have @xmath460 , and they avoid the other forbidden cones because their image in @xmath273 is contained in @xmath305 and hence in the acyclic region .",
    "we then define the category @xmath166 generated by the line bundles in this strong exceptional collection .",
    "we first move the polytope @xmath6 in generic directions that are parallel to its 10-gonal facets . as the polytope moves",
    ", any new points can be connected to already covered points by means of proposition [ move ] .",
    "this in turn leads to koszul complexes which allow one to show that the corresponding line bundles lie in @xmath166 .",
    "after we have guaranteed that all points between the supporting planes of the 10-gonal facets of @xmath6 correspond to line bundles in @xmath166 , we use koszul complexes to extend in the orthogonal direction , as in the second panel of figure [ figpic2 - 3 ] .",
    "it is natural to try to apply the techniques of this paper to the general case of king s conjecture . for an arbitrary rank of the picard group , and arbitrary dimension",
    ", one can still define the polytope @xmath276 in @xmath436 as the minkowski sum of @xmath279 $ ] .",
    "one then wants to construct a polytope @xmath461 with the property that all vertices of @xmath276 that correspond to forbidden cones are midpoints of some of the faces of @xmath305 and that midpoints of all facets of @xmath305 are images of the vertices of the forbidden cones .",
    "it is not a priori clear that @xmath305 should be a zonotope , although this is a plausible assumption .",
    "however even assuming that it is , the combinatorics of it is generally unclear and remains the key challenge .",
    "once the polytope @xmath305 is constructed , we can define the polytope @xmath1 in @xmath9 as in section [ sec.dp ] .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this approach will lead to a proof of conjecture [ fsec.conj ] , but it appears promising ."
