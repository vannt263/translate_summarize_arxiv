    "research efforts to maintain this trend have been focusing on : ( _ i _ ) the advantageous substitution of sio@xmath4 by high dielectric constant materials to allow equivalent gate dielectric oxide thickness bellow 1 nm @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) a better understanding of the fractal regime of ultra - thin gate dielectric oxide growth , where spatial inhomogeneities or fluctuations are important @xcite considerations for the control of dielectric breakdown conditions .",
    "consequently , the reliability of ultra - thin oxides for ultra - large scale integration is one of the most important concerns in the domain of electronics miniaturization nowadays @xcite .",
    "two quantities which are experimentally measured to assess the reliability of a metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) device are : the charge - to - breakdown @xmath5 , defined as the time - integrated current density which flows until breakdown occurs , and the time - to - breakdown @xmath3 , defined as the samples lifetime .",
    "these quantities are statistically distributed and are usually assumed to be weibull distributed @xcite",
    ". in particular , accurate assessment of reliability of ultra - thin oxides is seriously affected by fluctuations of oxide thickness .",
    "these fluctuations cause a deviation from the weibull distribution , which is easily observed by a curvature in a graph of @xmath6 $ ] versus @xmath7 $ ] , being@xmath8 the cumulative distribution .",
    "extrapolation of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles to lower failure percentiles can lead to serious errors in reliability assessment , as shown by wu _",

    "deviations from a given distribution can be generated by taking scale mixtures of it @xcite .",
    "for instance , the scale parameter of the exponential and gaussian distributions can be averaged by a gamma distribution . in these two cases ,",
    "the deviation induced by the fluctuation in this parameter has been successfully employed in the description of physical situations , such as those related with nonexponential decay @xcite and turbulence @xcite .",

    "in view of this observation and following ref .",
    "@xcite , we refer to @xmath24 as @xmath2-weibull distribution .",
    "we also remark that @xmath24 contains a broad class of distributions as particular cases .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath32 it reduces to the weibull distribution , for @xmath33 it gives the @xmath2-exponential distribution , and when @xmath32 and @xmath33 it becomes the exponential distribution .",
    "furthermore , from eq.([qw ] ) we verify two power law regimes , one for small @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and another for large @xmath34 , @xmath36 .",
    "notice also that @xmath37 exists and is equal to one when @xmath38 .    before addressing our discussion to the application of the @xmath2-weibull distribution concerning experimental and simulation results",
    ", we give a connection of this distribution with the tsallis statistics . the first step towards verifying this connection",
    "is based on the fact that the @xmath2-exponential can be viewed as a signature of the tsallis statistics , since it basically replaces the exponential in the canonical distribution .",
    "in fact , this canonical distribution is obtained when the tsallis entropy @xmath39 is maximized subjected to appropriate constraints @xcite . here , @xmath40 is the probability of the @xmath41th state , @xmath42 is the number of accessible states , and @xmath2 is a real parameter that rules the degree of generalization of the theory ( when @xmath43 we recover the usual entropy ) . on the other hand , the @xmath2-exponential function can be obtained from the average of the exponential function by using the gamma distribution , eq . ( [ beta ] )",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath2 occurring in the tsallis statistics is shown to be entirely induced by the fluctuations of the parameter of the usual exponential distribution @xcite . following this interpretation ,",
    "the average process employed to obtain @xmath24 characterizes an implicit connection with the tsallis statistics .",

    "will be referred as a @xmath2-weibull plot .    to compare the usefulness of the weibull and the @xmath2-weibull distributions , we analyze experimental @xcite and simulation results .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) , which is adapted from the work of wu et _ al . _",
    "@xcite , shows a curvature in a graph @xmath52 $ ] versus @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the variation of this slope is associated with oxide thickness fluctuations .",
    "in fact , wu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were able to generate this slope variation by performing simulations in which the oxide thickness obeyed a gaussian distribution .",
    "extrapolation of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles ( conventional experimental window ) to lower failure percentiles leads to an error in @xmath3 projection and , consequently , in projection of reliability .",
    "it is necessary to use large and time - consuming sample sizes ( thousands of devices ) in order to obtain @xmath3 distributions down to lower percentiles and avoid erroneous projections .",
    "the same @xmath3 data can be correctly fitted in the entire range of percentiles by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) . in the @xmath2-weibull plot",
    ", the data follow a straight line .",
    "we conclude that , by taking the fluctuations of the modal parameter of the weibull distribution into account , one obtains a statistical distribution which completely describes @xmath3 data when oxide fluctuations are present .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2-weibull distribution allows improved @xmath3 projection for ultra - thin oxides and does not require a very large number of samples , _",
    "i.e. _ , correct @xmath3 extrapolation can be performed in the conventional experimental window .",
    "this is a striking benefit brought by the @xmath2-weibull distribution .",
    "in addition to correct @xmath3 projection , we have found that the @xmath2-weibull also improves area scaling , another important consideration for reliability studies @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we have used the data from the work of teramoto _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "they studied the time - dependent dielectric breakdown for @xmath10 thin sio@xmath4 oxides with samples areas of @xmath12 and @xmath53 , and subjected to a @xmath54 applied field .",
    "it is clear , when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better area scaling than the weibull one , another remarkable benefit .",
    "when @xmath3 data are plotted in a limited range of percentiles , the differences between the @xmath2-weibull and the weibull distributions become less apparent , but can still be seen . as an example , we consider the simulations performed by sombra _",
    "they developed a percolation model to describe the dielectric breakdown of a mos capacitor investigating effects of bias polarity , oxide film thickness and electric field strength .",
    "the hot electron injection is either through the gate or the substrate . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we have performed a linear fit of the simulation data of sombra @xcite with the weibull distribution , while in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) we depict the same data but with a linear fit through the @xmath2-weibull distribution .",
    "one can see once more that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better fit than the weibull one , for small and large @xmath3 .",
    "in summary , we conclude that : ( _ i _ ) fluctuation on the modal value is a mechanism to explain deviations from the weibull distribution in reliability studies of electronics devices ; ( _ ii _ ) this fluctuation leads to a generalization of the weibull distribution ( @xmath2-weibull distribution ) and a connection with the tsallis statistics ; and ( _ iii _ ) the generalized weibull distribution leads to a better adjustment of experimental and simulated data in comparison with the weibull one , giving improved @xmath3 extrapolation and area scaling .",
    "finally , the results presented here can be very useful for an improved description of the dielectric breakdown in the high dielectric constant materials @xcite which will be present in future generations of advanced mos devices .",
