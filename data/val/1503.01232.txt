    "the problem of sewing these together into a coherent description of a causal or probabilistic universe lies at the foundations of physical law .",
    "these long - standing topics are receiving renewed attention due to the increasing precision of experiments on trapped quantum systems@xcite and the corresponding ability to probe the nature of decoherence processes.@xcite parallel developments in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of open systems are building an increasingly powerful toolset for predicting their often non - intuitive behavior.@xcite important studied applications include spectroscopy@xcite , quantum computing,@xcite reaction rate theory,@xcite mixed quantum - classical molecular dynamics@xcite , and superconducting nanocircuits.@xcite    recently , a general unifying theoretical framework for non - equilibrium thermodynamics was proposed for classical systems.@xcite such a framework has been a long sought goal for the nonequilibrium community.@xcite it takes the form of a maximum entropy distribution over each transition step between the current and future positions and momenta , @xmath0 the two constraints in the exponent are the average deviation of the square of the action functional , and the average change in total energy .",

    "the _ kinetic _ partition function , @xmath6 , is a moment generating function that contains all the information about force / flux relationships .",
    "it makes an appearance in both the nonlinear fluctuation - dissipation and entropy production relations.@xcite it also provides a physical interpretation of the lagrange multipliers ( collision rate , temperature , etc . ) as constant forces responsible for bringing about equilibrium through noisy energy exchange with external systems .",
    "equilibrium properties like temperature , pressure , or chemical potential are only defined for the central system through the action of an external thermostat able to exchange energy , volume , or molecules  a consistent interpretation of temperature out of equilibrium.@xcite    importantly , this work established that dynamic processes can serve as the foundation for statistical mechanics .",
    "in contrast to the fluctuation theorems , it does not require boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium distributions ( or even stationary states ) for initial and final densities .",
    "rather , the dynamics is determined directly from maximum transition entropy . apart from being the stationary state of the dynamics , the boltzmann distribution plays no special role .",
    "the log - ratio of forward and backward ( inference ) probabilities , @xmath7 determines the ` amount of irreversibility ' for the entire process .",
    "it consists of changes in the information entropy of the system plus heat rejected to the environment .",
    "the reverse process is determined by attempting to infer the starting distribution from the final one  a process subtly different from time reversal .",
    "most notably , since @xmath8 is a lagrange multiplier favoring transitions with smaller energy exchange , @xmath9 , this changes sign during inference to find starting states with larger energy .",
    "based on the success of this work , it is reasonable to ask whether these results can be extended to describe quantum dynamics .",
    "the result would be a theory that directly models the statistics of transitions between quantum states , deriving thermodynamics as a consequence .",
    "one major obstacle stands in the way of such an extension .",
    "the quantum measurement problem tangles up position and momenta , obscuring the classical picture of phase space .",
    "this means that it is not possible to define a single path or trajectory which a wavefunction undergoes to transition from one time point to the next .",
    "this problem manifests in a variety of ways , including very high frequency oscillations in the propagator for the wigner distribution and wavefunction collapse in matrix mechanics .",
    "this paper presents a novel statement of a transition probability distribution over quantum states .",
    "it retains much of the structure of the classical nonequilibrium theory referred to above .",
    "the distribution reduces to ordinary quantum dynamics when a collision rate parameter is set to zero . at nonzero rate parameter",
    ", the transition probability contains an exponential bias toward trajectories representing exchange of energy with an external thermostatic reservoir .",
    "additionally , a normalization constant for each step of the dynamics acts as a moment generating function for the energy fluxes , and a measure of irreversibility over a single timestep can be directly interpreted in terms of heat and work .    in what follows",

    "the conclusion discusses interpretation questions and future extensions and applications of the results .",
    "the appendix contains a detailed proof that the maximum transition entropy approach reduces to the density - matrix master equation of caldeira and leggett in the high - temperature limit .",
    "exact quantum dynamics follows unitary evolution , @xmath10 or , for the density matrix @xmath11 , @xmath12 the unitarity of @xmath13 means that both angles and distances between alternate state vectors , @xmath14 , remain unaltered during time evolution .",
    "this also leads the eigenvalues of @xmath15 to remain constant , so that entropy is a constant of the dynamics .",
    "a modification introduced by jaynes@xcite was to consider multiple alternative , unitary time evolution operations , @xmath16 the final state density matrix then becomes a mixture of outcomes due to the unknown hamiltonian that was applied to evolve the system in time .",
    "unfortunately , this mixing picture was left incomplete , since it could not account for the temperature of the external system , and thus to lead to the thermal distribution .    for defining @xmath17",

    "in addition , jaynes showed that the unweighted process always contains the uniform ( infinite temperature ) distribution as a stationary state .",
    "the first central question in the theory of open quantum systems is , `` how do we assign probabilities to the collision events ? ''",
    "fermi s golden rule is the traditional answer , but depends on assuming a directionality and time - dependence for the external energy . in a real interaction process , however , more collisions will occur when the central system is moving with larger velocity .",
    "in addition , the energy of the external system will decrease as the collision proceeds . the system s energy change due to the impulse will then depend on the system s initial momentum and the external force correlation time .",
    "the classical nonequilibrium theory@xcite modeled these random collisions by a maximum entropy distribution for @xmath33 , conditional on the average impulse size , @xmath34 and the energy change , @xmath35 .",

    "the next subsections develop this analysis for several possible exponential biasing forms .",
    "once a probability scheme is chosen , one encounters the second central question of open quantum systems , `` should time evolution be described by statistics of multiple individual wavefunctions or by the statistics of the time - evolution operator ? ''",
    "this work refrains from considering statistics among alternate density matrices or among non - orthogonal sets of wavefunctions .    in principle",
    ", there are two different types of prior information for assigning probabilities to alternate transitions  creating weights that rely on complete knowledge of the system wavefunction , @xmath26 , or incorporation of a weighting into the transition operators themselves .",
    "these are dual to one another in the same sense that the schrdinger picture is dual to the heisenberg one .",
    "both lead to a scheme for moving from a starting pure wavefunction to a density matrix a short instant later .",
    "the first approach leads to transition weights , @xmath40 , that depend exponentially on @xmath26 .",
    "[ s : psiwt ] shows this choice to be inadmissible based on the known properties of the measurement process .",
    "the second method fixes this defect by working in superoperator space . here",
    ", it is possible to average over all propagators , @xmath41 , treating them as members of a linear set of dimension @xmath42 ( eq .  [ e : canon ] ) . weighting the result by performing a similarity transformation is equivalent to weighting each propagator , and results in a propagator that is linear in @xmath15 except for normalization .",
    "since each possible time evolution operation ( @xmath17 ) influences the energy of the isolated system , we can choose @xmath24 in the quantum evolution operation ( eq .  [ e : jaynes ] ) to be consistent with energy conservation .",
    "for a prescribed average energy change , the maximum entropy form is , @xmath43 the probability distribution over @xmath19 is therefore conditional on the starting state , @xmath44 .",
    "this conditioning reduces the likelihood of interactions with the external environment that raise the energy of the system .    using random impulsive @xmath17 with this probability assignment",
    ", the wavefunction @xmath26 continually diffuses through hilbert space . despite the similarity to quantum state diffusion,@xcite",

    "[ e : maxent ] and the associated `` kinetic '' partition function , @xmath45 are relatively straightforward , except that the probability distribution is over the random perturbation rather than over the physical system of interest .",

    "we note that quantum state diffusion does not seem to have this drawback , since the form of the dynamics is such that the density matrix found by averaging @xmath53 at each timestep conforms to the master equation in lindblad form.@xcite    in addition to this problem , note that there is also a loss of compactness in describing a weighting over transition processes , @xmath17 .",
    "for example , two distinct propagators , @xmath17 and @xmath54 , could lead to the same final @xmath55 .",
