    "for quantum fields living on a pseudo - riemannian manifold , the experiences of observers coupled to the field depend both on the quantum state of the field and on the worldline of the observer  @xcite .",
    "a  celebrated example is the unruh effect  @xcite , in which uniformly accelerated observers in minkowski spacetime experience a thermal bath in the quantum state that inertial observers perceive as void of particles .",
    "other well - studied examples arise with black holes that emit hawking radiation @xcite and with observers in spacetimes of high symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a useful tool for analysing the experiences of an observer is a model particle detector that follows the observer s worldline and has internal states that couple to the quantum field .",
    "such detectors are known as unruh - dewitt ( udw ) detectors  @xcite . while much of the early literature on the udw detectors focused on stationary situations , including the unruh effect  @xcite , the detectors remain well defined also in time - dependent situations , where they can be analysed within first - order perturbation theory @xcite as well as by nonperturbative techniques  @xcite .",
    "a  review with further references can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a detector coupled to a quantised scalar field in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "a scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions has local propagating degrees of freedom , and it exhibits the hawking and unruh effects just like a scalar field in higher dimensions .",
    "however , the dynamics of the field in 1 + 1 dimensions is significantly simpler than in higher dimensions , especially for a massless minimally coupled field , for which the field equation is conformally invariant and conformal techniques are available . in particular , the evolution of a massles minimally coupled field on a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional collapsing star spacetime reduces essentially to that of a massless field on ( 1 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime in the presence of a receding mirror , and the system is explicitly solvable  @xcite .",
    "the simplifications in the dynamics in @xmath2 dimensions come however at a cost : the wightman function of a minimally coupled field in 1 + 1 dimensions is infrared divergent in the massless limit .",
    "while hadamard states can still can be defined in terms of the short distance expansion of the wightman function  @xcite , the hadamard expansion contains an additive constant that is not determined by the quantum state . while this undetermined additive constant does not contribute to stress - energy expectation values  @xcite ,",
    "it does contribute to the transition probability of an udw detector that couples to the value of the field at the detector s location .",
    "in stationary situations the ambiguous contribution to transition probablities can be argued to vanish , under suitable assumptions about the switch - on and switch - off  @xcite , but in nonstationary situations the ambiguity is more severe and has been found to lead to physically undesirable predictions in examples that include a receding mirror spacetime  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyse a detector that is insensitive to the infrared ambiguity of the @xmath0-dimensional wightman function in the massless minimaly coupled limit : we couple the detector linearly to the _ derivative _ of the field with respect to the detector s proper time  @xcite , rather than to the value of the field .",
    "working in first - order perturbation theory , the detector s transition probability involves then the double derivative of the wightman function , rather than the wightman function itself .",
    "we show that the response of the @xmath0-dimensional derivative - coupling detector is closely similar to that of the @xmath3-dimensional detector with a non - derivative coupling  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the transition probablity can be written as an integral formula that involves no short - distance regulator at the coincidence limit but contains instead an additive term that depends only on the switching function that controls the switch - on and switch - off .",
    "a consequence is that in the limit of sharp switching the transition probability diverges but the transition rate remains finite .",
    "we carry out three checks on the physical reasonableness of the derivative - coupling detector in stationary situations in which the switch - on is pushed to asymptotically early times .",
    "first , we verify that the transition rate is continuous in the limit of vanishing mass for an inertial detector in minkowski space , with the field in minkowski vacuum , and we show that the same holds also for a static detector in minkowski half - space with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "this is evidence that the derivative coupling manages to remove the infrared ambiguity of the massless field without producing unexpected discontinuities in the massless limit .",
    "second , we show that the transition rate of a uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski space , coupled to a massless field in minkowski vacuum , coincides with that of an inertial detector at rest with a thermal bath , being in particular thermal in the sense of the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) property  @xcite .",
    "this shows that the derivative - coupling detector sees the usual unruh effect for a massless field .",
    "third , we show that in a thermal bath of a massless field in minkowski space , the transition rate of an inertial detector that is moving with respect to the bath is a sum of two terms that are individually thermal but at different temperatures , related to the temperature of the bath by doppler shifts to the red and to the blue .",
    "as these terms stem respectively from the right - moving and left - moving components of the field , the temperature shifts are exactly as one would expect .",
    "after these checks , we focus on the massless minimally coupled field in two nonstationary situations , each of interest for the hawking - unruh effect .",
    "we first consider a minkowski spacetime with a mirror whose exponentially receding motion makes the field mimic the late time behaviour of a field in a collapsing star spacetime  @xcite . we show that at late times the detector s transition rate is the sum of a planckian contribution , corresponding to the field modes propagating away from the mirror , and a vacuum contribution , corresponding to the field modes propagating towards the mirror . while the detector couples to the sum of the two parts , the two parts can nevertheless be unambiguously identified by considering their dependence on the detector s velocity with respect to the rest frame in which the mirror was static in the asymptotic past .",
    "we also show numerical results on how the transition rate evolves from the asymptotic early time form to the asymptotic late time form .",
    "these properties of the transition rate are in full agreement with the energy flux emitted by the mirror  @xcite .",
    "we then consider a detector falling inertially into the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole , with the field in the hartle - hawking - israel ( hhi ) and unruh vacua . starting the infall at the asymptotic infinity",
    ", we verify that the early time transition rate in the hhi vacuum is as in a thermal state , in the usual hawking temperature , while in the unruh vacuum it is as in a thermal state for the outgoing field modes and in the boulware vacuum for the ingoing field modes .",
    "the outgoing and ingoing contributions can again be unambiguously identified by considering their dependence on the detector s velocity in the asymptotic past .",
    "the transition rate remains manifestly nonsingular on horizon - crossing , and we present numerical evidence of how the thermal properties are gradually lost during the infall . near the black hole singularity",
    "the transition rate diverges proportionally to @xmath1 where @xmath4 is the schwarzschild radial coordinate .",
    "these results are in full agreement with the known properties of the hhi and unruh vacua , including their thermality , their invariance under schwarzschild time translations and their regularity across the future horizon .",
    "we anticipate that the derivative - coupling detector will be a useful tool for probing a quantum field in other situations where the infrared properties raise technical difficulties for the conventional udw detector .",
    "one such instance is when the field has zero modes , which typically occur in spacetimes with compact spatial sections  @xcite .",
    "other instances may arise in analogue spacetime systems @xcite or in spacetimes where the back - reaction due to hawking evaporation is strong ( for a small selection of references see @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : detector ] we introduce the derivative - coupling detector , write the transition probability in a regulator - free form and provide the formula for the transition rate in the sharp switching limit .",
    "consistency checks in three stationary situations are carried out in section  [ sec : tests ] . sections [ sec : recmir ] and [ sec : bh ] address respectively the receding mirror spacetime and the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the results are summarised and discussed in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "details of technical calculations are deferred to four appendices .",
    "our metric signature is @xmath5 , so that the norm squared of a timelike vector is negative .",
    "we use units in which @xmath6 , so that frequencies , energies and temperatures have dimension inverse length .",
    "spacetime points are denoted by sans serif characters ( @xmath7 ) and spacetime indices are denoted by @xmath8 .",

    "in this section we introduce an udw detector that couples linearly to the proper time derivative of a scalar field @xcite .",
    "we show , within first - order perturbation theory , that in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions the detector s transition probability and transition rate are closely similar to those of a @xmath3-dimensional udw detector with a non - derivative coupling  @xcite .",
    "our detector is a spatially point - like quantum system with two distinct energy eigenstates .",
    "we denote the normalised energy eigenstates by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with the respective energy eigenvalues @xmath19 and  @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the detector moves in a spacetime of dimension @xmath16 along the smooth timelike worldline  @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the proper time , and it couples to a real scalar field @xmath24 via the interaction hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a coupling constant , @xmath27 is the detector s monopole moment operator and the switching function @xmath28 specifies how the interaction is switched on an off .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 is real - valued , non - negative and smooth with compact support .    where @xmath29 differs from the usual udw detector @xcite is that the interaction is linear in the proper time derivative of the field , rather than in the field itself .",
    "an alternative expression is @xmath30 , where the overdot denotes @xmath31 .",
    "we take the detector to be initially in the state @xmath17 and the field to be in a state  @xmath32 , which we assume to be regular in the sense of the hadamard property  @xcite .",
    "after the interaction has been turned on and off , we are interested in the probability for the detector to have made a transition to the state  @xmath18 , regardless the final state of the field . working in first - order perturbation theory in  @xmath26",
    ", we may adapt the analysis of the usual udw detector @xcite to show that this probability factorises as @xmath33 where @xmath34 depends only on the internal structure of the detector but neither on @xmath32 , the trajectory or the switching , while the dependence on @xmath32 , the trajectory and the switching is encoded in the response function  @xmath35 . with our @xmath29 , the response function is given by @xmath36 where the correlation function @xmath37 is the pull - back of the wightman function @xmath38 to the detector s world line .    from now on we",
    "drop the constant prefactors in and refer to the response function as the transition probability .    as @xmath32 is hadamard and the detector",
    "s worldline is smooth and timelike , the correlation function @xmath39 is a well - defined distribution on @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath28 is smooth with compact support , it follows that @xmath35 is well defined : given a family of functions @xmath41 that converges to the distribution @xmath39 as @xmath42 , @xmath35 is evaluated by first making in the replacement @xmath43 , then performing the integrals , and finally taking the limit @xmath42 .",
    "the limit @xmath44 may however not necessarily be taken under the integrals .",
    "for the usual udw detector , for which the response function is given as in but without the derivatives , this issue is known to become subtle if one wishes to define an instantaneous transition rate by passing to the limit of sharp switching : the subtleties start in three spacetime dimensions and increase as the spacetime dimension increases and the correlation function becomes more singular at the coincidence limit @xcite .",
    "we may expect similar subtleties for the derivative - coupling detector , and since the derivatives in increase the singularity of the integrand at the coincidence limit , we may expect the subtleties to start in lower spacetime dimensions than for the usual udw detector .",
    "we confirm these expectations in subsections [ subsec : detector:1 + 1resp ] , [ subsec : detector:1 + 1sharp ] and [ subsec : stationary ] by analysing the response function and the transition rate in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we now specialise to @xmath0 spacetime dimensions . in this subsection",
