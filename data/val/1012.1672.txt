    "this paper studies incentive schemes to sustain cooperation among self - interested users sharing a common network resource . when users utilize the network resource considering their own self - interest , a problem known as the tragedy of the commons @xcite is likely to occur , yielding a suboptimal performance .",
    "different methods to overcome the problem have been investigated in the literature .",
    "one method widely studied in economics and engineering is pricing @xcite .",
    "pricing can induce efficient use of network resources by internalizing negative externalities .",
    "although pricing has a solid theoretical foundation , implementing a pricing scheme can be impractical or cumbersome in some cases .",
    "let us consider a wireless internet service as an example .",
    "a service provider can limit access to its network resources by charging an access fee .",
    "however , charging an access fee requires a secure and reliable method to process payments , which creates burden on both sides of users and service providers .",
    "there also arises the issue of allocative fairness when a service provider charges for the internet service . in the presence of the income effect",
    ", pricing will bias the allocation of network resources towards users with high incomes .",
    "because the internet can play the role of an information equalizer , it has been argued in a public policy debate that access to the internet should be provided as a public good by a public authority rather than as a private good in a market @xcite .",
    "another method popular in game theory is to use repeated interaction @xcite .",
    "repeated interaction can encourage cooperative behavior by adjusting future payoffs depending on current behavior . a repeated game strategy can form a basis of an incentive scheme in which monitoring and punishment burden is decentralized to users ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , implementing a repeated game strategy requires repeated interaction among users , which may not be available .",
    "for example , users interacting in a mobile network change frequently in nature .    in this paper",
    ", we use an alternative method based on intervention , which was proposed in our previous work @xcite . in an incentive scheme based on intervention",
    ", a network is augmented with an intervention device that is able to monitor the actions of users and to take an action that affects the payoffs of users . in @xcite",
    ", we considered an ideal scenario where the intervention device can observe the actions of users without errors immediately after users choose their actions . in this paper , we consider a more realistic scenario where the intervention device can obtain only imperfect information about the actions of users and it takes time for the intervention device to collect signals .",
    "intervention directly affects the network usage of users , unlike pricing which uses an outside instrument to affect the payoffs of users .",
    "thus , an incentive scheme based on intervention can provide an effective and robust method to induce cooperation in that users can not avoid intervention as long as they use network resources .",
    "moreover , it does not require long - term relationship among users , which makes it applicable to networks with a dynamically changing user population .",
    "we consider a communication channel shared by @xmath0 users .",
    "time is divided into slots of equal length , and in each slot a user can attempt to transmit its packet or wait . if there is only one transmission attempt in a slot , the packet is successfully transmitted .",
    "if there is more than one transmission attempt in a slot , packets collide and no transmission is successful . for simplicity , we assume that each user can choose one of two transmission probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . note that each user choosing @xmath1 maximizes the total throughput , defined as the average number of successfully transmitted packets per time slot , assuming that all the users choose the same transmission probability @xcite .",
    "we consider a period consisting of @xmath4 consecutive time slots , and analyze interaction in the period without any consideration of past or future periods .",
    "we assume that the number of users and their transmission probabilities are fixed throughout a period .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of the users .",
    "the action space of user @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 , and the action of user @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath8 , for all @xmath9 .",
    "an action profile is represented by a vector @xmath10 .",
    "the payoff of user @xmath6 is given by the number of its successfully transmitted packets per time slot .",
    "then the expected payoff of user @xmath6 is given by the probability of its successful transmission , @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to see that the action @xmath2 is a dominant strategy for every user .",
    "hence , @xmath12 is the unique nash equilibrium , which yields the lower total throughput than the symmetric social optimum @xmath13 .    in order to improve the inefficiency of nash equilibrium",
    ", we introduce an intervention device in the system .",
    "the intervention device is capable of monitoring the actions of the users and interfering in the transmission of the users .",
    "the intervention device can sense the channel to learn whether the channel is idle ( i.e. , no user attempts to transmit its packet ) or busy ( i.e. , at least one user attempts to transmit its packet ) .",
    "we consider a scenario where the intervention device collects signals from sensing the channel for the first @xmath14 slots , where @xmath15 , and then chooses its transmission probability , which can be interpreted as the intervention level .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of all possible signals obtained in a slot .",
    "then the set of all possible signals that the intervention device can obtain for the @xmath14 slots is @xmath17 .",
    "the probability distribution of signals is independent across slots , and when the users choose action profile @xmath18 , the probability of obtaining an idle signal in a slot is given by @xmath19 .",
    "after obtaining @xmath14 signals , the intervention device chooses a transmission probability in @xmath20 $ ] , which remains fixed until the end of the period .",
    "we use subscript 0 for the intervention device .",
    "the action space of the intervention device is denoted by @xmath21 $ ] , and its action is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "the decision rule of the intervention device , called the intervention rule , can be represented by a function @xmath23 .",
    "since the transmission probabilities of the users do not change in a period , there is no gain for the intervention device to distinguish signals from different slots .",
    "hence , we focus on the class of intervention rules that use only the number of idle signals , which can be represented by @xmath24 .",
    "the probability that @xmath25 idle signals arise out of @xmath14 signals when the users choose action profile @xmath18 is @xmath26 , for @xmath27 .",
    "note that monitoring is imperfect in the sense that the intervention device can not observe the action profile of the users but obtains only imperfect information about the action profile .",
    "the sequence of events in a period can be listed as follows .    at the beginning of the period ,",
    "the users choose their transmission probabilities @xmath28 , which are used from slot 1 to slot @xmath4 , knowing the intervention rule @xmath29 adopted by the intervention device .",
    "the intervention device collects signals from slot 1 to slot @xmath14 .",
    "the intervention device intervenes using the transmission probability prescribed by the intervention rule @xmath29 from slot @xmath30 to slot @xmath4 .",
    "the payoff of user @xmath6 when the users choose action profile @xmath18 and the intervention device chooses action @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 the action profile of the users influences the probability distribution of signals , which in turn affects the action of the intervention device .",
    "the expected payoff of user @xmath6 when the users choose action profile @xmath18 and the intervention device uses intervention rule @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath33 a_i \\prod_{j \\in \\mathcal{n } \\setminus \\{i\\ } } ( 1-a_j).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath34 can be interpreted as the expected transmission probability of the intervention device , while @xmath35 is the weight on the slots in which the action of the intervention device affects the users .    for notation ,",
    "let us define @xmath36^k [ 1-(1-p_l)^n]^{t - k},\\\\ \\mu(k;t ) & = \\binom{t}{k } [ ( 1-p_l)^{n-1}(1-p_h)]^k [ 1-(1-p_l)^{n-1}(1-p_h)]^{t - k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath27 , and let @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the probability of @xmath25 idle signals arising out of @xmath14 signals when every user cooperates ( i.e. , chooses @xmath1 ) , while @xmath40 is that when exactly one user defects ( i.e. , chooses @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath41 is the cooperation throughput that each user obtains when all the users choose @xmath1 , while @xmath42 is the defection throughput that a user obtains when it deviates to @xmath2 unilaterally .",

    "exerting intervention is necessary to punish a deviation , but at the same time intervention incurs efficiency loss under imperfect monitoring .",
    "therefore , the manager wants to use the minimum possible intervention level while providing the incentive for cooperation .",
    "the left - hand side of the incentive constraint is the expected loss from deviation due to the change in the probability distribution of signals induced by deviation , while the right - hand side is the gain from deviation .",

    ". then there exists a feasible solution , say @xmath29 , that satisfies the incentive constraint with equality .",
    "define the likelihood ratio of @xmath29 by @xmath73 then the objective value in at @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath74 hence , the objective value decreases as @xmath29 has a larger likelihood ratio . to optimize the objective value",
    ", @xmath29 should put the probabilities on the signals starting from signal 0 to signal 1 , and so on , until the incentive constraint is satisfied with equality .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , that is associated with the unique optimal solution .    since a smaller number of idle signals gives a higher likelihood ratio , an intervention rule yields a smaller efficiency loss when intervention is exerted following a smaller number of idle signals .",
    "put differently , signal @xmath25 provides a stronger indication of defection as @xmath25 is smaller .",
    "however , using only signal 0 may not be sufficient to provide the incentive for cooperation , in which case other signals need to be used as well .",
    "using signal @xmath25 with @xmath66 contributes to provide the incentive for cooperation , although the `` quality '' of the signal decreases as @xmath25 increases .",
    "hence , it is optimal for the manager to use signals with small @xmath25 primarily , which yields a threshold @xmath75 .",
    "so far we have analyzed the problem of designing an intervention rule when the total number of signals , @xmath14 , is fixed .",
    "now we consider a scenario where the manager can choose @xmath14 as well as an intervention rule . in this scenario , there are two counteracting effects of increasing @xmath14 .",
    "first , note that the objective value in can be expressed as @xmath77 \\tau_c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that increasing @xmath14 affects the objective value only through @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath62 is increasing in @xmath14 , we can achieve a larger likelihood ratio @xmath78 with larger @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , as the intervention device collects more signals , the information becomes more accurate ( quality effect ) . on the other hand , increasing @xmath14 decreases the weight given on the slots in which intervention is applied , which makes the incentive constraint harder to satisfy ( delay effect ) .",
    "let @xmath79 be the optimal value of the design problem ",
    ", where we set @xmath80 if there is no feasible solution with @xmath14 .",
    "the problem of finding an optimal number of signals can be written as @xmath81 .",
    "in general , @xmath79 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath14 , and we provide a numerical example to illustrate the result .",
    "we consider system parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "then we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the numerical results show that the lp problem is infeasible for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . with @xmath88 ,",
    "there is not sufficient information based on which intervention can provide the incentive for cooperation . with @xmath89 , the delay effect is dominant , which prevents the incentive constraint to be satisfied .",
    "figure  [ fig : dura ] plots @xmath79 for @xmath90 .",
    "we can see that @xmath79 is non - monotonic while reaching the maximum at @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "in the plot , the dotted line represents the total throughput at @xmath13 , @xmath93 .",
    "the difference between @xmath79 and @xmath93 can be interpreted as the efficiency loss due to imperfect monitoring .",
    "lastly , we note that @xmath75 in proposition 1 is non - decreasing in @xmath14 , with @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 for @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for @xmath101 .     for @xmath90.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we have studied the problem of designing incentive schemes based on the idea of intervention to sustain cooperation among users sharing network resources in the case of imperfect monitoring .",
    "we have used a simple model to present the main ideas and results without too many complications .",
    "our model can be extended in several directions , among which we mention two .",
    "first , users can use more complicated decision rules than the one choosing one of two transmission probabilities .",
    "the action space for a user can be relaxed to @xmath20 $ ] instead of @xmath102 .",
    "also , users can have an ability to monitor the actions of other users and the intervention device .",
    "in such a scenario , we can study intervention rules to sustain a cooperative decision rule , where a decision rule for a user is a mapping from its information set to its action space .",
    "second , the set of signals that the intervention device can obtain in a slot can be generalized .",
    "for example , a signal can be ternary ( idle , success , collision ) or the number of users that attempted to transmit .",
    "we can investigate how optimal intervention rules and their performance change as the intervention device obtains finer information about the actions of users .",
    "finally , we conclude with a remark that incentive schemes based on intervention can be applied to a wide range of networks where cooperative behavior should be encouraged .",
    "potential applications include communication networks ( power control , congestion control , and medium access control ) and peer - to - peer networks ."
