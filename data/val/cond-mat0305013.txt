    "many recent studies have focused on the surprising thermodynamic properties associated with the hydration of hydrophobic substances in aqueous solutions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the heat capacity of non - polar solutes in water is large and positive at room temperature .",
    "this behavior , known as the `` hydrophobic heat - capacity anomaly '' , stands in sharp contrast to the observations made for hydrophilic solutes in water  @xcite .",
    "experiments confirm that the solubility of small hydrocarbons in water decreases when the solution is heated near room temperature .",
    "it is generally believed that these thermodynamic phenomena are associated with a structural change in the solvent , and the hydrophobic effect is therefore considered as directly related to the anomalous properties of liquid water  @xcite .    due to hydrogen bonds between molecules ,",
    "pure water is highly structured . adding a non - polar solute , which is unable to form hydrogen bonds ,",
    "disrupts the structural arrangement by breaking bonds , thus raising the enthalpy of the solution and increasing considerably the entropy . because the entropy change dominates over the enthalpy change at room temperature ,",
    "the hydration process is considered to be `` entropy driven '' .",
    "although this intuitive interpretation provides a first understanding of the hydrophobic effect , it still suffers from a number of limitations .",
    "in contrast to the expected increase in enthalpy due to the breaking of hydrogen bonds , the process of transferring a non - polar particle to water from the liquid state in pure solute is found experimentally to be enthalpically even slightly favorable ( negative ) , at least at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained only by a rearrangement of the water molecules in the vicinity of the solute , resulting in a recovery of the lost hydrogen bonds which tend to be slightly stronger than before  @xcite .",
    "this new structure , however , causes an entropy loss attributed to an increase in local order .",
    "measurements of the entropy and enthalpy changes for different solute sizes suggest that this local ordering of water molecules around the hydrophobic particle is not unique , but that a number of different organizations is possible  @xcite .",
    "hence , the anomalous thermodynamic properties are a consequence of changes in the state of water molecules due to the insertion of hydrophobic solute particles , rather than being accounted for by water - solute interactions .    at room temperature the solubility of small , hydrophobic solute species in water increases when the system is cooled . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "a homogeneous mixture is found , provided that none of the components crystallizes .",
    "heating the mixture produces a decrease in solubility , which can result in a phase transition to a state with two phases of different solute densities .",
    "this transition temperature is called the lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) , and has been measured for different solutions of hydrophobic particles in water  @xcite . after reaching a minimum , the solubility increases steeply at higher temperatures .",
    "if a coexistence of two phases is found near room temperature , another phase transition to one homogeneous phase occurs at the upper critical solution temperature ( ucst ) , on condition that the boiling point of the solution is not reached  @xcite .",
    "aqueous solutions of non - polar particles which show a lcst also have an ucst and therefore a closed - loop coexistence curve in the phase diagram , provided that none of the liquids undergoes a phase transition to a gaseous phase before that temperature is reached .",
    "this occurs because the rising temperature increases the entropy , which favors a homogeneous mixing of the components .",
    "in addition , the number of hydrogen bonds formed , which is responsible for the phase separation , decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this type of closed - loop miscibility curve has been found in different binary solutions including nicotine / water and poly(ethylene glycol)/water  @xcite , as well as by modeling of binary mixtures containing hydrogen - bonded molecules  @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the hydrophobic effect is essential in order to explain a variety of phenomena , including the aggregation of hydrophobic solutes in water and the destabilization , denaturation and aggregation of proteins , processes which are responsible for many life - sustaining processes but also for different diseases  @xcite .",
    "aggregation of non - polar particles in aqueous solutions can be attributed to the effective hydrophobic interaction between solute particles .",
    "this interaction is mainly solvent - induced , because the approach of two hydrophobic solute particles reduces the surface exposed to water compared with the total surface when they are completely separated . however , despite its importance for the understanding of a number of still - unexplained phenomena , the study of hydrophobic aggregation is at present incomplete and needs further investigation . in this work",
    "we describe and analyze solutions of hydrophobic particles , particularly in the vicinity of the aggregation phase transition , using a simple two - state model in three dimensions .",
    "the results of a mean - field calculation are compared to monte carlo simulations .",
    "in addition , the model is extended to include the effect of a chaotropic substance in the solution , which causes an increase in solubility of the non - polar solute for reasons which are at present not well understood .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the model used for a detailed description of the solution . in section",
    "iii a mean - field calculation is performed , giving a first idea of the phase diagram near the aggregation transition .",
    "monte carlo simulations confirming these findings are presented in section iv . in section v the model is adapted to describe the chaotropic effect .",
    "finally , section vi offers a discussion of the results , as well as some suggestions for further investigations .",
    "in order to describe the interaction between hydrophobic solutes and water , a simple model which describes the essential physics of the system is required .",
    "it is generally believed that the driving force in the aggregation process is the effective repulsive hydrophobic interaction between the polar water and non - polar solute  @xcite . as early as 1945 , frank and",
    "evans  @xcite noted that this interaction arises from a cage - like arrangement of water molecules around the solute , which allows them to optimize their mutual hydrogen bonding and thus to minimize their energy with respect to bulk liquid water .",
    "entropically , however , this strict ordering is unfavorable compared with the disordered configurations in bulk water .    the minimal model which contains the essential features of the physics of water as an aqueous",
    "solvent is the bimodal description of muller , lee , and graziano ( mlg )  @xcite .",
    "the model describes liquid water by dividing it into two different populations based on the number of hydrogen bonds formed .",
    "water molecules which are highly hydrogen - bonded to their neighbors have fewer rotational degrees of freedom and thus a lower multiplicity of degenerate configurations ( lower entropy ) than unbonded molecules .",
    "these are therefore denoted as `` ordered '' , while water molecules with many broken hydrogen bonds are considered to be `` disordered '' .",
    "the presence of a non - polar solute alters the enthalpy and entropy of water molecules in the solvation shell of each solute particle , and so a further distinction is required between `` shell '' and `` bulk '' water .",
    "more details of the physical processes underlying these considerations are provided below .",
    "this simple model has been justified recently from molecular simulations of water  @xcite .    in this form",
    "the mlg model reproduces correctly the ordering and strengthening of the hydrogen bonds in the first solvation shell of an added non - polar solute molecule at low temperatures , as well as the opposite behavior at high temperatures .",
    "it has been shown that the model provides an adequate description of the heat - capacity anomaly  @xcite , and it has been used to reproduce consistently the important properties of protein solutions , including warm and cold denaturation  @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we use an adapted version of the mlg model",
    ". an appropriate description of the solvent in the vicinty of hydrophobic solute particles which may be much larger than individual water molecules is obtained by allowing each site of a lattice representing the system to be occupied by a group of water molecules .",
    "the bimodal nature of the mlg model is preserved in this coarse - grained version by specifying only two types of water cluster at each site , where now an `` ordered '' site is characterized by having most of the hydrogen bonds among the molecules in the cluster intact , while a `` disordered '' site is understood to have a number ( but by no means all ) of these bonds broken . while this is the simplest possible approximation to the continuous distribution of intact or broken bonds within a site",
    ", we will demonstrate that it retains the capability of describing all the primary physical properties observed in aqueous solutions of non - polar solutes .",
    "the energy and degeneracy parameters for the coarse - grained model are determined by the same processes as in the bare mlg description outlined above , which we now discuss in more detail .",
    "an approximation where a group of water molecules is considered as one entity is justified when the non - polar solute particle is relatively large compared with a single water molecule . in this case",
    "the formation of a complete cage around the solute particle is rather improbable because it must be formed rapidly in the presence of local thermal fluctuations , and may even be prevented sterically  @xcite .",
    "partial cages may therefore be formed in the vicinity of a solute particle , rather than one complete cage .",
    "in addition , formation of a hydrogen bond promotes the formation of further hydrogen bonds , which are stronger than before due to the change in charge distribution on forming the first bond  @xcite .",
    "this mutual reinforcement is known as `` cooperativity '' of hydrogen bonds , and leads to the formation of chains or clusters of hydrogen - bonded water molecules , whose extent depends on the size and the shape of the solute particles .",
    "water molecules which participate in hydrogen - bonded clusters have a higher degree of order and fewer rotational degrees of freedom than those in regions with many unbonded molecules  @xcite .",
    "the number of possible configurations of such an `` ordered '' cluster is thus significantly smaller than that of a `` disordered '' group of water molecules for both shell and bulk water . for steric reasons , fewer hydrogen - bonded water configurations",
    "are possible around a non - polar solute particle which is unable to form hydrogen bonds .",
    "these shell water molecules are forced into a tangential orientation  @xcite , whereas the molecules in bulk water may also form radially oriented hydrogen bonds with central water molecules replacing the solute  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy , or total number of configurations , of a hydrogen - bonded cluster of shell water ( `` ordered shell '' ) is consequently smaller than that of a hydrogen - bonded cluster of bulk water ( `` ordered bulk '' ) .",
    "in contrast , fewer orientational configurations exist for unbonded water molecules in the bulk than next to a non - polar solute particle  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical reason for this result is that for a shell site no hydrogen bonds are possible in direction of the solute particle , unlike the bulk situation obtained on replacing the solute particle by water .",
    "all orientations in which water molecules form radial hydrogen bonds with the central water in the bulk case ( contributing to the ordered bulk degeneracy ) are therefore transformed into configurations with many broken hydrogen bonds when the central water is replaced by a non - polar solute particle .",
    "we take such sites to be `` disordered '' in the bimodal sense discussed above .",
    "the degeneracy of a group of water molecules with many broken hydrogen bonds is then higher in the shell ( `` disordered shell '' ) than in the bulk ( `` disordered bulk '' ) .    in summary ,",
    "these considerations lead to a distribution of the total number of states @xmath0 according to the sequence @xmath1 .",
    "because many fewer configurations have intact than broken hydrogen bonds , the difference in degeneracy between ordered and disordered states is much higher than that between shell and bulk states for both types of site .",
    "in fact the difference in degeneracy between shell and bulk states depends primarily on the number of possible radial hydrogen bonds , which is much smaller than the total number . in much of what follows",
    "we employ the degeneracy factors @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "these relative values are chosen to be qualitatively representative of the degeneracies expected for a system of small solute particles in water , with both experimental and theoretical  @xcite justification based on the above properties of water .",
    "we note here that , while it is known that a number of ordered states exists even for the cage - like water structures coordinating dissolved solute particles , the absolute multiplicities of the @xmath0 factors contribute only an additive constant to the free energy and are irrelevant for the phenomena to be discussed below ; thus we set the lowest degeneracy to @xmath4 .        fig .  [ figmlg ] shows the schematic energy levels of a group of water molecules in the coarse - grained mlg - type model .",
    "the hydrogen - bond energy is optimized in the ordered , cage - like shell structure where strong , tangentially oriented hydrogen bonds are formed among water molecules in the cluster ( `` ordered shell '' ) , and hence @xmath5 is lowest .",
    "direct experimental evidence for the tangential orientation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the solvation shell of non - polar solute particles has been provided recently in refs .",
    "when the solute particle is replaced by water , radial hydrogen bonds may be formed .",
    "however , clusters including radially oriented water molecules have on average a higher hydrogen - bond energy than those whose bonds are predominantly tangentially oriented , because for steric reasons a radial hydrogen bond precludes another good tangential hydrogen bond to a first - shell neighbor .",
    "this result was demonstrated in a model including oriented hydrogen bonds between water molecules  @xcite . in bulk water , both configurations are possible , and thus the average energy in a cluster of hydrogen - bonded bulk water @xmath6 ( `` ordered bulk '' ) is higher than @xmath5 .",
    "the energies @xmath7 ( `` disordered shell '' ) and @xmath8 ( `` disordered bulk '' ) are relatively much higher than those of the respective ordered states , because breaking of hydrogen bonds is required in forming the disordered states .",
    "the average hydrogen - bond energy of a group of disordered shell water molecules decreases when the solute particle is replaced by water , because some radial hydrogen bonds broken by the solute may be formed , lowering the average energy of the group and ensuring that @xmath9 .",
    "specific determination of the energy values for a selected binary system would require structural calculations and molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite . however , such refinement is not necessary for the general phenomena to be illustrated below .",
    "we note here that the temperature scale @xmath10 is defined by the energy scale . in the following we use the parameter values @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , which are thought to be quite generic for aqueous systems , and furthermore agree closely with the energies used in a successful description of the thermodynamic behavior of biopolymers in water  @xcite . while the results of the calculations to follow are not particularly sensitive to the exact values selected , it remains possible to refine these parameters by comparison with experiment to obtain good qualitative agreement with measured quantities for different solutions .    on a cubic lattice the energy of a system of @xmath13 sites ,",
    "occupied either by particles ( @xmath14 ) or by water ( @xmath15 ) , is given by the potts - like hamiltonian @xmath16 & = & \\sum_{i=1}^n n_i[(e_{os } \\tilde\\delta_{i , \\sigma_{os } } + e_{ds } \\tilde\\delta_{i , \\sigma_{ds}})(1-\\lambda_i ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( e_{ob } \\tilde\\delta_{i , \\sigma_{ob } } + e_{db } \\tilde\\delta_{i , \\sigma_{db } } ) \\lambda_i ] , \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is @xmath18 if site @xmath19 is surrounded only by water , is @xmath20 otherwise , and is defined as the product of the nearest - neighbor factors , @xmath21 .",

    "is to consider that its addition to strongly hydrogen - bonded , `` ordered '' clusters creates `` disordered '' clusters with additional broken hydrogen bonds and higher net energy .",
    "the creation of disordered states from ordered ones in the presence of a chaotropic cosolvent increases the degeneracy of the former at the expense of the latter .    because the coarse - grained model treats each water site as containing a number of water molecules , the cosolvent molecules , which are generally rather small in comparison with the hydrophobic particles ,",

    "the effect of a chaotropic cosolvent is much stronger in the bulk than in the shell .",
    "while in ordered , bulk water both tangentially and radially oriented hydrogen bonds may be broken , in shell water there exist no radially oriented bonds , and the ordered bulk configurations with radially oriented water have already become disordered configurations on substitution of the central water by a non - polar solute particle .",

    "clusters of aggregated , hydrophobic solute molecules with density @xmath75 are suspended in nearly pure water ( density @xmath172 ) .",

    "the effective interaction between non - polar particles becomes attractive above @xmath62 , and therefore the formation of aggregates is preferred over the solution of single solute particles .",
    "further heating of the system results in a second phase transition at the temperature @xmath63 where the hydrophobic particles disaggregate , and above this temperature one homogeneous phase is found .",
    "this process is dominated by the favorable entropy change of solvation in the whole system .    as can be seen from the @xmath35-@xmath60 phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ figmut ] , the transition line for the monte carlo simulations and the mean - field calculation correspond rather well .",
    "they agree closely on the lower critical point , as well as on the densities above and below the transition temperatures . the upper critical point determined by monte carlo ,",

    "this result is not surprising , because it is well known that mean - field calculations , which neglect fluctuation effects , generally overestimate transition temperatures .",
    "the good agreement at low temperatures is rather a signature of the predominance of local effects which do not involve large fluctuations from site to site .",
    "apart from this difference , the coexistence curves from monte carlo and the mean - field calculations are qualitatively similar . at very low temperatures , however , the former show an additional crystal phase which can not be explained by the latter , because it arises from spatial ordering of the hydrophobic solute and is therefore neglected by the present mean - field considerations , although this phase could be recovered within a more refined mean - field approximation .",
    "the appearance of this phase confirms the prediction of our analytical calculation at @xmath49 .      encouraged by the qualitative and quantitative agreement of the mean - field calculation and monte carlo simulations , we have taken experimental values for the critical density @xmath141 in different systems to adapt the parameters of our model .",
    "analytically , we have obtained the relation @xmath173 by mean - field calculations , and have confirmed this numerically by monte carlo simulations .",

    "this coordination number @xmath174 may be interpreted as the average number of hydrophobic solute molecules surrounding any chosen solute particle , which is relevant for the net effective hydrophobic interaction leading to attraction or repulsion . after changing the values for the energy levels to @xmath177 , and @xmath178 ,",

    "we have repeated this procedure for the system poly(ethylene glycol ) in water , which has a critical density of @xmath183 and a much larger molecular weight @xmath184  @xcite , and which resulted in a similar agreement with the experimental curve .",
    "in addition to studying hydrophobic solutes in pure water , we have analyzed the effect of a chaotropic substance in the solution .",
    "the destabilizing effect can be attributed indirectly to a disordering of water molecules by chaotropic cosolvents associated with a rearrangement of the energy states of the water . as a first approximation",
