    "@xcite , however , the strength of the bragg scattering was measured by monitoring the variations of the light intensity in the laser beams by homodyne detection .",
    "due to the correspondence between the light - stimulated scattering of photons between the laser beams and the atoms scattered between two momentum states , the intensity fluctuations are directly proportional to the number of atoms scattered between the condensate fragments .",

    "this establishes an optical weak link between the two becs , and continuous monitoring of the intensity fluctuations in the laser beams measures the phase coherence between the becs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    saba _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the light intensity variations of the bragg beams which revealed relative phase coherence between the condensates even when the becs were independently produced and possessed no a priori phase information . by analyzing theoretically a continuous atom detection process",
    "it has been previously shown that the back - action of quantum measurement of the atomic correlations @xcite , and analogous photon correlations @xcite , can establish a relative phase between two becs even when they have ` never seen each other ' before .",
    "it has also been suggested that phase - coherent states of condensates may naturally emerge as robust state descriptions due to dissipative interaction with the environment @xcite . with regards to the bragg spectroscopic interferometer of @xcite ,",
    "the question we ask is : _ how is the phase coherence between the two becs created , given the condensates interact with coherent laser beams that can usually be described classically ? _    here we analyze a model of the experimental detection scheme  @xcite , illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup ] , and show that the phase coherence can be built up by continuously monitoring the photo - current obtained by a homodyne measurement that describes the intensity fluctuations of the laser beams .",
    "we show a rapid establishment of a well - defined relative phase between two independently produced becs .",
    "we identify two distinct regimes of subsequent phase evolution : a running phase and a trapped phase regime . in the running phase regime",
    "the relative phase grows linearly proportional to the energy offset between the two condensate wells and could be suitable for a weak force detection in interferometric applications @xcite . in the trapped phase regime ,",
    "in the case of a very weak energy offset , the measurement process drives the system close to a dark state where a destructive interference between different scattering paths suppresses the intensity fluctuations of the lasers . in the trapped phase regime",
    "the effect of the energy offset on the phase evolution is suppressed , potentially to the detriment of interferometric applications .",
    "our analysis demonstrates how bragg spectroscopy can be sensitive to subtle quantum features of ultracold atom systems .",
    "quantum measurement - induced back - action of the photo - current detection on the relative phase coherence of the becs represents a spatially non - local entanglement of the laser beams and the relative many - particle state of the atoms . indeed , the location of the photo - current detection can be far separated from the interaction region of the coherent laser beams and the atoms . moreover ,",
    "one bragg pulse can be used to entangle the two spatially isolated becs . a second pulse",
    "may then be employed in optical readout of the subsequent evolution dynamics of the measurement - established relative phase coherence between the condensates .",
    "an energy offset between the two condensate wells between the subsequent pulses would result in a detectable phase shift providing potential interferometric applications @xcite . here",
    "the phase is determined by a continuous quantum measurement process opening possibilities for quantum feedback and control methods , e.g. , in generation of sub - shot - noise phase - squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "such states may be useful in quantum - enhanced metrology in the realization of a high - precision quantum interferometer overcoming the standard quantum limit of classical interferometers @xcite .",
    "probe field response was also recently measured in bragg spectroscopy of condensate excitations in a heterodyne - based detection system , which was able to reach the shot - noise limit  @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the effects of continuous monitoring on light scattered from becs have considered photon counting @xcite , e.g. , in preparation of macroscopic superposition states @xcite , and dispersive phase - contrast imaging @xcite , e.g. , in suppression of heating @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we give a short review of the experimental setup of @xcite and the relevant results for this work .",
    "we then introduce our basic theoretical model . in section  [ contmeas ]",
    "we derive a stochastic differential equation which describes the evolution of the system under the continuous measurement of the scattered light intensity . in section  [ numres ]",
    "we present our numerical results with a physical interpretation .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section  [ sum ] .",
    "an interferometric scheme between two spatially isolated becs was experimentally realized in @xcite without the need for splitting or recombining the two condensate atom clouds .",
    "the method was based on stimulated light scattering of a small fraction of the atoms , only weakly perturbing the condensates and therefore representing an almost nondestructive measurement .",
    "two isolated becs were prepared in the sites of an unbalanced double - well potential , and illuminated by the same pair of bragg beams . these beams outcoupled atoms from each well , and",
    "interference between such atoms provided a coupling between the becs .",
    "when outcoupled atoms from one condensate spatially overlapped the second , measurement of the bragg beam intensity was shown to be sensitive to the relative phase @xmath3 between the condensates .",
    "in addition , the potential offset between the two wells gave rise to a difference in energies @xmath4 , which in turn led to a relative phase evolution @xmath5 .",
    "this was observed as oscillations in the bragg beam intensity of frequency @xmath6 , demonstrating how monitoring the bragg beam intensity directly measured the dynamical evolution of the relative phase between the macroscopic wavefunctions .    in the experiment",
    "a single bragg pulse established a random relative phase between the two independently produced becs . if two successive bragg pulses were applied to the same bec pair the relative phase measured by the second pulse was correlated with that detected by the first pulse , indicating that the interaction of the first bragg beam with the atoms had projected the system into a state with a well - defined relative phase between the condensates .",
    "the key to the method is the weak link established between the becs by the bragg laser beams that couple out small atomic samples from the condensates @xcite .",
    "the coherently driven population dynamics between the becs is influenced by the relative phase coherence  @xcite , and the bragg scattering may be understood as an interference in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "the specific advantage of the bragg spectroscopic interference scheme @xcite is the nondestructive nature of the detection process , potentially constituting a major advance for interferometric applications since it allows one to probe the evolution of the phase coherence in time by a continuous measurement process @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that this setup can be seen as an analog to homodyne detection for matter waves @xcite .    in order to analyze the continuous measurement process of bragg spectroscopy we consider the system depicted in figure  [ fig : setup ] that is analogous to the experimental set - up of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the two condensates are initially uncorrelated and that there is no tunnelling between the two spatial regions . as in the experiment ,",
    "an offset in the trapping potential between the two condensates is accounted for by a difference in chemical potential , @xmath7 .",
    "the condensates are illuminated by two bragg beams , which impart momentum , kicking atoms out of the traps .",
    "the outcoupled atoms propagate from the left condensate to the right and establish an optical weak link between the two macroscopic wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , in the theoretical analysis we use a single mode approximation for the condensates and assume that all atoms in the left ( right ) condensate are in the state @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "we take the wavefunction of the outcoupled atoms @xmath2 to be the momentum shifted original wavefunction @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 gives the position of the centre of the left ( right ) trap .",
    "we assume that the momentum kick of the atoms is sufficiently strong , so that the essential characteristics of the continuous quantum measurement process are not obscured by collisions with the remaining trapped atoms , collisions among the outcoupled atoms , and the effect of the trapping potential .",
    "we assume that enough time has passed such that the outcoupled atom cloud from the left condensate completely overlaps the right condensate .",
    "we hence neglect the time evolution of the outcoupled cloud while flying from the left to the right trap . in our model",
    ", this evolution leads to an additional phase factor which is inconsequential to our findings .",

    ". no well - defined relative phase exists at early times , the coherence starts at zero and @xmath97 shows large random fluctuations with time .",
    "as the continuous measurement proceeds the coherence builds rapidly , leading to a well - defined relative phase with a stable value .",
    "once established , we then see two different regimes of behaviour at longer times . for large values of the detuning",
    "@xmath99 we see a running phase behaviour : once well established with a value which is random for each individual run , the phase grows linearly in time with a rate proportional to the difference in energies between the condensates @xmath100 . from ( [ eqn : imeas ] ) we note that the measured photocurrent from the two bragg beams is essentially proportional to the quadrature @xmath101 after subtracting the background current , and the corresponding time evolution of @xmath101 is shown in figure  [ fig : x1 ] . in the running phase regime , the quadrature exhibits well defined oscillations with frequency @xmath102 , and this corresponds to the experimental measurements obtained by saba _",
    "such oscillations thus give an interferometric measurement of the relative phase evolution , sensitive to any accumulated phase shift due to an energy offset between the distant condensates .",
    "an interferometer of this type could be used , for example , to detect a weak force applied to one of the condensates .",
    "choosing a smaller value for the detuning @xmath103 we find a very different long time behaviour .",
    "once again the phase fluctuates as coherence is established , although this occurs on a much faster timescale .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the phase is established as a result of the intensity fluctuations in the laser beams , which are enhanced by decreasing the detuning @xmath26 .",
    "unlike the running phase case , once firmly established the phase now locks to an almost constant value near to @xmath104 .",
    "this trapped phase state has the two condensates almost entirely out of phase , leading to destructive interference in the oscillations between the states @xmath30 and @xmath9 and resulting in a state analogous to a dark - state .",
    "the corresponding quadrature @xmath105 therefore exhibits merely random fluctuations which would not be suited to an interferometric type experiment .",
    "note that while one would expect the amplitude of these random fluctuations to be suppressed compared to the coherent oscillations of the running phase regime , and this is indeed the case , the two different values of detunings used here do not allow such a direct comparison in figure  [ fig : x1 ] .",
    "the two different regimes of behaviour resemble the ac - josephson and self - trapping behaviours seen in double - well condensates  @xcite , although we emphasize that here the coupling occurs due to the non - local measurement process induced by the bragg beams .",
    "the trapped phase behaviour is more akin to a dark state , however , due to the lack of any nonlinearity in the hamiltonian which is required for macroscopic self - trapping .",
    "the different regimes may be understood if we assume that a well defined phase and population can be associated with each condensate , and neglect any processes other than those included in @xmath106 , leaving a two - mode model similar to that considered in @xcite .",
    "the trapped phase regime then occurs with a stable relative phase difference of @xmath104 when @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the relative population difference , where @xmath109 is the population in state @xmath110 .",
    "the trapped phase regime therefore requires either @xmath111 , or a large population imbalance .",
    "this is in agreement with our results , where the larger value of detuning has @xmath112 , and the initial population balance is not extreme . the trapped phase condition is then not satisfied and we observe a running phase behaviour akin to the ac - josephson effect .",
    "note , however , that the dissipation is vital for establishing the relative phase in the first place , and has the effect of shifting the relative phase in the trapped regime away from @xmath104 in figure  [ fig : coherence ] .",
    "the model ( [ eq : darkstatecondition ] ) does not specify the role of spontaneous scattering which determines the rate at which the system is driven towards the trapped phase state .",

    "our results show no significant dependence on atom number , however , and we expect our results to give a good qualitative comparison with the physics exhibited in the experiment .",
    "we have so far discussed our results in dimensionless units ; in order to give a specific example we may take @xmath115 to be of the order of @xmath116 , for instance .",

    "parameters used in the experiment of @xcite were @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "this yields a ratio @xmath122 . in order for the trapped phase regime to be observed the population imbalance would then be required to satisfy @xmath123 . in the experiment ,",
    "the actual population in the momentum shifted state ( @xmath30 ) that overlapped the second condensate ( @xmath9 ) was of the order of @xmath124 atoms during the coupling .",
    "the corresponding population imbalance was in excess of @xmath125 , and hence did not satisfy condition ( [ eq : darkstatecondition ] ) for the trapped phase behaviour .",
    "the observed running phase behaviour in the experiment is therefore consistent with our model .",
    "bragg spectroscopy was used in @xcite to measure the relative phase between two initially uncorrelated becs . by studying a simplified model containing the essential ingredients of the experiment ,",
    "we have demonstrated how the homodyne measurement process builds up a coherent relative phase between the two condensates .",
    "this quantum measurement - induced backaction entangles the two macroscopic many - body states even though the measurement location can be far removed from the region of interactions .",
    "following the establishment of a coherent phase , we have identified two distinct behaviours under continual subsequent measurement . with a larger atom - laser detuning @xmath26 , or a large initial energy imbalance @xmath7 , we reproduce the experimental findings of @xcite , with the measured photon flux exhibiting oscillations at a frequency corresponding to the energy offset of the separated condensates . in this case , once the coherence and a random - valued phase is established it evolves linearly in time @xmath126 .",
    "measurable oscillations in the laser beam intensity mean this state has applications to quantum - enhanced interferometry , and the measurement backaction could potentially be used further to implement feedback mechanisms  @xcite . by choosing a smaller atom - laser detuning , we found instead that the system stabilized to a trapped phase state with the condensate relative phase fixed at almost @xmath104 , while the scattered light intensity showed only random fluctuations .",
    "a semiclassical model can qualitatively describe the difference between these two regimes , with the trapped phase behaviour occurring when ( [ eq : darkstatecondition ] ) was satisfied .",
    "when atoms from two initially uncorrelated condensates overlap , we have shown that bragg coupling and continuous homodyne measurement can rapidly establish a well - defined relative phase .",
    "a closely related experiment  @xcite has been performed using ultra - slow light pulses , in which optical information was coherently transported between two spatially separated condensates by a travelling matter wave .",
    "an ultra - slow light pulse was stopped in the first condensate , creating a dark - state superposition between two atomic internal states . upon stopping the pulse one of the internal states",
    "received a momentum kick , and outcoupled atoms in this state passed through a second distant condensate . by illuminating the second condensate with a coupling laser it was possible to revive the initial light pulse , even when the becs were independently produced . in the case where the condensates had been prepared separately , a rapid establishment of a coherent phase in a manner similar to that",
