    "the time - dependence of these solutions appears as a fundamental ingredient that allows singularities to be avoided , in contrast to static solutions of the ekg equations with real scalar fields , where singularities frequently appear .",

    "however , the stability of oscillatons has not been studied in as much detail as in the case of boson stars  @xcite .",

    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that the function @xmath67 does not behave as an outgoing wave at the boundary .",

    "in particular , the outgoing wave boundary condition applied to @xmath0 can be seen to imply that at the boundary : @xmath75 this equation can then be used to obtain boundary values for @xmath67 once those of @xmath0 and @xmath31 are known .",
    "finally , we need to mention the boundary conditions used for the ordinary differential equations that have to be solved to find the metric functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for @xmath21 , we use the fact that local flatness implies that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "these two conditions imply that @xmath78 .",
    "we use these two boundary values at the first two grid points and integrate the second order hamiltonian constraint outwards .    for the lapse function",

    "we then assume that our boundaries are sufficiently far away as to be always in a vacuum , and impose @xmath79 as an outer boundary condition .",
    "the slicing condition is then integrated inwards .",
    "one could presumably improve on this by setting @xmath80 , @xmath81 as boundary conditions on the origin , integrating the slicing condition outwards , and then re - scaling it so that the lapse goes as @xmath82 far away ( @xmath83 is a constant ; notice that the slicing condition is scale invariant ) .      in order to illustrate how all these ingredients work together properly , we study now the accuracy of our numerical methods in some particular cases . in figure",
    "[ fig : convergence ] we show the convergence of a system initially consisting of a gaussian pulse of scalar field .",

    "what we show in the plot is the @xmath86 norm of the value of @xmath87 across the grid as a function of time for three different resolutions .",
    "the initial gaussian corresponds to an oscillaton with @xmath88 , so that it is in the stable branch and has a long time life ; the boundary is located at @xmath89 so that the evolutions were carried out up to 100 crossing times .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath87 goes down by a factor of 4 every time the resolution is doubled shows that the code remains second order convergent .",

    "this latter fact again confirms the stability and final state - status of s - oscillatons .",
    "another particular characteristic of u - oscillatons is that the formation of a black hole is very likely if the original profile is perturbed by adding mass to it .",
    "this phenomenon occurs even if the perturbed initial mass is less than the critical one , so that the gravitational cooling mechanism is not efficient at all in the u - branch .",
    "now we take a closer look at the equilibrium configurations near the critical profile , the one being the most massive in figs .",
    "[ fig : mass_s ] , which we shall call the s - u transition point .    to begin with ,",
    "let us recall the basic characteristics of the s , u - branches .",
    "the basic imprint of s - branch oscillatons is that they are stable and then oscillate around the initial profiles when slightly perturbed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsr_ec ] . on the other hand ,",
    "u - branch oscillatons are intrinsically unstable and they migrate to the s - branch even when slightly perturbed , like those cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsr ] .    the evolution of the profiles near the s - u transition point when slightly perturbed are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsr_su ] .",
    "we observe that the results summarized above are again confirmed , and then the critical configuration characterizes the transition between the s and u branches under _ small _ perturbations .",
    "we have also found the same results in the case of strong perturbations .",
    "if the mass of these oscillatons is decreased , they migrate to s - oscillatons .",
    "if the mass is increased even by a small amount , they collapse rapidly forming black holes .",
    "that u - oscillatons form black holes is not surprising .",
    "the fact that s - oscillatons can also collapse to black holes near the critical point is a consequence of the inefficiency of the gravitational cooling mechanism in the case of dense s - oscillatons , as it was found in section  [ four : i ] .",
    "actually , if the mass of an s - oscillaton near the transition point is perturbed to be larger than @xmath128 , it will collapse into black holes ; otherwise , it will migrate to more diluted configurations .",
    "that is , the value @xmath129 can be seen as the true critical value in the s - u transition region .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the critical oscillaton ( @xmath130 ) marks the transition from the s - branch to the u - branch .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the properties of oscillatons by numerically evolving the einstein - klein - gordon equations . according to the results",
    ", oscillatons can be classified into two well definite groups , the s and u - branches .",
    "s - branch oscillatons are stable equilibrium configurations , which oscillate according to their fundamental and intrinsic frequency ( @xmath40 ) . when slightly perturbed , these oscillatons vibrate with definite frequencies which we have identified as the frequencies ( @xmath92 ) of their particular quasi - normal modes .",
    "this is supported by the fact that these vibrations are small - amplitude oscillations around the equilibrium configurations .",
    "if these oscillatons are strongly perturbed such that their original mass is decreased , they migrate to and settle down onto other s - branch oscillatons .",
    "this fact points out that s - oscillatons should be seen as final states to which other scalar configurations migrate to .    on the other hand",
    ", we have found that s - oscillatons do not , in general , collapse into black holes if their mass is increased by the perturbation . even though we have found that oscillatons with high - central densities form black holes if their mass is larger than the critical value @xmath129 , diluted oscillatons can avoid such fate by means of the gravitational cooling mechanism .",
    "the later can be so efficient that strongly perturbed oscillatons can migrate to stable configurations , even if their initial mass was much larger than the critical value .",
    "the evolutions of the u - branch oscillatons consistently show that they are intrinsically unstable configurations . even under small perturbations",
    ", they migrate to the s - branch .",
    "this migration also appears when they are strongly perturbed in such a way that their original mass is decreased .",
    "however , another manifestation of their unstable nature is that they rapidly collapse into black holes if their mass is increased , even by small amounts and even if the initial mass is well below the critical value .    in all cases of migrating oscillatons",
    ", we found that their evolution can be followed by measuring their vibration frequency , and this can be used to predict to which configuration the perturbed oscillatons will migrate to .    through this paper",
    ", we have studied oscillatons with a quadratic scalar potential for simplicity .",
    "however , we have already initiated similar studies to include a self - interaction in the potential and they are work in progress to appear elsewhere .",
