    "there has been accumulating evidence that a class of supernovae ( sne ) is related to long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; see piran 1999 for a review ) and possibly to their low energy analog , x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; heise et al .",
    "2001 ) . the discovery of sn 1998bw in the error box of grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) raised the issue , and now the association between grbs and sne is firmly confirmed by the emergence of supernova spectra in the optical afterglows of some grbs , i.e. , sn 2003dh / grb 030329 ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ; kawabata et al . 2003 ; matheson et al .",
    "2003 ; stanek et al .",
    "2003 ) , sn 2003lw / grb 031203 ( malesani et al . 2004 ; thomsen et al .",
    "2004 , mazzali et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and sn 2002lt / grb 021211 ( della valle et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all these supernovae ( except sn 2002lt ) seem to belong to a special class ( see e.g. , matheson 2004 for a review ) .",
    "their spectra near maximum optical brightness are characterized by significant blending of very broad lines . a popular idea to explain this feature in the grb - related supernovae is a hyper - energetic explosion ( @xmath6 ergs @xmath7 ) of a very massive star ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "such an energetic supernova is often called a `` hypernova '' ( iwamoto et al . 1998 ; nomoto et al .",
    "2004 ) , with a somewhat different use of the original terminology suggested by paczynski ( 1998 ) to describe the entire grb / afterglow phenomenon .",
    "the nature of grbs and hypernovae , and their mutual relation , are still the subject of debate .",
    "asphericity seems to be the key to understand both grbs and hypernovae .",
    "it is widely accepted that grbs are produced by a relativistic jet viewed on or near its axis ( frail et al . 2001 ; bloom , frail , & kulkarni 2003 ) .",
    "their physical link to hypernovae then suggests that hypernovae also should show signatures of asphericity , according to popular progenitor scenarios : a black - hole plus an accretion disk ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; brown et al .",
    "2000 ) , or a highly magnetized neutron star ( nakamura 1998 ; wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the hypernova models for the grb - related supernovae have been developed on the basis of modeling early phase observations up to @xmath9 2 months after the explosion . for sn 1998bw , photometric and spectroscopic observations covering more than 1 year",
    "are available ( sollerman et al . 2000 ; patat et al . 2001 ) .",
    "since sn 1998bw was the first supernova being identified as the counterpart of a grb ( grb980425 ) , and it has been extensively referred to as a prototypical hypernova , it is important to understand its nature .",
    "studying the late phase light curve and spectra has provided additional hints on the nature of sn 1998bw . while the early phase observations can be reproduced by a `` spherical '' hypernova model ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ; nakamura et al .",
    "2001 ) , the light curve after @xmath10 months declined less steeply than the spherical hypernova model prediction ( mckenzie & schaefer 1999 ) . a similar problem exists for other hypernovae ( e.g. , mazzali , iwamoto , & nomoto 2000 ; yoshii et al .",
    "2003 ) and some sne iib / ib / ic ( e.g. , clocchiatti & wheeler 1997 ) . for hypernovae ,",
    "maeda et al . ( 2003a ) attributed the failure of the spherical models to the possible existence of an inner low - velocity dense core , which may be formed as the consequence of an aspherical explosion ( e.g. , maeda & nomoto 2003b ) .",
    "late phase spectra provide an excellent tool to examine the geometry of the ejecta , as they can probe deeper than the early - phase spectra .",
    "the nebular spectra of sn 1998bw showed peculiar features which were not explained by a simple picture ( patat et al .",
    "first , the [ oi ] 6300  & 6363doublet shows a sharply peaked emission profile .",
    "the profile is different from both the parabolic profile expected from a homogeneous spherical distribution of emitting material and the flat - topped boxy profile expected from material distributed in a shell .",
    "sollerman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that both the spherical hypernova model co138 of iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( co138e30 ; the explosion with @xmath11 of a @xmath12 co star evolved from a zero - age main sequence star of @xmath13 ) , and co6c of woosley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( @xmath14 , a 6.55 @xmath15 co star , and @xmath16 ) yielded too broad [ oi ] 6300  emission .",
    "the feature near 5200 , interpreted as a blend of [ feii ] in mazzali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also shows a peculiarity : it is broader than the [ oi ] 6300 .",
    "mazzali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that each line contributing to the [ feii ] blend should be broader than the [ oi ] 6300 , i.e. , velocities of once - ionized iron ions should be higher than those of neutral oxygen along the line of sight .",
    "subsequently , maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) computed the theoretical line profiles expected from bipolar aspherical models .",
    "they showed that the peculiarity of the [ oi ] 6300  and [ feii ] 5200  emissions in sn 1998bw can be explained by the aspherical explosion models , if the axis of symmetry is roughly aligned with the line of sight .",
    "although these previous studies revealed the peculiarities and suggested possible solutions , there were still some limitations .",
    "as for one dimensional models , previous studies ( sollerman et al .",
    "2000 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2001 ) did not model the full set of late - phase spectra at various epochs on the basis of a hydrodynamic model .",
    "concerning two dimensional models , the analysis of maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) had the following limitations .",
    "( 1 ) first , they applied a simplified time - independent computation for the line profiles .",
    "( 2 ) they did not model the flux . a more detailed analysis based on nebular line emission physics",
    "is necessary to derive the nature , e.g. , the explosion energy , of the explosion .",
    "( 3 ) also , it should be examined if their models , focusing on the [ feii ] 5200  and the [ oi ] 6300 , are consistent with other emission lines , e.g. , mgi ] 4570  and [ caii ] 7300 .",
    "( 4 ) their model grid ( in energy and mass ) was rather coarse . to constrain physical values such as the energy , models with various energies and masses should be examined comprehensively .",
    "( 5 ) finally , they only examined one nebular spectrum ( + 216 days after the maximum optical luminosity ) .",
    "it is important to examine if `` one '' model can consistently reproduce the temporal evolution of spectra .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a more detailed analysis of the nebular spectra of sn 1998bw than previous works .",
    "in addition to one dimensional spectrum synthesis , we use a two dimensional nebular spectrum synthesis code , which includes two - dimensional @xmath17-ray transfer and a computation of ionization / thermal structures for two - dimensional density and abundance distributions .",
    "first , the nebular spectra of sn 1998bw are examined by means of one dimensional spectrum synthesis in  2 , to obtain conditions necessary to explain the spectra of sn 1998bw .",
    "the subsequent parts are devoted to the two dimensional models . in ",
    "3 we describe models and method , and present a comparison between the synthetic spectra and the observations . summary and discussion are presented in  4 .",
    "we use a non - lte code to compute nebular spectra .",
    "the code is an extension of the one - zone nebular code of mazzali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , allowing radially stratified density and abundance distributions as an input model .",
    "first , a monte - carlo method ( e.g. , cappellaro et al . 1997 ; chugai 2000 ; maeda et al .",
    "2003a ) is used to solve the transport of @xmath17-rays released by the decay chain @xmath18ni @xmath19 @xmath18co@xmath19 @xmath18fe .",
    "positrons released by the same decay chain are assumed to be trapped _ in situ _ ( axelrod 1980 ) .",
    "the light curve of sn 1998bw suggests that at a few hundred days @xmath17-rays are still the dominant heating source ( nakamura et al .",
    "2001 ; maeda et al .",
    "2003a ) , making the heating of the ejecta little sensitive to the detail of positron transport ( e.g. , milne , the , & leising 2001 ) .    next ,",
    "ionization and nlte thermal balance in each shell are solved on the basis of the prescription given by ruiz - lapuente & lucy ( 1992 ) .",
    "for the ionization source , we consider only impact ionizations by high - energy particles produced by the deposition of @xmath17-rays ( and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the ionization balance is then solved by equating the impact ionization rate to the recombination rate for each ion .",
    "an assumption here is that photoionization is negligible .",
    "although it is still a matter of debate ( see e.g. , sollerman et al .",
    "2004 ) , it is argued that large multiple resonance scattering at high energies effectively reduces the uv radiation , therefore reduces the photoionizations ( kozma & fransson 1998b ; kozma et al .",
    "level populations are obtained by solving rate equations in steady state for each level along with the thermal balance ( i.e. , equating of the non - thermal heating rate and the line cooling rate ) .",
    "we consider mainly forbidden lines as a source of cooling ( ruiz - lapuente & lucy 1992 ) , but strong allowed transitions , e.g. , caii ir , are also included . under nebular conditions , radiative losses are entirely due to collisionally excited lines .",
    "we do not take radiation transfer effects into account , since the epochs examined in the present work are later than @xmath21 days so that radiation transfer effects are usually small at least at optical wavelengths ( see  4.5.1 for more detail ) .",
    "observationally , after day @xmath22 , neither the feature at 4570   nor that at 6300  evolved significantly ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ) , indicating that these features are totally dominated by forbidden lines and that radiation transfer effects are negligible .",
    "in particular , we do not include line scattering and fluorescence , an assumption that is usually made in nebular analysis ( e.g. , kozma et al .",
    "fluorescence may have effects in some lines , i.e. , ca ii h , k and ir - triplet , and nai ( kozma & fransson 1998b ) , for which we do not present detailed modeling in the present work .",
    "finally , a synthetic spectrum is obtained by integrating the emission from each shell .    throughout the paper , synthetic spectra",
    "are compared with the spectra of sn 1998bw taken at 125 , 200 , 337 , and 376 days after b maximum ( patat et al . 2001 ) . the first spectrum ( @xmath23 ) may not fully be nebular and hence can not be fully interpreted using the present computational code ( see  4 ) . despite this , we include this spectrum in the comparison .",
    "the spectrum is at least partly nebular and therefore can still be used to reject any model producing a spectrum very different from it .      with the time - dependent computational code , we first examine the synthetic spectra for the original spherical hypernova model co138e30 ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; nakamura et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the mass cut , i.e. , the boundary between the collapsing core and the ejecta , chosen in the present work is deeper than the original , yielding the mass of @xmath18ni @xmath24 in order to roughly fit luminosities at the late phases ( the original model with @xmath18ni @xmath25 is fainter than the late - phase observations ; nakamura et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the temporal evolution of the synthetic spectra as compared with the observed ones .",
    "we next try to obtain better fits by changing the density structure below @xmath26 km s@xmath1 and the abundance distribution throughout the ejecta ( described below in more detail ) .",
    "the temporal sequence of the spectra of this `` modified '' co138e30 model is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the density structure and abundance distribution are shown in figures 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the `` original '' model has difficulties in reproducing both ( a ) line profiles in each single spectrum and ( b ) temporal evolution . as for the line profiles ( a )",
    ", elements in outer layers such as o and mg produce synthetic lines with very wide , flat - topped profiles , while the observed [ oi ] 6300  and mgi ] 4570  are narrow and sharply peaked .",
    "the flat - topped profile is the consequence of the distribution of emitting material with a central hole ( see figures 3 and 4a : o is distributed at @xmath27 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "contrary to the observations , the synthetic [ feii ] 5200  blend is narrower than the synthetic [ oi ] 6300 .",
    "this is a typical character of any spherically symmetric evolution - collapse - explosion model , as was pointed out by mazzali et al .",
    "the problem in the temporal evolution ( b ) is that the `` original '' co138e30 model yields very rapidly fading lines [ oi ] 6300   and mgi ] 4570  between the epochs @xmath23 and @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    the modified model ( fig .",
    "2 ) is constructed so as to overcome these problems .",
    "the line profiles suggest that fe ( mainly synthesized as @xmath18ni at the explosion ) is on average distributed at higher velocities than hydrostatic burning products , e.g. , o and mg .",
    "the sharply peaked [ oi ] and mgi ] lines can be accounted for if these lines are predominantly emitted at low velocity . in the one dimensional representation ,",
    "a peculiar abundance distribution is therefore required : a high density o - rich core is added to the original co138e30 model .",
    "it also helps to explain the more rapid decline of the [ feii ] than the [ oi ] 6300  and the mgi ] 4570   emission ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ) , since the contribution of higher velocity material becomes smaller as time goes by .",
    "because deposition rate is larger in the modified model than in the original one , the mass of @xmath18ni is smaller in the former , @xmath29(@xmath18ni ) @xmath30 .",
    "another feature of the modified model is some mixing between the fe - rich layer ( originally at velocities at @xmath31 km s@xmath1 ) and the o - rich core ( added at @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the observed [ feii ] 5200  and [ caii ] 7300  lines show mildly peaked profiles ( though less sharply peaked than the [ oi ] and mgi ] ) , suggesting that a small fraction of the fe - rich materials are mixed downward into the low velocity o - rich core .",
    "the suggestion that ( at least in a spherically symmetric representation ) mixing is necessary was already made by sollerman et al .",
    "our model represents an even more unusual structure ( from the point of view of 1d hydrodynamics ) , since the o - rich core is located at low velocities together with just a small fraction of fe .",
    "this helps to keep the ionization of fe as high as what is inferred from the observed spectra , although the usual mixing ( sollerman et al .",
    "2000 ) with an fe - dominated central region will lead to too low an ionization .",
    "the mixing is also favored in view of the temporal evolution of each line intensity . without any mixing , energy deposited by @xmath17-rays and positrons into the o - rich region",
    "is all reprocessed into oxygen lines , predominantly into the [ oi ] 6300 , 6363  doublet . therefore , the temporal evolution of [ oi ] 6300  emission roughly traces the deposition rate , yielding too rapid fading of the line from @xmath23 to @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "if other elements such as iron are mixed in , then the situation is different .",
    "intensity of each line depends on contribution from others , which also depends on thermal condition within the nebula . in the materials composed with both iron and oxygen , the intensity ratio [ feii ] 5200/[oi ] 6300  decreases rapidly with decreasing density , yielding larger relative intensity of [ oi ] 6300  in more advanced epochs .",
    "given that the sum of the intensities of these lines roughly follows the deposition rate , increasing relative importance of [ oi ] 6300  with time yields the [ oi ] less rapidly fading than in the absence of any mixing .",
    "the modified model ( figs . 3 and 4b ) is constructed by mixing fe from the fe - rich layer downward into the o - rich core and compensate for it by mixing oxygen from the o - rich core into the fe - rich layer .",
    "the same is also done for ca . in addition ,",
    "intensity of the [ oi ] 6300  at the first epoch is further decreased by introducing clumping in the o - rich region .",
    "regarding clumping , first introduced for sn 1998bw by mazzali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the following facts give hints : ( 1 ) without clumping [ feiii ] is too strong at @xmath32 , which is not seen in the observations .",
    "( 2 ) the intensity ratio of [ caii ] 7300  to caii ir is too large in the original co138e30 model .",
    "therefore , we have introduced a filling factor of 0.1 throughout the ejecta the filling factor is kept unchanged at all epochs .",
    "comparing figures 1 and 2 , it is seen that the fit to the observed spectral sequence is very much improved .",
    "there are still some difficulty in reproducing the spectrum at @xmath23 ( while it is much better than the original model ) .",
    "in addition to the strong [ oi ] 6300  emission in the synthetic spectrum , mgi ] 4570  was also too strong at the first epoch ( in fig .",
    "2 , the mass fraction of mg is reduced by a factor of 10 at the first epoch relative to the subsequent epochs ) . however , it may simply be that the density in the first epoch is too high to apply the nebular spectral computation ( see  4 ) .",
    "the present model is in a sense _ ad hoc _ , introducing peculiar elements distribution and density structure ( i.e. , o - rich core ) .",
    "we will show in  3 that this apparent peculiarity in one - dimensional representation can naturally be interpreted in the context of a two - dimensional model .",
    "we have developed a two - dimensional code , which is applicable to any two - dimensional distribution of density and abundances ( including the distribution of the heating source @xmath18ni ) . in the current version , axisymmetry along the @xmath33-axis ( polar axis ) and reflection symmetry on the equatorial plane are assumed .",
    "the included physics is the same with the one dimensional code .",
    "the difference between the one- and two - dimensional versions is in the treatment of the @xmath17-ray deposition and the computation of the whole spectrum . the @xmath17-ray deposition is solved as a two dimensional radiation transport problem using the monte - carlo method .",
    "ionization and nlte thermal balance are solved in each mesh zone independently , since these processes take place locally as long as the optical depth is negligibly small .",
    "a synthetic spectrum is then computed for different orientations ( divided uniformly into 10 degree angular zones ) , taking into account different doppler shifts for different orientations .",
    "we use as input the models presented in maeda et al .",
    "these include spherical and aspherical explosions of a @xmath34 he star , the core of a star of @xmath35 .",
    "asphericity was generated assuming angle - dependent energy deposition , preferentially concentrated toward the polar direction , at the center of the collapsing core ( see maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for details ) .",
    "the models we explore in this paper are listed in table 1 .",
    "the distributions of density and of a few selected elements in the homologous expansion phase are presented in figure 5 .",
    "we examine models with various degree of asphericity defined by the parameter bp .",
    "the value of bp is the axial ratio of the initial aspherical energy injection .",
    "see maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for details ( their parameter @xmath36 is the same as bp ) .",
    "the models correspond to those of maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as follows : bp16 ( a ) , bp8 ( c ) , bp2 ( e ) , and a spherical model bp1 ( f ) . in the present work , we add an additional model ( bp4 ) which has an asphericity intermediate between models bp8 and bp2 , by repeating the calculations of maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) but with a different asphericity parameter .",
    "as seen in table 1 , we generate a series of models with various kinetic energy by artificially multiplying the velocities at any points in the ejecta by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "the factor @xmath37 is taken as a parameter , ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 .",
    "for each model specified by the parameters bp and @xmath37 , the masses of oxygen ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath18ni in the ejecta are changed by hand in order to obtain a good fit to the intensities of the [ oi ] 6300 , 6363and the [ feii ] 5200  ( see  3.2 for details ) . the kinetic energy in the ejecta is scaled as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the ejecta mass , mainly oxygen , obtained by spectral fitting . because of the procedure , the oxygen mass and therefore the kinetic energy are different from the original values ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "computing nebular spectra for these models , we obtain synthetic spectra resulting from various energies and ejecta masses ( and thus progenitor masses ) . summarizing ,",
    "a spectrum of a particular model is specified by three parameters : the asphericity bp , the velocity scale @xmath37 ( which gives the energy in the ejecta ) , and the orientation to the observer @xmath43 ( defined as the angle between the polar and the observer direction ) .",
    "we compare our synthetic spectra for the two dimensional , aspherical supernovae with the spectra of sn 1998bw ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ) obtained at 125 , 200 , 337 , and 376 days after b maximum .",
    "we especially focus on the + 337@xmath44 spectrum , since the epoch is sufficiently late that the contribution of allowed fe transitions ( which are not included in the model ) on the [ feii ] blend near 5200  is likely negligible ( see  4.5.1 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows examples of the synthetic spectra with a viewing angle @xmath45 .",
    "the synthetic spectra are very much improved for the aspherical model , especially for the one with bp=8 and @xmath37 = 1.15 , compared to the spherical hydrodynamic explosion models ( either the original co138e30 in fig . 1 or models bp1 in fig . 6 ) .",
    "the sharply peaked mgi ] 4570 , [ oi ] 6300 , 6363 , and nai 5900 , as well as the broad [ feii ] , are naturally explained .",
    "indeed , the fit by the aspherical model bp8 ( @xmath37=1.15 ) is as good as the one by the one dimensional `` modified '' co138e30 model .",
    "the masses of oxygen and @xmath18ni are determined so as to obtain the correct line strengths ( at + 337days ) in the two - dimensional models .",
    "this is done by reducing / increasing the density uniformly throughout either the @xmath18ni or o rich region ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , each line profile is not sensitively affected by this procedure but results from the explosion model itself .",
    "figure 6 also shows how different kinetic energy and asphericity affect the synthetic spectrum .",
    "for example , we can definitely rule out the model bp2 with @xmath37=1.6 for sn 1998bw , since the [ oi ] 6300  line is too broad and its shape is less sharply peaked than in the observation .",
    "we discuss the profiles of each line in more detail in  3.3 and in the appendix .",
    "the selection of models acceptable for sn 1998bw is discussed in  3.4 .",
    "because the intensities of the [ feii ] 5200  and the [ oi ] 6300  are well defined in the observation , they can be used to constrain the masses of iron ( mostly the product of @xmath18ni decay ) and oxygen .",
    "these are model - dependent as the combination of mass and energy gives the average density , which in turn gives the deposition rate .",
    "for example , we find that the original hydrodynamic models ( where @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) yield too strong [ oi ] emission relative to [ feii ] 5200 . therefore @xmath38 should be reduced to fit the line ratio correctly ( e.g. , @xmath46 in model bp1 , @xmath37=1 ) . in the current study ,",
    "we have uniformly reduced densities in oxygen - dominated regions , and therefore @xmath38 , until we obtained the correct intensity ratio [ oi ] 6300/[feii ] 5200  at day + 337 . the mass of @xmath18ni is also constrained by the total luminosity in the observed spectrum .",
    "therefore , we also changed the mass of @xmath18ni ( densities in @xmath18ni dominated regions ) until we obtained the correct luminosity at @xmath47 .",
    "the masses @xmath29(@xmath18ni ) and @xmath38 consistent with the observed flux at @xmath47 are thus derived for all the models as listed in table 1 .",
    "note that a model with larger @xmath37 has lower density and smaller deposition rate , and therefore needs larger @xmath38 and @xmath29(@xmath18ni ) to fit the observed intensities .",
    "this is the reason the energy @xmath48 in the larger @xmath37 models is larger than expected from the simple scaling @xmath49 , because the mass of the ejecta needed is also larger for larger @xmath37 .",
    "dependencies of line profiles of the [ feii ] blend 5200 , the [ oi ] 6300 , 6363   doublet , the mgi ] 4570 , and the [ caii ] 7291 , 7324  on the three parameters , @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and bp are described in appendix in detail . here",
    "we give a very brief summary .",
    "* * @xmath37 : * irrespective of @xmath50 and @xmath43 , larger @xmath37 yields broader profiles for every line . * * @xmath43 : * the profile depends on whether the emitting element is explosive burning product ( fe and ca ) or hydrostatic product ( o and mg ) . for the former ,",
    "the line is broader for smaller @xmath43 . for the latter ,",
    "the dependence is in the opposite sense .",
    "* * bp : * for explosive burning products , larger bp yields a broader [ narrower ] line if @xmath43 is small [ large ] . for hydrostatic products ,",
    "the dependence is in the opposite sense .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss which models are acceptable for sn 1998bw , according to each line profile (  3.3 and appendix ) . on the basis of the selected models , we further seek for conditions that may yield better fits to the observations in a manner similar to what was done for the 1d model ( by introducing mixing and clumping ;  2.2 ) .",
    "figure 7 illustrates how the model parameters are constrained by the observations .",
    "a fit is judged by the following rules . for the [ feii ] 5200",
    ", it is checked if the width of the blend is consistent with the observed value .",
    "the region of acceptance is larger for @xmath51 than @xmath52 , since the former results in a broader profile . for the [ oi ] 6300 ,",
    "if a model fits well the line wings and does not produce a double - peaked emission line , it is regarded to be acceptable .",
    "the fit to the mgi ] 4570  is not included , because the mgi ] gives the same constraints as the [ oi ] 6300  lines , but with less accuracy .",
    "the fit to the [ caii ] 7300  line is uncertain . in a strict sense ,",
    "no present model , either spherical or aspherical , gives acceptable fits , since the observed line center is shifted blueward relative to the models .",

    "there are several ways to shift the line center or to depress the emission in the red , as we will discuss in  4 .",
    "the region of acceptance for [ caii ] 7300  moves to more aspherical and more energetic models ( yielding a broader ca line ) for larger viewing angle @xmath43 ( yielding a narrower ca line ) , so that these two effects compensate one another .",

    "viewing angles @xmath56 do not produce an acceptable fit to [ oi ] 6300 .",
    "also , the width of the [ oi ] line sets an upper limit for @xmath37 ( and therefore on the energy ) , since models with @xmath57 produce too broad [ oi ] emission .",

    "( 2002 ) ( who did not include the [ caii ] in the model ) . if only the [ feii ] , [ oi ] ( and mgi ] ) are considered in the fit , the fit by models with @xmath61 is as nice as @xmath62 .",
    "the [ caii ] 7300  feature is complicated and therefore needs further study to understand its nature (  4 ) .",

    "the fit to the wings of the [ oi ] emission , however , is not bad , therefore the fit is marginal .    for sn 1998bw ,",
    "this is the first attempt to check the consistency of a theoretical model by time - dependent computations .",
    "figure 8 shows that both models have difficulty in reproducing the slowly fading [ oi ] 6300  and mgi ] 4570  from @xmath23 to @xmath28 , a similar problem also encountered for the one dimensional model co138e30 .",
    "as done in  2 , we have attempted to obtain better fits , by introducing mixing and clumping .",

    "obviously hydrodynamic explosion models , either one or two dimensional , yield a mass fraction of carbon in the o - rich region insufficiently small to fit the [ ci ] line strength ( see also fig .",
    "finally , we have introduced filling factors to simulate clumping both for the fe - rich and the o - rich regions .    these parameters for mixing and clumping",

    "the modified 2d models match the observed spectra as nicely as the modified 1d model ( see fig .",

    "( 2 ) a high - density o - rich core below @xmath65 km s@xmath1 is necessary to explain the sharply - peaked [ oi ] 6300 , 6363  doublet profile .",
    "( 3 ) at the same time , a large amount of @xmath18ni ( which decays into fe ) should be located at @xmath66 km s@xmath1 to reproduce the large ratio between the widths of [ feii ] 5200  and [ oi ] 6300 .",
    "the above three features are not accounted for by any spherically symmetric evolution - collapse - explosion calculations .",
    "( 4 ) heavy elements such as fe and ca are likely mixed into the o - rich region , and vice versa .",
    "namely , o , fe , and ca do not occupy completely separated layers . ( 5 ) clumping is important both in o - rich and fe - rich regions .    in the context of the two - dimensional models , our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the [ feii ] 5200  and the [ oi ] 6300  lines are naturally reproduced by ( some ) aspherical models , confirming the suggestion of maeda et al .",
    "( 2 ) the profile of the mgi ] 4571  gives additional support to the aspherical model for sn 1998bw .",
    "the analysis of the [ caii ] profile demonstrates , however , that the present models are still not perfect .",
    "( 3 ) examining a wide parameter range , we have shown that nebular spectra of sn  1998bw indeed require a hyper - energetic explosion ( see also  4.2 ) . ( 4 ) similar to the 1d model , mixing and clumping are at least partly responsible for the slow spectrum evolution from @xmath23 to @xmath28 .",
    "according to the present model , we can infer the nature of sn 1998bw .",
    "it was an highly aspherical explosion ( bp @xmath67 ) viewed at @xmath68 .",
    "the viewing angle is consistent with the off - axis model ( @xmath69 ) explaing properties of prompt gamma ray emission of grb 980425 associated with sn 1998bw ( yamazali , yonetoku , & nakamura 2003 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy in the explosion models giving the best fits was @xmath70 , mass of @xmath18ni @xmath29(@xmath18ni ) @xmath71 ) , and mass of oxygen in the ejecta @xmath72 .",
    "the mass of oxygen would correspond to a co core of @xmath73 and to a he core of @xmath74 , which is evolved from a star with @xmath75 .",
    "the argument assumes the central remnant is a @xmath76 black hole , which could be larger if a larger fraction of the o - dominated layer is accreted onto the black hole ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; maeda & nomoto 2003b ) .",
    "here we would like to discuss the uniqueness of the model .",
    "a fit to each line is used to restrict a possible range in the parameter space ( bp , @xmath77 , and @xmath43 ) .",
    "because the line shapes of different elements depend on the parameters differently ( see  3.3 and  3.4 ) , the combination of fits to several lines is useful to narrow down the parameter space ( fig .",
    "once these parameters are given , then the masses of @xmath18ni and ejecta mass are derived based on the line intensities , and therefore @xmath29(@xmath18ni ) , @xmath78 , and @xmath48 are determined rather uniquely .",
    "the above model is derived including a qualitative fit to [ caii ] 7300 , which is not very certain in the present study ( see  3.4 and  4.5.2 ) .",
    "if we omit this line , and use only the [ oi ] 6300 , mgi ] 4570 , and [ feii ] 5200 , then the degeneracy is not completely resolved ( fig .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath45 the models with bp @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) are acceptable . for smaller @xmath43 ,",
    "the range is even larger , while values @xmath82 are disfavored because they do not even give a qualitatively acceptable fit to [ caii ] 7300 .",
    "the models can be further constrained by fitting early - phase observations , i.e. , light curve and spectra ( k. maeda , in preparation ) .",
    "we regard the above mass of oxygen and especially the kinetic energy in the two - dimensional model as lower limits of those in the real ejecta for the following reason . although we have computed a spectrum based on realistic explosion models , it is not certain that the models really give a good representation of material at velocities @xmath83 km s@xmath1 since they emit little at the late - phases .",
    "our explosion models contain material up to @xmath84 km s@xmath1 for @xmath85 , above which the density drops very rapidly as a function of radius and therefore was not traced by the two - dimensional explosion calculations .",
    "however , the early - phase spectra suggest there is material up to @xmath86 km s@xmath1 which carries a substantial fraction of the total kinetic energy ( nakamura et al .",
    "2001 ; see also mazzali et al .",
    "although the origin of such material is not clear , its existence suggests that the total kinetic energy should be larger than that of the present two - dimensional model .    in any case",
    ", the lower limit of the kinetic energy @xmath87 is much larger than the typical value @xmath88 .",
    "less energetic models do not fit the observed nebular spectra of sn 1998bw , especially at [ feii ] 5200 .    also , our models suggest that the ejecta is likely very clumpy and that nucleosynthetically different layers are mixed .",
    "this is necessary to explain the spectral evolution , especially the slow fading of [ oi ] 6300  and mgi ] 4570   between @xmath23 and @xmath28 .",
    "the amount of mixing is small and may well be explained in the context of rayliegh - taylor or shear instabilities between the o - rich and the fe - rich region ( for fe and ca ) and between the o - rich region and the c layer above it ( for c ) .",
    "such mixing processes are believed to take place in core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , the earlier than expected detection of x - rays and @xmath17-rays from sn 1987a : dotani et al .",
    "1987 ; sunyaev et al . 1987 ; matz et al .",
    "1988 : see e.g. , kifonidis et al .",
    "2000 for recent simulations ) .",
    "also , aspherical explosions are suggested to boost the efficiency of the mixing ( nagataki , shimizu , & sato 1998 ) .",
    "while we have introduced a rather large c abundance ( 10% ) in the o - rich region , both c and o are hydrostatic burning products , and therefore additional mixing could also operate in hydrostatic evolution stages .",
    "this may be naturally explained by rotationally induced mixing ( e.g. , iwamoto et al . 2005 ) , since the large asphericity at the explosion implies that the progenitor star was a very rapid rotator .",
    "we derived a mass of @xmath18ni , @xmath29(@xmath18ni ) @xmath89 in the two dimensional model .",
    "this is consistent with the results of previous work ( e.g. , nakamura et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath18ni in our model is characterized by a large amount of @xmath18ni in the high velocity outer region , and a small fraction in the inner high density region .",
    "the distribution will affect the shape of the light curve .",
    "figure 10 shows the evolution of the luminosity deposited by @xmath17-rays and positrons , i.e. , optical light curve applicable after @xmath90 days .",
    "at least qualitatively , the 2d models are favored over the original 1d co138e30 model , thanks to the presence of @xmath18ni at high velocities and the high density core at low velocities ( maeda et al .",
    "computation of 2d light curves from the explosion to the late - phases on the basis of the two dimensional models will be another check of the validity of the models ( see also hflich , wheeler , & wang 1999 ) .",
    "our suggestion that hypernovae are aspherical explosions may further be able to be confirmed by future observations .",
    "first , we suggest to take late - phase near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of supernovae with sn 1998bw - like early - phase spectra , as has been done for sne ia ( e.g. , hflich et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the nir ,",
    "a [ feii ] line is more isolated than in the optical band , making the effect of the orientation easier to see .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the [ oi ] 6300  profile in other hypernovae and sne ib / c to investigate the effect of the viewing angle .",
    "recently , kawabata et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported the detection of the double - peaked [ oi ] 6300  in a spectrum of sn 2003jd at @xmath91 year after the discovery .",
    "mazzali et al .",
    "( 2005 ) interpreted it as a sn 1998bw - like event , as suggested from early - phase spectroscopy , but viewed from the equatorial direction .",
    "although the sample is small in number for hypernovae , late - phase spectra such as those published for sne ib / c by matheson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) would allow statistical studies to constrain the explosion energy and the asphericity of sne ib / c .",
    "one of the major advances in the present study is the time - dependent computations of the nebular spectra of sn 1998bw .",
    "the model derived at the spectrum at + 337@xmath64 gives nice fits to the sequence of the spectra after + 200@xmath64 .",
    "however , at the first epoch + 125@xmath64 , some deviation from the observations still exists especially in the luminosity of the [ oi ] 6300 , 6363  doublet , even though we have tried to fix this by introducing mixing and clumping .",
    "others are the strong [ feii ] and [ feiii ] between 4000  and 5000 and the strong mgi ] 4570  and [ oi ] 5577  in the model",
    ". they may simply be due to inappropriate treatment of the first epoch + 125@xmath64 in our computation since at this epoch the ejecta density is still high and the nebular representation may not totally be a good approximation .",
    "temporal evolution of the intensity of the [ oi ] 6300  changed around @xmath23 ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ) , implying that at this epoch the ejecta are still in the transition from the photospheric phase to the nebular phase .",
    "for example , the observationally strong oi 7800  implies that allowed transitions may be dominant in some wavelength ranges .",
    "because of the possible presence of emission lines of some strong allowed fe ii transitions , the identification of the 5200  feature as the blend of forbidden lines only may be uncertain . axelrod ( 1980 ) computed optical depths of the strongest allowed fe ii lines near 5200  for a model",
    "sn ia nebula at days 87 and 264 to be of the order of 10 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "given the larger ratio @xmath92(@xmath18ni ) in our models for sn 1998bw than for sne ia , the optical depths will be even smaller .",
    "rough estimates suggest that a few lines may have optical depth of order unity at the first epoch ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore , at this epoch the contribution of the allowed fe ii lines and related radiation transfer effects , e.g. , line scattering , may affect ( but probably not dominate ) the shape of the 5200  feature . at the same time , the same estimate shows that the optical depths of the allowed fe lines will be very small ( of the order of 0.1 or less ) at @xmath28 and thereafter , justifying the assumption that the contribution of the allowed lines and radiation transfer effects are negligible .",
    "see also maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a detailed discussion of the identification of the 5200  feature as the forbidden lines .    as for the mgi ] 4570 , the line emissivity is quite sensitive to the treatment of the photoionization radiation field because of its low ionization threshold ( houck & fransson 1996 ; kozma & fransson 1998a ) , while the ionization by uv photons is not included in our present spectrum synthesis calculations ( see also , e.g. , sollerman et al .",
    "2004 for the effect of photoionization ) .",
    "this could partly be a reason of our failure in fitting the temporal evolution of the mgi ] 4570luminosity , since the effect is expected to be stronger at earlier epochs .",
    "we plan to extend our code to allow better treatment at such relatively early epochs .",
    "the final question we should answer in the future concerns the origin of the peculiar [ caii ] 7300  emission . as mentioned in appendix , the model spectra are too red .",
    "it is interesting that another hypernova , sn 2002ap , shows the [ caii ] 7300  line exactly at the correct position ( kawabata et al .",
    "2002 ; leonard et al . 2002 ; wang et al . 2003 ; foley et al .",
    "the blueshift of the line in sn 1998bw seems to be unique .",
    "the feature is a complex blend and therefore it is difficult to clarify the reason of the failure in the model . with this caveat taken in mind ,",
    "we speculate possibilities which may explain the discrepancy .",
    "the problem is possibly related to the distribution of ca .",
    "there are at least two possibilities to reconcile the problem .",
    "first , the distribution of ca may be similar to o , rather than fe .",
    "it will then be challenging to the theory of explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "another possible interpretation would be that sn1998bw may have asymmetry even between the two hemispheres .",
    "if we look at the event from the hemisphere with the larger kinetic energy , the center of the ca distribution would be blue shifted .",
    "this should however also apply to [ feii ] 5200 , which does not seem to show the shift",
    ". the significantly blended nature of [ feii ] 5200  may wash that signal away . in this context",
    ", sn2002ap would be an explosion in which the degree of this asymmetry is small or the viewing orientation is relatively large .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , and we will pursue this issue in the future .",
    "the above two possibilities could be resolved by examining a number of hypernova late - phase spectra . in our interpretation ,",

    "figures 11 , 12 , and 13 show how the shape of the [ feii ] blend at 5200  depends on the degree of asphericity and the observer direction .",
    "the dependence on the kinetic energy can also be seen by comparing figures 11 ( @xmath37=1.6 ) , 12 ( @xmath37=1.15 ) , and 13 ( @xmath37=0.7 ) .",
    "the dependencies can be summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) for a given asphericity , a smaller viewing angle @xmath43 leads to a broader feature ( with the obvious exception of the spherically symmetric models ) .",
    "( 2 ) larger asphericity leads to a broader [ narrower ] feature for small [ large ] @xmath43 .",
    "( 3 ) larger kinetic energy leads to a broader feature irrespective of the degree of asphericity and orientation .",
    "the above dependencies can be understood from the distribution of @xmath18ni ( fe ) in figure 5 .",
    "the distribution is elongated in the polar direction in the aspherical models .",
    "larger asphericity leads to higher velocities in the polar direction and smaller ones in the equatorial direction .",
    "if the energy is larger , the velocity in all directions becomes larger .",
    "these characters of the @xmath18ni distribution explain the dependence of the [ feii ] feature on various parameters .",
    "the observed broad 5200  emission can be explained if the asphericity is large , the energy is large , and the viewing angle @xmath43 is small ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "for example , figure 11 shows that for these very energetic models ( @xmath37=1.6 ) , the synthetic [ feii ] 5200  is as broad as the observed one for bp @xmath94 given @xmath55 . for less energetic models ,",
    "the criterion is tighter : for @xmath37=1.15 , bp @xmath79 is necessary to produce the broad feature . for @xmath37=0.7 , the synthetic [ feii ] 5200  is never as broad as the observed one , even if the asphericity bp is very large .",
    "note also that if both the energy and the asphericity are extremely large ( e.g. , @xmath37=1.6 and bp=16 ) , the synthetic feature is too broad .",
    "the dependence of the [ oi ] 6300 , 6363  doublet profile on various parameters is shown in figures 14  16 .",
    "the observed sharply - peaked profile with extended wings again favors highly aspherical models ( bp16 or bp8 ) viewed from a direction close to the pole ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "in addition , the narrow [ oi ] 6300  sets constraint on the model in a different way from the way the [ feii ] 5200  line does . for the less energetic models ( @xmath37=0.7 ) , all the aspherical models ( bp = 2  16 ) give nicely peaked profiles if viewed near the pole . for @xmath37=1.15 , larger bp ( bp @xmath95 ) is required .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath37=1.6 , the synthetic [ oi ] 6300  is broader than the observations , even for small viewing angles .",
    "the sharply - peaked [ oi ] profile is produced by the edge - on view of a disk - like oxygen distribution .",
    "the model predicts a double - peaked profile if viewed near the equator as shown in figures 14  16 for large @xmath43 . a spherical explosion model like co138e30 produces a flat - topped profile because of the central hole in oxygen distribution ( at @xmath96 km s@xmath1 for the kinetic energy @xmath11 ; figs . 4a and 5 ) , which does not fit well the observations , irrespective of the total kinetic energy .",
    "this is especially evident in the larger kinetic energy model ( @xmath37 @xmath97 ) which produces very broad [ oi ] 6300  emission .",
    "the observed profile of mgi ] 4570  is sharply peaked , similar to [ oi ] 6300  ( patat et al .",

    "the contribution of this line is also shown in figures 17  19 .",
    "the shape of the line favors highly - aspherical models viewed at small @xmath43 , supporting the results derived from the [ oi ] 6300  profile .",
    "figures 20  22 show synthetic spectra of the present models around 7300   compared to the observed one at 337 days after the b maximum .",

    "the [ oii ] 7322  line is weak in the model , because most oxygen is neutral , as suggested by the strong [ oi ] 6300  line .",
    "as shown in the figures , the models are redder than the observations . as mentioned above , the feature is a complex blend making the reason of the failure difficult to identify",
    ". for possible origins of the blueshift , see  4 .",
    "the [ caii ] 7292  and 7324  in the models bp16 with small viewing angle ( @xmath82 ) show double peaked profiles because the distribution of ca , as a product of explosive nucleosynthesis , follows closely that of fe rather than that of o , which is a product o f hydrostatic burning and a fuel at the explosion ( fig .",
    "a higher degree of asphericity ( i.e. , larger bp ) leads to more aspherically distributed ca .",
    "therefore , the double - peaked profile of ca for small viewing angle ( @xmath82 ) can be interpreted as two - blobs of ca moving in opposite directions observed on the symmetry axis .",
    "we do not see such a profile in sn 1998bw , suggesting a slightly off - axis viewing angle .    because of the significant blend of the feature at 7300 , constraining the energy in the ejecta by fitting this feature is very uncertain .",
    "as long as only line width is concerned , less energetic models are preferred if @xmath43 is smaller ( e.g. , @xmath51 ) , and more energetic ones if @xmath43 is larger ( e.g. , @xmath45 ) , since narrowing [ broadening ] the line by smaller [ larger ] energy must be compensated by broadening [ narrowing ] the line by smaller [ larger ] @xmath43 .",
