    "direct imaging of stars still remains exceptional , and approximate geometric information on the coronae of stars must be obtained from indirect methods such as image reconstruction from rotational modulation or eclipse mapping .",
    "the latter is a powerful means to image the corona of a star when applied to algol - type systems which are semi - detached binaries composed of a massive early - type star orbiting an evolved late - type star .",
    "the latter fills its roche lobe , hence a gas stream flows from the l1 lagrange point ( @xcite ) . the coronal emission originates exclusively from the late - type companion ; therefore , the simultaneous x - ray and radio eclipses at phase 0.5 can constrain the location of the coronal emitting regions and provide powerful information on the co - spatiality of the emission regions , with important implications for the structure of the outer atmospheres .    in algol - type systems ,",
    "the formation of an accretion disk around the primary depends on the location of the binary in the @xmath1-@xmath2 diagram , where @xmath1 is the radius of the primary in units of the binary separation , and @xmath2 is the mass ratio of the secondary to the primary ( @xcite ) . in brief , short - period algols , such as our target ,",
    "tend to populate a region of the @xmath1-@xmath2 diagram where the gas stream directly impacts on the primary while eventually forming a transient accretion disk . although the presence of circumstellar material has been indirectly inferred from h@xmath3 difference profiles ( @xcite ) ,",
    "its detection is still elusive in the x - rays .",
    "however , cool material can absorb x - rays if located along the line of sight , thus producing an extra column density detectable in x - rays .",
    "we present results of a multiwavelength coordinated campaign on in x - rays with _ xmm - newton _   and in radio with the vla .",
    "rz cas is a nearby ( @xmath4  pc ) algol - type binary , consisting of an a3  v primary and a k3  iv secondary with similar radii ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; @xcite ) , orbiting with synchronous rotation ( @xmath8  d ; @xcite ) .",
    "their masses are , however , different , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the secondary fills its roche lobe , and a flow of material falls directly onto the primary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital inclination angle ( @xmath11 ) leads to almost complete eclipses .",
    "@xcite found that rz cas displays variable x - ray luminosity , with a spread of an order of magnitude ( @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "they also found that a two - temperature optically thin plasma model was required to fit their _ asca _ and _ rosat _ pspc data , along with abundances about 0.2 times the solar photospheric values .",
    "their _ rosat _ observations showed significant intensity variations , apparently unrelated to the eclipse , but probably originating from either rotational modulation , flare activity , or inhomogeneous distributions of coronal structures on the secondary .",
    "a core - halo structure was proposed from radio data by @xcite , whereas @xcite observed a radio modulation close to the primary eclipse seemingly correlating with x - rays .",
    "_ xmm - newton _   observed rz cas for 110  ks from august 22 ( 5h23m54s ut ) to august 23 , 2003 ( 13h41m23s ut ) , whereas the vla observed on august 22 , 2003 from 4h41m20s ut to 19h38m30s ut .",
    "the vla was in a - array configuration , and we observed alternatively in the c ( 6.1 cm ) and x ( 3.55 cm ) bands , with 0137 + 331 ( 3c 48 ) as flux calibrator and 0228 + 673 as phase calibrator .",
    "figure  [ fig : campaign ] shows a diagram of the coordinated observations .",
    "the x - ray data were reduced with the _ xmm - newton _   sas software ( version 6 ) using standard procedures .",
    "the radio data were reduced with aips ( december 31 , 2003 version ) using standard techniques . the phases before 9h ut and after 16h ut were significantly degraded due to strong cumuloform clouds .",
    "no reliable solutions could be found during these periods ( see shaded regions in fig .  [",
    "fig : vlaxmm ] ) .",
    "we used different techniques to obtain the radio light curves in both bands and to check their consistency .",
    "figure  [ fig : vlaxmm ] shows the x - ray pn light curve for events from 0.25 to 8  kev ( panel a ) and a light curve of a hardness ratio ( panel b ) defined here as the ratio between the count rates in the hard band ( @xmath14  kev ) and the soft band ( @xmath15  kev ) .",
    "the x - ray eclipse is almost absent , with a local x - ray minimum about an hour _ after _ the optical eclipse of the k3 subgiant .",
    "the light curve modulation suggests , instead , the presence of extended x - ray sources which are not significantly eclipsed and are rotationally modulated ( e.g. , in particular in the phase range @xmath16 ) .",
    "it could also reflect the evolution of active regions in rz cas .",
    "a flare was observed at @xmath17 , i.e. , at the time of the eclipse of the primary a3  v star .",
    "however , the synchronous rotation of the stars does not suggest that @xmath17 should be a special orbital phase for flares .",
    "we found also that rz cas significantly became significantly and steadily hotter in the second half of the observation , as shown in the hardness ratio light curve .",
    "no obvious flare can explain such hardening , therefore we hypothesize that hot , active regions rose in this time span , probably due to some reconfiguration of the magnetic topology in rz cas .    the radio light curves in x and c bands are also shown in figure  [ fig : vlaxmm ] in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "a similar flux level was observed in both frequencies .",
    "panel ( e ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : vlaxmm ] shows a light curve of the spectral index @xmath3 ( assuming a power law for the radio spectrum , i.e. , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the shaded time ranges in the radio light curves correspond to time spans when an accurate calibration could not be obtained .",
    "the index @xmath3 appears to be shallow ( @xmath19 ) between 4.9  ghz and 8.4  ghz .",
    "this is consistent with the core - halo model proposed by @xcite for rz cas .",
    "the radio light curves show a steady flux increase , an a possible shallow eclipse is observed about 1.5  hours _ before _ the optical secondary eclipse .",
    "the spectral index @xmath3 possibly flattens during the radio eclipse .",
    "the marked difference in i ) eclipse timing , and ii ) in flux modulation in the x - rays and radio strongly suggests that the emitting sources are not co - spatial , at least during this coordinated campaign .",
    "this does not support the findings of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the shallow eclipses preclude compact sources in both wavelength regimes .",
    "furthermore , the absence of eclipse at phase @xmath17 indicates that the primary a - type star does not emit significant x - rays . finally ,",
    "the lack of significant eclipses at both primary and secondary eclipses precludes intrabinary ( or accretion spot ) x - ray and radio emissions in rz cas .",
    "instead , the light curves imply rotational modulation of extended sources and active regions rise in the second half of the x - ray observation .",
    "-4 mm    figure  [ fig : rgs ] shows the average _ xmm - newton _   rgs spectrum of rz cas .",
    "strong emission lines of o  viii , ne  x , ne  ix , and several fe l - shell lines can be observed on top of an underlying continuum .",
    "the high ne  x / ne  ix and o  viii / o  vii ratios indicate a dominant hot plasma in rz cas s corona .",
    "the faint o  vii triplet suggests a high intercombination - to - forbidden line ratio , albeit with a large error bar .",
    "although such a ratio could be indicative of a high - density ( @xmath20  @xmath21 ) plasma , it is in fact artificial and due to the strong uv field from the early - type primary ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the poor signal - to - noise ratio in the triplet prevented us from obtaining a phase - dependent line ratio , which would have confirmed the influence of the uv field ( minimal close to @xmath22 , maximal close to @xmath17 ) .",
    "we performed a multi-@xmath23 fit of the rz cas data using both mos spectra in the @xmath24     range and both rgs spectra above @xmath25   .",
    "we also discarded several wavelength ranges of the rgs data to avoid bias from poorly known l - shell lines of low - z ions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a 4-@xmath23 model fits the data adequately ( @xmath26 for 1202 d.o.f . ) , with @xmath27  mk , @xmath28  mk , @xmath29  mk , @xmath30  mk , @xmath31 @xmath21 , @xmath32  @xmath21 , @xmath33 @xmath21 , @xmath34  @xmath21 .",
    "coronal abundances ( relative to the solar photospheric abundances ; @xcite ) are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . all quoted uncertainties are 90 % confidence ranges ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the high n / c abundance ratio is a strong signature of cno cycle processed material .",
    "this has been observed in algol ( @xcite ) and in the rapidly rotating giant star yy men ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also performed time - dependent spectroscopy using the epic mos spectra only .",
    "we observed no significant variation in abundances .",
    "however , consistently with the hardness ratio light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vlaxmm ] ) , we obtained slightly hotter plasma in the second half of the observation , in particular in the last high - flux time segment .",
    "we also observed no variation in the spectral slope at low energies , implying that photoelectric absorption ( e.g. , due to the accretion disk near @xmath17 ) remained constant and was consistent with interstellar absorption .",
