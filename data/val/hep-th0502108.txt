    "the behavior of spacetime near a big crunch singularity has been a topic of research for many decades .",
    "the classic studies of belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite and others @xcite have shown that the contraction to the crunch can proceed either smoothly or chaotically .",
    "chaos arises when the universe is unstable to small inhomogeneities and anisotropies in curvature or matter fields .",
    "these  dangerous \" perturbations grow and eventually dominate the dynamics , driving the universe to an anisotropic state , expanding along some axes and contracting along others . the axes and their rates of contraction jump to new values when new curvature or matter terms grow to dominate .",
    "the jumps generally repeat an infinite number of times before the big crunch itself . the chaotic , oscillatory evolution to the big crunch",
    "is often known as  mixmaster \" behavior or  bkl oscillations .",
    "\"    models that generalize four dimensional einstein gravity have been classified by whether they necessarily exhibit chaotic behavior near a big crunch .",
    "this classification is established assuming  generic \" initial conditions , in which there is a finite , but possibly small , energy density in all fields present in the model .",
    "additionally , one assumes that the classical einstein equations remain valid up to the big crunch itself . under these assumptions",
    ", it has been shown that vacuum einstein gravity in spacetime dimension less than eleven , as well as all uncompactified ten dimensional string theories and m  theory , will inevitably suffer chaos as the big crunch is approached @xcite . so too will einstein gravity containing only perfect fluids with equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ratio of the fluid s pressure to its energy density . on the other hand , there are cases where chaos is not inevitable . among these",
    "are einstein gravity with a free massless scalar field , leading to @xmath3 , and a universe containing a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the presence of chaos during gravitational collapse is a potential problem for cosmological models with a big crunch / big bang transition , such as the ekpyrotic / cyclic and pre big ",
    "bang scenarios @xcite . in these models",
    ", the universe undergoes collapse to a big crunch , followed by a transition to the conventional big bang and subsequent expansion .",
    "it is assumed that , during the collapsing phase , the universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic , with a scale invariant perturbation spectrum .",
    "bkl oscillations arising during the collapsing phase would destroy homogeneity and isotropy , producing a chaotic spacetime with structure down to arbitrarily small scales .",
    "in this situation , a big crunch / big bang transition is unlikely to be describable in a deterministic manner , and it is questionable whether a homogeneous and isotropic universe with the long range correlations required by observations could emerge @xcite .",
    "thus , avoiding chaos is an essential feature of cosmological models with a collapsing phase .",
    "we take the point of view that avoiding chaos all the way to the the big crunch is too restrictive a condition for viable cosmological models .",
    "one expects classical general relativity to break down at a small but finite time before the big crunch is reached , perhaps of order a planck time @xmath5 or string time @xmath6 .",
    "after this point , quantum effects become significant and we can no longer trust the classical physics that predicts a chaotic approach to the big crunch . provided the universe evolves smoothly and non  chaotically until @xmath5 , it is conceivable that quantum gravity effects allow the universe to pass smoothly through the big crunch and into a subsequent expanding phase .",
    "for example , recent work @xcite has revealed that the degrees of freedom present in string and m  theory ( extendend objects such as strings and branes ) can evolve smoothly through certain types of big crunch singularities .",
    "this suggests that chaotic behavior is absent in the quantum gravity regime , and furthermore a nonsingular transition from a big crunch to a big bang is possible .",
    "our focus in the present work is on the classical evolution of the universe before @xmath5 , and whether it is possible for it to evolve smoothly so long as we can trust the classical equations of motion .",
    "the evolution of the universe through the subsequent quantum regime , and the transition to an expanding phase , are important though unsettled issues . in this work",
    "we have nothing to add on these topics .",
    "however , if chaos can be controlled during the classical evolution of the universe , there remains the hope that the subsequent quantum evolution will preserve the long range correlations , isotropy and homogeneity so essential for cosmology .    in this paper , we consider models that are well described by a classical , four  dimensional effective field theory long before the big crunch .",
    "the four  dimensional metric is that of a nearly homogeneous and isotropic friedmann ",
    "walker ( frw ) universe , with small perturbations to the metric , matter and kaluza  klein fields , and with the hubble radius @xmath7 much larger than the compactification length scale @xmath8 .",
    "we study the evolution of chaotic behavior as the universe contracts , including the effects of all massive kaluza ",
    "klein modes , and thus all of the degrees of freedom of the higher  dimensional theory .",
    "we show that the emergence of chaos can be controlled provided the compactification manifold @xmath9 satisfies certain topological conditions . for these topologies , the dangerous perturbations that formerly led to chaos",
    "acquire masses of order the inverse of the compactification length scale , @xmath10 .",
    "the presence of mass terms slows the growth of energy density in these fields , and prevents them from becoming cosmologically relevant so long as the hubble parameter is larger than their mass .",
    "when the time until the big crunch becomes less than @xmath8 , or equivalently @xmath11 , the suppression ceases to operate , and the energy density in the dangerous modes can grow at their usual unsuppressed rate . however , since the energy density in these heavy modes has been greatly suppressed relative to light modes up to this point , they can not dominate the energy density until the universe has contracted further by an exponential factor . typically , the massive modes do not dominate before we enter the quantum gravity regime at roughly @xmath5 , at which point the classical evolution equations can not be trusted . in these circumstances",
    ", we say that chaos has been  controlled . \"    in this paper , we focus on a classical effect which reduces the importance of chaos in compactified models .",
    "this is especially relevant for models , such as string or m  theory , in which the compactification of extra dimensions is an essential element .",
    "an excellent example is given by eleven ",
    "dimensional supergravity , whose bosonic sector contains a four  form field strength in addition to the metric . without the four  form , pure eleven ",
    "dimensional gravity is not chaotic . for some choices of the topology of the compactification manifold , it is possible to remove the light modes of the four  form field . for these topologies ,",
    "the previously chaotic eleven  dimensional supergravity theory will behave like the non  chaotic eleven  dimensional pure gravity theory .",
    "more generally , when one studies a fully uncompactified model , one finds that chaos arises from dangerous modes that are nearly spatially homogeneous along all dimensions .",
    "the energy density in these modes scales rapidly enough to dominate the universe and cause chaos .",
    "as we detail below , for some choices of the compactification manifold , the classical equations of motion forbid spatially homogeneous modes along the compact directions , for topological reasons . in the four  dimensional effective theory , this is reflected in the appearance of large mass terms for the associated degrees of freedom .",
    "as we will show , as long as the four  dimensional hubble parameter is larger than their mass , the energy density in these massive modes grows far more slowly than the energy density in the light modes which dominate the dynamics .",
    "as the hubble radius falls below the compactification length scale , the energy in the massive modes begins to grow more quickly , but due to its relative suppression , it remains dynamically irrelevant all the way to the planck time . in the present work ,",
    "we focus exclusively on the classical evolution of fields and find that it suffices to control chaos .",
    "it is possible that quantization , by imposing a further constraint on the initial perturbations , would further suppress chaos . the quantum production of heavy kaluza ",
    "klein modes is , navely at least , completely negligible all the way to the planck time .    in this work ,",
    "we consider both pure einstein gravity and models with additional matter fields .",
    "we focus on @xmath12form matter fields , with exponential couplings to a scalar  dilaton \" field @xmath13 , defined by the action , @xmath14 with @xmath15 a constant @xcite .",
    "supergravity and string models commonly include @xmath12form fields with couplings of this type . in the following , we will always use `` @xmath12 '' to denote the number of indices on the gauge potential @xmath16 .",
    "while many models that generalize four dimensional einstein gravity contain fermionic fields , throughout this work we will focus exclusively on the bosonic sector .",
    "we will also neglect more exotic terms in the @xmath12form action such as chapline ",
    "manton couplings and chern  simons terms , which at any rate we do not expect to be relevant for chaos @xcite .",
    "another important type of matter , the perfect fluid , has been discussed elsewhere @xcite , and is not affected by the compactification of extra dimensions .    in section [",
    "s : review ] , we review some results regarding the emergence of chaos during gravitational collapse that are required in later sections . this section",
    "is primarily concerned with distinguishing between chaotic and non  chaotic models .",
    "most importantly , we define the gravitational , electric and magnetic stability conditions that must be satisfied if a theory is to avoid chaotic behavior . in section",
    "[ s : cc ] , we introduce some key aspects of models with  controlled chaos , \" that are the subject of the current work .",
    "we establish that giving masses to dangerous modes prevents them from causing chaos .",
    "we then describe how the masses of these fields are determined by the compactification manifold . with these results established",
    ", we present our central new results in section [ s : msc ] .",
    "these are the  selection rules \" that determine a subset of stability conditions that must be satisfied in order to control chaos .",
    "these rules express the precise correspondence between the properties of the compactification manifold , and the chaotic behavior of the lower  dimensional theory after compactification . in section [",
    "s : examples ] , we give examples with specific compactification manifolds that are able to control chaos in vacuum einstein gravity , string theories with @xmath0 supersymmetry , and m  theory .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ s : conclusions ] , and suggest some areas for further research .",
    "the essential principle underlying the emergence of chaos is that , near a big crunch , solutions to the einstein equations are strongly unstable to perturbations .",
    "this phenomenon may be studied using a suitably general metric , such as the generalized kasner metric , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dimension of spacetime , the @xmath19 are independent of time , and the big crunch occurs at @xmath20 .",
    "the kasner exponents @xmath21 may be spatially varying , but upon substituting ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) into the einstein equations , one finds the @xmath21 are constrained by the kasner conditions , @xmath22 the first condition defines the _ kasner plane _ , the second defines the _ kasner sphere _ , and we may term their intersection the _ kasner circle_. for these anisotropic metrics it will be convenient to define the analogue of the hubble parameter in the conventional , isotropic frw solution . using ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) , the metric on equal time hypersurfaces is given by @xmath23 , allowing us to define , @xmath24 the first kasner condition implies that @xmath25 for any choice of the kasner exponents . we will find this hubble parameter a useful guide to the typical dynamical timescale of the gravitational field .",
    "the kasner metric ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) has been widely used as a tool to understand the behavior of  generic \" spacetimes near a big crunch singularity @xcite .",
    "it is an approximation , to leading order in @xmath26 , of an exact solution of the einstein equations , in which we have neglected the influence of spatial derivatives and curvature terms . to check",
    "whether this approximation is consistent , we substitute the kasner metric into the einstein equations , and check that terms corresponding to spatial derivatives and curvature appear at subleading order in @xmath26",
    ". this corresponds to spatial derivatives and curvature terms becoming irrelevant as the big crunch is approached .",
    "it has been shown rigorously @xcite and numerically @xcite that , when these terms are subleading , solutions to einstein s equations asymptotically approach kasner form as @xmath27 .",
    "a useful feature of generalized kasner universes is that the conditions determining whether the curvature terms are irrelevant can be expressed entirely in terms of the kasner exponents .",
    "the einstein tensor for the kasner metric ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) may be split into purely time derivative terms , and terms arising from the curvature of the spatial slices .",
    "details of this decomposition are given in @xcite .",
    "one finds that the time derivative terms all scale as @xmath28 , while the terms arising from spatial curvature scale as @xmath29 , for all triplets @xmath30 .",
    "dangerous components of the curvature are those whose corresponding terms in the einstein equations grow more rapidly than @xmath28 , as @xmath31 , thus invalidating the kasner approximation .",
    "these dangerous curvature terms are absent provided that the _ gravitational stability conditions _",
    ", @xmath32 are satisfied .",
    "if the stability conditions are satisfied , then the evolution is guaranteed to be smooth and kasner  like all the way to the big crunch .",
    "these conditions turn out to be very restrictive ; in the absence of matter , it is only possible to simultaneously satisfy ( [ eq : kasnercond ] ) and ( [ eq : gravstability ] ) when the spacetime dimension is greater than ten @xcite .",
    "when the gravitational stability conditions are not satisfied , then spacetime will exhibit chaotic behavior .",
    "violation of the gravitational stability conditions ( [ eq : gravstability ] ) means that the generalized kasner solution ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) is invalid , and so we must find a different description .",
    "one useful picture recasts the evolution of the metric in terms of geodesic motion of a point mass , undergoing reflections from a set of sharp walls @xcite .",
    "the free flight of the point between wall collisions is described by the kasner metric , where the kasner exponents give the momentum components of the moving point . collisions with walls correspond to spatial curvature terms temporarily dominating the einstein equations , and result in a sudden change in the kasner exponents .",
    "the motion of the point in the chamber defined by these walls is chaotic , and so the dynamics of spacetime is as well .",
    "it is useful to distinguish more precisely between the various possibilities with respect to the stability conditions ( [ eq : gravstability ] ) .",
    "a model is chaotic if the stability conditions can not be satisfied for any choice of kasner exponents satisfying the kasner conditions .",
    "we will also term models chaotic when the stability conditions are only satisfied at isolated points on the kasner circle .",
    "for example , it is possible to almost satisfy the stability conditions in any spacetime dimension with the so called  milne \" solutions , in which a single kasner exponent is unity and the rest are zero .",
    "this leads to marginally dangerous curvature components that scale exactly as @xmath28 .",
    "thus , one might argue that if these curvature components are not dominant initially , they will remain subdominant all the way to the crunch , and chaos will not arise .",
    "however , since this occurs only for isolated points on the kasner circle , any small perturbation of the kasner exponents away from the milne solution results in a violation of the stability conditions and the emergence of chaos .",
    "these solutions are thus not practically useful from the perspective of avoiding chaos in cosmological models , since they do not admit the small inhomogeneities and anisotropies that must be present in any physically realistic scenario .",
    "therefore , we consider a model non chaotic only when there exists an open region of the kasner circle in which all of the stability conditions are satisfied",
    ".    the presence of matter can either enhance or suppress chaos .",
    "three important examples are a free massless scalar field , @xmath12form fields , and perfect fluids .",
    "the first , a scalar field , suppresses chaos by modifying the kasner conditions . a homogeneous , massless scalar field @xmath13 coupled to the kasner",
    "metric will evolve as , @xmath33 with the constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 determined by the initial conditions . including the stress energy from @xmath13 in the einstein equations results in the new kasner conditions , @xmath36 while the scalar field  kasner exponent \" @xmath35 enters the kasner conditions",
    ", it does not enter the gravitational stability conditions ( [ eq : gravstability ] ) .",
    "it is now possible to find @xmath21 that satisfy these stability conditions in any spacetime dimension @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the isotropic choice , @xmath37 satisfies all of the stability conditions . moreover , there is a finite , open neighborhood on the kasner circle surrounding the isotropic solution where the stability conditions are satisfied . essentially , there are two key properties of the scalar field that enable it to suppress chaos .",
    "the scalar field has an isotropic stress energy tensor , and therefore does not enhance any preexisting anisotropy in the kasner metric .",
    "also , the scalar field energy density scales as @xmath28 , and thus grows sufficiently rapidly to remain relevant near the big crunch .",
    "the addition of @xmath12form fields coupled to @xmath13 tends to enhance chaos .",
    "a @xmath12form field strength with @xmath38 has an anisotropic stress energy tensor , which tends to enhance any preexisting anisotropy in the kasner metric .",
    "if the @xmath12form field dominates the energy density , then it tends to drive the universe to anisotropic oscillations and then chaos .",
    "a homogeneous @xmath12form evolves simply , and its dynamics depend on whether it has a time index ( an electric @xmath12form ) or whether all indices are spatial ( a magnetic @xmath12form ) . using the equation of motion and the bianchi identity , one finds , @xmath39 using these solutions , we may construct the stress energy tensor for the @xmath12 form field , and compare its time dependence with the @xmath28 leading dependence of the homogeneous terms in the einstein equations .",
    "note that , unlike the scalar field , we do not include the gravitational back ",
    "reaction from the @xmath12form fields , and merely check if it remains subdominant if subdominant initially .",
    "one finds that the @xmath12form energy scales more slowly than @xmath28 , and therefore can not cause chaos , when the following _ @xmath12form stability conditions _ are satisfied ;    [ eq : ebstability ] @xmath40    the electric conditions involve a sum of @xmath12 distinct kasner exponents , corresponding to the @xmath12 spatial indices of an electric @xmath12form field strength .",
    "the magnetic conditions likewise involve a sum over @xmath41 distinct kasner exponents .",
    "thus , for each @xmath12 or @xmath42tuple of kasner exponents , there will be a corresponding stability condition .",
    "the inequalities ( [ eq : ebstability ] ) are often referred to individually as the _ electric _ or _ magnetic stability conditions_. if they are violated , then chaos will arise .    the inclusion of a matter component with @xmath4 can suppress chaos @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 fluid suppresses chaos by growing rapidly to dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "once it dominates , the power  law kasner solution ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) is replaced by a solution of the approximate form , @xmath44 } \\sum_{j=1}^{d-1 }   \\exp { \\left ( c_j t^{\\frac{w-1}{w+1 } } \\right ) } ( \\sigma_j)^2\\ ] ] where the @xmath45 are arbitrary constants .",
    "when @xmath46 , this solution converges rapidly to isotropy as @xmath31 . near the big crunch",
    ", this solution may be thought of as a kasner universe with kasner exponents , @xmath47 the gravitational stability conditions are clearly satisfied in this case , and thus chaos does not arise .",
    "the @xmath12form case is somewhat more subtle , and depends on whether we realize the @xmath48 fluid by introducing a potential for the dilaton @xmath13 , or as a separate matter component that does not couple to the @xmath12forms . in either case , for any @xmath12form and coupling @xmath15 , there is a corresponding @xmath49 , for which chaos is eliminated when @xmath50 .",
    "in this section , we will distinguish a subclass of the chaotic models , those with  controlled \" chaos .",
    "the salient feature of controlled chaos is that dangerous modes are suppressed , relative to @xmath28 , for an adjustable epoch of cosmic history . in these models ,",
    "dangerous modes acquire a mass @xmath51 , and their contribution to the total energy density of the universe is suppressed so long as @xmath52 .",
    "these masses arise through compactification , and are of order @xmath53 , with @xmath8 the characteristic length scale of the compactification manifold @xmath9 . in a universe with kasner metric ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) , @xmath25 .",
    "thus , in these models chaos can not emerge until @xmath54 , and is is possible to ensure that chaos does not arise before the planck time @xmath5 . in section [ ss : massandmassless ] , we discuss how the growth of dangerous modes is suppressed by mass terms , and estimate the suppression factor .",
    "we give a simple argument based on a scalar field in an isotropic universe , leaving a discussion of the general @xmath12form case to appendix 1 .",
    "sections [ ss : pformspectrum ] and [ ss : gravityspectrum ] describe the mechanism by which compactification gives the required masses to @xmath12form and metric degrees of freedom . in both cases , massless modes in the lower dimension",
    "can only exist when @xmath9 admits @xmath12form or vector fields with certain special properties . in section [ s : msc ] , we use these results to give the  selection rules \" that express the correspondence between these special properties of @xmath9 and the chaotic properties of the compactified theory .    in the following , we assume that spacetime has the form @xmath55 , with @xmath9 a compact manifold . indices @xmath56 denote directions in the total spacetime @xmath55 , while @xmath57 denotes directions along @xmath58 and @xmath59 along @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath60 denotes the total metric , with @xmath61 the metric on @xmath58 and @xmath62 the metric on @xmath9 . in later sections we will need to distinguish between coordinate indices and tangent space indices on @xmath55 .",
    "we use @xmath63 for tangent space indices along the full space , @xmath64 for those along @xmath58 , and @xmath65 for those along @xmath9 .",
    "the suppression of massive modes in a collapsing universe may be illustrated using the equation of state @xmath66 .",
    "this is defined as the ratio of the pressure to energy density for a perfect fluid , @xmath67 where we assume that we are in the comoving frame where the stress energy tensor is diagonal . as we are primarily interested in cosmological models , it is sufficient to consider the case where the universe is an isotropic , four dimensional frw model after compactification .",
    "conservation of stress energy implies that the energy density @xmath68 of a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath66 depends on the scale factor @xmath69 as , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the energy density when @xmath69 is unity . in a contracting universe ,",
    "the component with the largest @xmath66 grows most rapidly , and eventually dominates the total energy density .",
    "a homogeneous , massive scalar field has a perfect fluid stress energy with equation of state , @xmath72 from equations ( [ eq : rhowitha ] ) and ( [ eq : w4scalar ] ) it is readily seen that the energy density of a massive scalar field must scale more slowly than that of a massless one .",
    "a massless scalar field will always have @xmath3 , and thus its energy density @xmath68 scales with @xmath69 as @xmath73 .",
    "the energy density of a massive scalar will scale with an effective @xmath66 between zero and unity , depending on the ratio @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath75 , far from the big crunch , the scalar field s dynamics is dominated by the mass term in its potential . using @xmath76 to denote the time average , the virial theorem implies that @xmath77 , and therefore @xmath78 @xcite . thus the energy density in the massive field scales as @xmath79 , far more slowly than the massless field .",
    "near the crunch , when @xmath80 , the mass term has a negligible effect on the field s dynamics .",
    "in this limit , @xmath81 , and @xmath66 approaches unity from below . in this regime , the energy density in massive and massless fields will scale identically with time .    using this equation of state argument",
    ", we can estimate the exponential suppression of the energy density in massive fields .",
    "the basic process by which dangerous modes are suppressed , and then grow near the big crunch is illustrated in figure [ f : diffrhoscaling ] .",
    "although we have discussed only the scalar case above , the same @xmath78 scaling when @xmath52 obtains for general @xmath12form fields , as discussed in appendix 1 , and so this estimate applies to those fields as well .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , while the energy density in massive modes is always growing , it grows more slowly than the @xmath28 scaling required for the field to be cosmologically relevant .",
    "therefore , if we wish to estimate the importance of a given energy component , we should consider the ratio of the energy density in the component to @xmath28 .",
    "this quantity , @xmath82 , may be thought of as measuring the ratio of the energy density in a given component to the total density , for , @xmath83 where we have used planck units .",
    "only when @xmath82 is increasing as @xmath27 can a given component grow to dominate the universe .",
    "we begin by choosing a reference time @xmath84 , at the beginning of the contracting phase .",
    "we consider a model where the four  dimensional effective theory begins to contract with a background equation of state @xmath85 , so that , @xmath86 where we have normalized @xmath87 when @xmath88 . combining this with ( [ eq : rhowitha ] ) , one finds that for massive modes , @xmath89_0 \\cdot ( t / t_0)^{\\frac{2\\bar w}{1+\\bar   w } } , \\qquad ( m / h > 1),\\ ] ] where @xmath90_0 $ ] denotes @xmath82 evaluated at @xmath84 .",
    "this equation is valid up until @xmath91 , when the mass terms are becoming irrelevant . denoting by @xmath92 the time at which @xmath93 , one finds , @xmath94 where we have taken @xmath95 . we then have , @xmath96_1 = \\left [ t^2 \\rho(t ) \\right]_0   \\cdot ( r_c h_0)^{\\frac{2\\bar w}{1+\\bar w } } , \\qquad ( m / h \\sim 1).\\ ] ] this equation shows the suppression in the fractional energy density in massive modes during the period in which @xmath52 .",
    "the suppression is controlled by the ratio of the compactification length scale @xmath8 to the hubble horizon @xmath97 at the beginning of the contracting phase .    as we approach the big crunch , we have @xmath98 , and the dangerous modes can grow as usual . we parameterize this growth by an exponent @xmath99 , so that , @xmath100_1 , \\qquad ( m / h < 1).\\ ] ] when @xmath101 , a mode will grow and eventually dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "one can see by comparing ( [ eq : dangergro ] ) to our discussion in section [ s : review ] that @xmath99 is merely twice the amount by which a given mode violates the stability conditions .",
    "typically , @xmath99 will be of order one .",
    "now we define a time @xmath102 , at which the dangerous modes have grown sufficiently so that the fractional energy density in dangerous modes is equal to that at the beginning of the contracting phase , or , @xmath103_{eq } = \\left [ t^2 \\rho(t ) \\right]_0.\\ ] ] using ( [ eq : rhoathism ] ) and ( [ eq : dangergro ] ) , we find , @xmath104 finally , we define a time @xmath105 , at which the dangerous modes formally dominate the universe , corresponding to @xmath106",

    "having established the formulae we will need for our estimate , we may now insert reasonable values for our variables .",
    "let us assume the contraction phase begins when the hubble parameter is of order the present value @xmath109 ( as occurs in ekpyrotic and cyclic models ) .",
    "then , @xmath110 @xmath111 . as a first example , we assume that @xmath112 during the contraction as is characteristic of compactifications of kasner universes .",
    "a typical value for @xmath99 that arises from working with the @xmath12form spectrum of string models and gravity is @xmath113 , although the precise value of @xmath99 will of course depend on the specific model under consideration .",
    "if we take @xmath114 , as an example , then we find the suppression factor ( [ eq : rhoathism ] ) at @xmath115 to be , @xmath116 the dangerous modes grow to have the same fractional energy density as they had at the beginning of the contracting phase at the time , @xmath117 thus , the dangerous modes can not grow to be even as relevant as at the beginning of cosmic contraction , until the universe is well within the quantum regime . we would need to approach even closer to the big crunch for these modes to dominate the universe , but at this point we no longer expect our classical equations to be valid .    as another example , we consider a case with large compact dimensions , where @xmath51 is of order the weak scale , @xmath118 @xmath119 , which corresponds to taking @xmath120 @xmath111 .",
    "now we find that the suppression when the hubble radius equals the compactification scale is , @xmath121 and , @xmath122 again , we will be well within the quantum gravity regime before the dangerous modes can potentially dominate .",
    "if @xmath123 during the contraction phase , as occurs in ekpyrotic and cyclic models , the dangerous modes are suppressed by a much greater factor than in these examples , as is evident from the expressions above .    as a final relevant issue",
    ", note that we have taken the mass @xmath51 of the dangerous modes to be constant in time .",

    "it is clear that there is a potential problem if @xmath133 , which would lead to @xmath134 increasing during the contracting phase .",

    "this implies that @xmath138 , and so the suppression operates as before .",
    "having established that the massless modes are the only relevant modes near the big crunch , we now describe how these massless modes are determined in terms of the compactification manifold @xmath9 .",
    "the story is familiar from the study of higher  dimensional models of particle physics @xcite although we discuss some special features of the time dependent situation which must be taken into account .",
    "an useful feature of the @xmath12form mass spectrum is that the existence of massless modes is determined entirely by the topology of @xmath9 , and not by its metric .",

    "first , we will review the situation for the time independent case . for clarity",

    "this demonstrates that a single @xmath12form in @xmath140 dimensions yields many @xmath148forms @xmath149 after compactification , whose masses @xmath157 are related to the eigenvalues @xmath153 by @xmath158 .",
    "these are the  kaluza",
    " klein \" modes .",
    "the operator @xmath159 has a positive semi",
    " definite spectrum on manifolds which , like @xmath9 , have a euclidean metric . therefore the effective masses are all real .",
    "the @xmath160forms with zero effective mass are determined entirely by the topology of @xmath9 , and not by its metric structure .",
    "as discussed above , massless @xmath160forms arise from @xmath144forms @xmath161 satisfying @xmath162 , conventionally termed  harmonic \" forms . hodge s",
    "theorem @xcite states that the number of harmonic @xmath144forms is equal to the dimension of @xmath163 , the @xmath164 de rham cohomology class of @xmath9 . the dimension @xmath165 is also known as the @xmath164 betti number of @xmath9 , conventionally denoted @xmath166 .",
    "this is a topological invariant , which does not change under smooth deformations of @xmath9 and its associated metric structure .",
    "the poincar duality theorem @xcite gives a simple geometric interpretation of these cohomology classes ; the quantity @xmath167 counts the number of @xmath144dimensional submanifolds that can  wrap \" @xmath9 , and can not be smoothly contracted to zero . in this",
    "counting , two submanifolds are considered equivalent if one can be smoothly deformed into the other .",
    "thus , for every inequivalent noncontractible submanifold of @xmath9 with dimension @xmath144 , a @xmath12form gives rise to a massless @xmath160form field after compactification .",
    "the case where the compactification manifold @xmath9 changes with time introduces new features , but in the end does not substantially modify the conclusions reached above .",
    "the main difference is that it is no longer possible to assume that the eigenbasis of forms @xmath145 defined by ( [ eq : eigenforms ] ) depends only on the compact coordinates @xmath168 . in particular",
    ", the forms will depend on time .",
    "this introduces additional cross terms which must be taken into account .",
    "below , we will neglect the variation of @xmath9 along directions @xmath169 other than time .",
    "we denote by @xmath170 the exterior derivative tangent to the manifold @xmath9 .",
    "thus , @xmath171 we may now use our freedom to choose the basis modes @xmath145 , and define the modes @xmath172 with @xmath173 to be the instantaneous eigenforms of the hodge  de rham operator , restricted to act on @xmath9 only , @xmath174 we find it convenient to relax the requirement that the zero modes @xmath172 with @xmath175 be eigenforms of the hodge  de rham laplacian .",
    "instead , we will merely require that they be representatives of the de rham cohomology of @xmath9 .",
    "inspection of the reduced action shows that this condition is sufficient to guarantee that the zero modes still result in massless form fields .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the normalization convention , @xmath176 this differs from the usual normalization convention ( [ eq : staticnorm ] ) by only a multiplicative constant in the static case .",
    "it has the advantage of not introducing any spurious time dependence of the @xmath145 from the changing volume of @xmath9 .",
    "maintaining this normalization condition requires , @xmath177 with these conventions and definitions , we find that the @xmath12form action ( [ eq : pformaction ] ) splits into two parts , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , with @xmath180 and , @xmath181 where terms that are identically zero due to mismatched indices are not included .",
    "again , we have rescaled the @xmath149 to obtain canonically normalized kinetic terms .",
    "the terms in @xmath179 threaten to substantially modify the action in the time dependent case .",
    "however , these terms vanish or are negligible .",
    "the first term is zero due to our normalization convention ( [ eq : timednorm ] ) and its consequence ( [ eq : timednorm2 ] ) .",
    "the second term is a contribution to the effective mass of @xmath149 . for the @xmath175 modes , the representatives @xmath182 of the de rham cohomology are time  independent , and",
    "so the @xmath183 terms vanish .",
    "when @xmath184 , the additional contribution to the effective mass will be positive , but since these modes are already massive it will not change the qualitative features of their behavior .",
    "thus , time dependent compactifications do not substantially modify the @xmath12form spectrum ; massless modes are still given by the de rham cohomology of @xmath9 .      a key property of kaluza ",
    "klein reduction is that degrees of freedom in the full metric @xmath60 appear in lower dimensions as metric , vector , and scalar degrees of freedom . as in the @xmath12form compactification discussed above , the masses of these fields depend on the properties of the compactification manifold @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath12form case , the masses are not determined by the cohomology of @xmath9 , but by the existence of killing fields on @xmath9 .",
    "the properties of kaluza  klein reduction , along with our discussion of chaos in section [ s : review ] , provide some useful simplifications . since some of the metric degrees of freedom in the higher dimensional theory appear as zero and one  forms , chaos arising from these degrees of freedom can be suppressed if they acquire a mass , just as in the conventional @xmath12form case .    as an explicit example of the reduction process , and of how chaos in higher and lower dimensions",
    "are related , we consider below the simple case with a single extra dimension @xcite .",
    "the kaluza  klein reduction begins with a reparameterization of the metric , @xmath185 where we assume that @xmath186 and @xmath13 are independent of the fifth dimension .",
    "we substitute this metric into the einstein ",
    "hilbert action and integrate over the fifth dimension .",
    "the coefficient @xmath187 is chosen so that the scalar field @xmath13 has a canonically normalized kinetic term in the resulting action , @xmath188 with @xmath189 .",
    "this describes einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field @xmath13 , and a vector field with @xmath13dependent coupling .",
    "it can be seen that all of the five  dimensional metric degrees of freedom in ( [ eq : kkreparam ] ) are reproduced in this four  dimensional action .",
    "furthermore , the vector term in the action possesses an exponential coupling to @xmath13 , of the type introduced in ( [ eq : pformdef ] ) .",
    "our starting point , the five dimensional pure gravity theory , is chaotic since the gravitational stability conditions can not be satisfied for any choice of the kasner exponents . after reduction , chaos also inevitably arises since the gravitational and one  form stability conditions can not be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "thus violations of the gravitational stability conditions in five dimensions can appear as violations of the @xmath12form stability conditions in four dimensions . as we will discuss in more detail below",
    ", the preservation of chaos is not a generic feature of kaluza ",
    "klein reduction in dimensions greater than one .",
    "the example above is limited to a single extra dimension , and neglects metric modes that depend on the fifth coordinate .",
    "below , we consider the general case , and calculate the effective masses of all kaluza ",
    "klein vector fields with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions .",
    "we will find that these masses are zero only when @xmath9 possesses killing vectors .",
    "this calculation parallels standard treatments of kaluza  klein reduction @xcite , but in these treatments the fact that @xmath9 may not possess isometries is often not emphasized . for @xmath190 extra dimensions , we will generalize the decomposition ( [ eq : kkreparam ] ) using the vielbein formalism .",

    "the coefficients in this expansion are the @xmath200 , which depend only the noncompact coordinates @xmath201 .",
    "the @xmath200 , known as kaluza  klein vectors , will emerge after compactification as vector fields on the noncompact space @xmath58 .",
    "the commutators of the @xmath198 define a set of structure constants @xmath202 , @xmath203 = { f^{jk}}_{l } k^l .\\ ] ] the calculation is most conveniently carried out using an orthonormal basis @xmath204 given by , @xmath205 in which the line element assumes the simple form @xmath206 . in the event that some of the @xmath198 are killing fields on @xmath9 , then the lower dimensional theory will possess a gauge symmetry .",
    "the killing fields are generators of the isometry group of @xmath9 , and this isometry group reemerges as the gauge group in the lower dimensional theory .",
    "this motivates the definition of a  field strength \" @xmath207 as , @xmath208 in the general case , the killing fields alone do not provide a full basis for vector fields on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in addition to the massless modes ( if any ) of the gauge theory , there will also be an infinite set of massive gauge fields in the lower dimensional theory .    in order to derive the mass spectrum in the lower dimension explicitly",
    ", we may use the vielbeins to decompose the gravitational action in @xmath140 dimensions .",
    "the spin connections are ,    @xmath209    where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the spin connections defined by the metrics @xmath62 on @xmath9 , and @xmath61 on @xmath58 , respectively . using these spin connections to compute the ricci scalar , one obtains , @xmath212",
    "we see that a mass term for the @xmath213 has appeared . upon integrating over",
    "the compact coordinates , one arrives at the jordan frame action , @xmath214 where ,    [ eq : jordanactionbits ] @xmath215    the @xmath216 factor may be removed by a rescaling of the metric @xmath61 , putting the action in the einstein frame form .",

    ", we see kaluza  klein reduction of pure gravity results in a theory with scalars and vector fields , generalizing the @xmath220 result discussed above .    of crucial importance to the present work is that massless kaluza ",
    "klein vectors are in one  to  one correspondence with killing fields on @xmath9 , or equivalently the zero eigenvalues of @xmath221 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath221 functions as a mass matrix for the kaluza ",
    "klein vector fields .",
    "since @xmath221 is symmetric , we are guaranteed that @xmath222 will be real for all modes . in our discussion of @xmath12form fields",
    ", we were able to apply powerful results regarding the hodge  de rham operator @xmath223 that guaranteed that @xmath224 , regardless of the topology and metric structure of @xmath9 . in the present situation",

    "we will assume that all eigenvalues of the mass matrix are nonnegative , so that @xmath224 for all kaluza ",
    "klein vectors . in the general case",

    "once established , we will use them to find compactifications that control chaos in section [ s : examples ] .",
    "the discussion in section [ s : cc ] enables us to define selection rules for the electric and magnetic stability conditions .",
    "each component of the @xmath12form field results in an electric or magnetic stability condition , which expresses whether the energy density in that component scales rapidly enough to dominate the energy density of the universe and cause chaos .",
    "if this component gains a mass by compactification , then we have shown that it scales too slowly to be cosmologically relevant , and therefore we should ignore the corresponding stability condition .",

    "since only stability conditions of this type correspond to massless modes , they are the only ones that should be retained .",

    "nonzero modes \" @xcite .",
    "the conditions ( [ eq : nonzeromodes ] ) imply that @xmath248 is harmonic , and by hodge s theorem the number of such forms is given by @xmath249 .",

    "thus this case falls under the @xmath12form selection rule as well .",
    "the selection rule may be illustrated by comparing compactification on a sphere @xmath250 and a torus @xmath227 .",

    "the sphere has the minimum number of massless modes for any orientable compact manifold , while the torus has massless modes for every dimension and involving every combination of indices on @xmath9 .",

    "the sphere has only two nonzero cohomology groups , each of unit dimension ; @xmath256 the class @xmath257 is generated by the constant scalar function on @xmath250 , while the class @xmath258 is generated by the volume form , @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the metric , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 the coordinates on the sphere .",
    "massless modes therefore contain either no indices along the @xmath250 , or all indices at once .",
    "this implies that the only surviving stability conditions are those with either no internal kasner exponents , or all internal kasner exponents together . in the case where @xmath263 , none of the internal kasner exponents appear at all , and only those stability conditions involving kasner exponents on @xmath58 survive .",
    "our statement of the selection rule is the strongest possible in the generic case , and fortunately also the most conservative in terms of deleting the minimum number of stability conditions .",
    "manifolds with a specific relationship between the frames @xmath264 appearing in ( [ eq : genkasner ] ) and the cohomology representatives of @xmath9 may require that we delete additional @xmath12form stability conditions . for example , consider the case in which @xmath9 factors as @xmath265 , both topologically and metrically .",
    "a straightforward application of the selection rules results in retaining all stability conditions with @xmath144 indices along @xmath9 whenever @xmath266 .",

    "the control of chaos can be expressed simply in terms of selection rules for the gravitational and @xmath12form stability conditions .",
    "these in turn can be used to find compactifications of chaotic theories in which chaos is suppressed right up to the quantum gravity regime .",
    "our results bear an intriguing connection to some cosmological models that are founded on current ideas in string and m  theory . among the simple examples of string theory solutions with controlled chaos , we find those that resemble both the ekpyrotic / cyclic and pre  big bang scenarios . for future models",

    "while this work sheds no light on the behavior of these models in the quantum gravity regime or through the big crunch / big bang transition , it provides a natural mechanism that ensures that the universe evolves smoothly so long as classical physics may be trusted .",
    "recent work suggests that maintaining this smooth contraction during the classical regime may be sufficient to allow a nonsingular quantum evolution through a big crunch / big bang transition .",
    "one approach to this problem @xcite begins from the fact that , in string and m  theory , the degrees of freedom during the quantum regime are very different from those of the classical regime studied here .",
    "the fundamental degrees of freedom are extended objects , such as strings and branes . as one approaches",
    "the scale set by their tension , classical general relativity breaks down , and these extended objects become the relevant degrees of freedom . in particular , it is the evolution of these strings and branes that one should study near the big crunch .",
    "working within the context of the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario , it was found in ref @xcite that if the universe is sufficiently smooth and homogeneous at the beginning of the quantum regime , the fundamental excitations ( m2 branes ) evolve smoothly through the big crunch with negligible backreaction .",
    "this suggests that a sufficiently smooth  in \" state can evolve through the big crunch to a smooth  out \" state , precisely what one requires for cosmology .",
    "this result complements the present work .",

    "our results have further implications for high energy theory and phenomenology .",
    "string models and m  theory require compactification in order to produce the correct number of observed noncompact dimensions .",
    "obtaining the correct low energy physics , such as @xmath312 supersymmetry in four dimensions or the correct number of lepton generations , puts constraints on the compactification manifold @xmath9 , many of which are topological in nature . controlling chaos through compactification in cosmological models with a collapsing phase places additional constraints on @xmath9 .",
    "we are currently investigating whether these two set of constraints are compatible .",
    "for example , the existence of solutions with compactification on a calabi  yau space would suggest that chaos can be controlled in string models with a realistic low energy spectrum .",
    "these results also inspire more speculative scenarios .",
    "when the universe enters a chaotic regime , the kasner exponents will undergo an infinite number of  jumps \" to different points on the kasner sphere as the big crunch is approached .",
    "we also might expect that the topology of @xmath9 is changing at the same time .",
    "for example , there are situations in string theory where the topology of @xmath9 can change dynamically , such as the conifold or flop transitions . if the combination of kasner exponents and topology lead to controlled chaos , then the universe will subsequently contract smoothly to the big crunch .",
    "in this way , the universe will have dynamically selected not only some properties of @xmath9 , but also a  preferred \" cosmological solution near the big crunch .",

    "below , we treat the case of a general @xmath12form field with coupling to the dilaton @xmath13 , in a collapsing universe . we concern ourselves with the case where spacetime is isotropic , as this is the cosmologically relevant situation after compactification .",

    "we will choose the coloumb gauge , in which @xmath325 and drop this constraint term from now on .",
    "the hamiltonian is in fact exactly that of a set of simple harmonic oscillators .",
    "after decomposing the functions @xmath16 in an appropriate orthonormal set of fourier components , different fourier modes decouple and the hamiltonian is quadratic in @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "the electric field modes appear as the kinetic terms , and the magnetic field and mass terms correspond to the potential of the oscillators .",
    "the oscillator potential is time dependent , both due to the appearance of @xmath328 and individual metric components in the magnetic and mass terms .",
    "we are primarily interested in the dynamics of the @xmath12form far from the big crunch . in this regime",
    ", we may view the changing scale factors as slowly varying parameters in our hamiltonian .",
    "they will change the spring constants on a timescale given by @xmath26 , the proper time to the big crunch .",
    "the dynamical timescale ( typical period ) for the oscillator hamiltonian is given by the mass term .",
    "thus , we expect that the fractional change in the fundamental frequencies @xmath329 of the oscillator system over a typical cycle will be , @xmath330 provided we are at a time @xmath331 , we will be in the adiabatic regime , and we may take the oscillation frequencies to be constants .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath75 regime that we have concerned ourselves with throughout this paper .    to find how the energy density scales with time",
    ", we apply the virial theorem and stress energy conservation .",
    "the adiabatic condition ( [ eq : adiabatic ] ) implies that we may neglect the time variation of the metric and dilaton over a single cycle .",
    "for our hamiltonian , the virial theorem then implies that the time average @xmath76 of the potential energy is equal to that of the kinetic energy , or @xmath332 in the virialized system , there are two possible regimes , corresponding to either the @xmath333 term or the @xmath334 term dominating .",
    "we will consider both of these cases in turn .",

    "thus the contributions to the energy density @xmath340 are all positive .",
    "first , we consider the case where the mass term dominates in the virial relationship ( [ eq : pformvirial ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to inhomogeneities in the @xmath12form field being negligible .",
    "the virial result implies that @xmath341 . due to our gauge choice",
    ", @xmath327 and @xmath342 have the same combination of @xmath12 spatial indices , and therefore contributions to the pressure components @xmath343 coming from @xmath344 and @xmath345 exactly cancel .",
    "the vanishing pressure reveals that the effective equation of state is that of dust , @xmath78 .",
    "when the magentic terms dominate the virial result ( [ eq : pformvirial ] ) , we obtain a slightly different effective equation of state . here",
    "it is necessary to average over polarizations of @xmath321 , since unlike @xmath342 and @xmath327 , @xmath342 and @xmath322 do not enjoy any relationships between their indices .",
    "regardless of polarization , the sum of stress energy tensors @xmath346 and @xmath347 has vanishing trace .",
    "this , combined with isotropy , implies the pressure components are given by @xmath348 .",
    "this corresponds to the equation of state of radiation , which in four dimensional spacetime is @xmath349 .",
    "physically , this result may be understood in simple terms .",
    "far from the big crunch , the contraction of space is very slow in comparison to the mass of the @xmath12form field .",
    "thus , the corresponding particles are far from being relativistic , and behave as a dust of approximately comoving mass points .",
    "their energy density therefore scales in inverse proportion to the comoving volume .",
