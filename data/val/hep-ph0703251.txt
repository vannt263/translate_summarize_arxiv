    "the search for new physics beyond the standard model in the future will follow two main paths : higher energy and high ",
    "intensity  @xcite .",
    "neutrino facilities will play an important role in this program : neutrino masses take us beyond the standard model , and a full determination of the pattern of @xmath1 masses and mixing will require dedicated high  intensity neutrino beams  @xcite .",
    "however , a high  intensity @xmath1 beam can be used not only to study neutrino properties , but also as a sensitive probe of the electroweak interaction .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that a wide spectrum of otherwise very difficult or impossible measurements of strong and electroweak processes would become possible at a high  energy neutrino factory  @xcite .",
    "here we start addressing the issue whether equally interesting measurements might also be possible with a _ low energy _ but sufficiently intense @xmath1 beam .",
    "indeed , the main role so far of low  energy tests of the standard model  @xcite has been in the study of rare processes . here",
    "we will investigate whether with sufficiently high  intensity they may lead to competitive measurements of standard model parameters , specifically the electroweak mixing angle .",
    "the development of future neutrino facilities is driven by the study of neutrino masses and mixings , and will happen in three stages . in",
    "the first phase various facilities will produce conventional @xmath1 beams from the decay of a secondary meson beam ( producing typically @xmath2 @xmath1/year ) .",
    "examples of such facilities ( now under construction or just commissioned ) are minos and no@xmath1a , the cern / gran sasso beam , and t2k . in the second stage ,",
    "planned for the beginning of the next decade , `` superbeams '' , i.e. conventional beams but with intensities about hundred times higher , should be constructed , exploiting very high  intensity , and relatively low energy primary proton beams .",
    "examples of such facilities are the second phase of t2k , exploiting a 50 gev and 7 mw proton synchrotron at jparc , and a possible high  energy superbeam at cern exploiting a 3.5  gev , 45  mw superconducting proton linac ( spl ) . in the third phase , starting perhaps towards the end of the next decade , neutrinos from decays of a _ primary _ beam are planned .",
    "two possible kinds of primary beams are envisaged : either a neutrino factory , i.e. relatively high  energy ( tens of gev ) muon beam , or a @xmath0beam , i.e. relatively low  energy ( few gev ) radioactive nuclei .",
    "the advantage of using a primary beam are higher intensity and a better control on the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 beam has the further advantage of giving a pure beam of electronic @xmath1 or @xmath3 , with essentially no contamination from @xmath4 or wrong  sign neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino factory gives a beam which is exactly 50% @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "because neutrinos only couple to weak interactions , they are an ideal probe of electroweak parameters , specifically of the electroweak mixing angle ( weinberg angle ) which controls the relative strength of neutral ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) couplings .",
    "electron elastic scattering offers an ideally clean setting for this measurement , which is competitive at a high energy neutrino factory  @xcite , but ( because the cross section grows linearly with the energy ) at a low  energy facility very high intensities are required  @xcite",
    ". a measurement of the weinberg angle can be obtained from the cc / nc deep - inelastic scattering ratio : this measurement at present is almost competitive , but marred by the uncertainty related to parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "it would certainly be competitive at a neutrino factory  @xcite .",
    "as the energy is lowered , the relative ( quasi)elastic contribution to the total cross section grows , and at an energy @xmath7 the elastic and inelastic contribution are of comparable size ( see fig .",
    "[ xsect ] ) . at this energy ,",
    "at which perturbative treatment of inelastic contribution breaks down anyway , the relative elastic contribution is sizable , while total cross section is still reasonably large .",
    "this energy is relevant for future facilities , such as jparc , a low ",
    "energy @xmath0 beam or the spl superbeam , and it is natural to ask whether elastic or quasielastic scattering can be used for competitive measurements of weinberg angle .    nucleon cross sections vs. energy . ]",
    "[ xsect ]    the answer is not obvious , because ( quasi)elastic cross sections depend on eight independent form factors  @xcite : two pairs of electric and magnetic form factors for proton and neutron targets , a pair of strange electric and magnetic form factors ( the same for protons and neutrons ) and a pair of axial isotriplet and strange form factors ( the same for protons and neutrons , up to signs ) .",
    "the question is then whether the uncertainty in the form factors knowledge spoils the extraction of @xmath8 from these cross sections .",
    "the simplest answer to the above question is obtained by a counting of the relevant physical observables . with proton and neutron ( from deuterium or other nuclei ) targets and @xmath1 and @xmath9 beams",
    ", one can measure four independent nc and two independent cc cross sections .",
    "they depend on eight form factors and the weinberg angle .",
    "hence , at least three form factors have to be input to the analysis .",
    "it is convenient to input the electric form factors , whose forward value is fixed by charge .    assuming a flux @xmath10 with energy @xmath11  gev one gets @xmath12 elastic cc events and @xmath13 nc events with either beam or target after one year of running with each beam .",
    "this flux and energy are typical e.g. of a low ",
    "energy @xmath0beam , with a detector located at a distance of @xmath14  km .",
    "assuming that the five independent form factors and the weinberg angle are determined in each angular bin this leads to a statistical error @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the further theoretical error due to the electric form factor is negligible .",
    "it is important to observe that these form factors must be input if one wishes to extract all the other form factors and @xmath16 .",
    "however , the cross section can actually be measured in a large number of angular ( or @xmath17 ) bins ( e.g. several dozens ) .",
    "one may thus choose to parametrize the form factors and fit these parameters as well as @xmath16 . clearly , with , say , 20 bins and several cross sections even with a very general parametrization all form factors can be determined together with the weinberg angle .",
    "this suggests that a more detailed analysis is worthwhile .",
    "the main experimental constraint is the possibility to detect cc and nc events with a neutrino beam energy between one and a few gev .",
    "this rules out water cherenkov detectors , because the cherenkov threshold @xmath18 for the recoiling proton implies that only protons with recoil momentum @xmath19  gev can be detected , which removes most of the cross section .",
    "a more promising alternative is a liquid ar tpc  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the only constraint is that the recoiling proton leaves a sufficiently long track so that it is not confused with nucleon motion due to nuclear effects .",
    "this gives a constraint on the proton energy @xmath20  mev i.e. @xmath21  mev . with a beam energy of the order of 1 gev ,",
    "about 75% of the scattering events survives this kinematic cut .",
    "however , recoiling neutrons can not be detected .",
    "this implies that neutron neutral current ( nc ) events are essentially lost and one is left with only four independent cross sections .    in order to maximize the flux",
    ", one may envisage the option of having a near detector , located at a few hundreds of meters from the source , thereby obtaining fluxes by many orders of magnitude larger than those at the far detector used for oscillations studies .",
    "however , in a realistic analysis one should keep into account that an argon tpc might have difficulties in handling interaction rates much larger than a few events per spill .",
    "this would put a bound on the maximum flux .      in order to get a more quantitative estimate of the accuracy",
    "one can reach in the weinberg angle determination , we have generated scattering events assuming an incoming flux @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with fixed energy @xmath24  gev .",
    "these parameters are typical e.g. of t2k ( first phase ) with a near detector at about 300  m from the source . in the present analysis we have considered the case of a liquid argon detector with a mass of 10  ktons .",
    "an increase in the detector mass would correspond to a reduction in the fit uncertainty that can be easily obtained by standard statistical analysis .",
    "we have assumed @xmath25 and all the nucleon form factors as given in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the axial and strange form factors ; in particular for the strange magnetic form factor we used @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the neutrino momentum transfer , @xmath28 , @xmath29 nucleon mass , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    we have then performed a fit to the events thus generated , leaving as free parameters @xmath16 and the forward value of the strange magnetic form factor @xmath32 .",
    "we have then repeated this fit by varying the value of the forward strange axial form factor @xmath33 , considering one @xmath34 variation around its central value ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "these are the only forward form factors which are affected by a significant uncertainty .",
    "other form factor parameters have a more moderate impact .",
    "we get @xmath36 , where the systematic error is due to the variation of the strange axial form factor within the range indicated .",
    "clearly , a more detailed analysis  @xcite would require either fitting of all form factors , or varying some of their parameters within errors .",
    "in such an analysis we will also introduce a study of the systematical uncertainty related to the choice of the form factor parametrization .",
    "however , on the basis of this first estimates , we conclude that a determination of @xmath16 with an uncertainty of a few percent is not unreasonable .",
