    "in the last two decades , a significant amount of observational and theoretical effort has been dedicated towards the understanding of an `` unusual '' class of pulsars , namely the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "these relatively bright x - ray sources ( @xmath1ergs@xmath2 ) , discovered either as peculiar short x - ray bursts or steady x - ray emitters , were soon recognised as a distinct class of neutron stars with respect to the well known radio pulsar or x - ray binary populations ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the arguments that lead to this conclusion are the following : first , axps and sgrs are x - ray pulsators with spin periods in the range 5 - 12s .",
    "furthermore , their rotational energy loss @xmath3 inferred from their spin - down rate ( @xmath4 , where i , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the neutron star moment of inertia , angular velocity and angular velocity time derivative ) is insufficient to power the observed x - ray luminosity ( note that for the large majority of isolated pulsars , detected both in radio and x - ray band , the x - ray luminosity is typically 0.1% of the @xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , there is no evidence for a companion star ( through the search for doppler orbital modulation of the x - ray spin period , and through observations at other wavelengths ; @xcite ) , which might power their emission through the accretion mechanism , at least with a mass greater than 0.1m@xmath7 .",
    "an alternative source of energy is therefore required to power the x - ray emission of axps and sgrs .    assuming these sources being isolated x - ray pulsars with a dipole magnetic field configuration and purely magnetic dipole losses , their inferred magnetic fields are extremely high , b@xmath8  g : these magnetic fields have been identified as the possible additional energy reservoir . in fact ,",
    "if axps and sgrs are indeed `` magnetars '' , i. e. isolated highly magnetic neutron stars , many of their bizarre x - ray properties might be explained : the x - ray luminosity is naturally provided by the decay of these ultra - strong magnetic fields , while their peculiar short bursts may result from magnetic induced cracks on the neutron star surface ( @xcite ; 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the long lasting flux enhancements observed in some magnetars @xcite may be associated to single fractures on a larger spatial scale , or to the episodic onset of a wind energised by frequent , small scale fractures and/or quasi - steady seismic vibrations @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the magnetars magnetic fields are all above the so - called `` quantum critical field '' @xmath9  g , at which the radio pulsations are expected to be suppressed by processes such as photon splitting which may inhibit pair - production cascades @xcite responsible for creating the radio emission of the normal radio pulsars .",
    "however , the discovery of high magnetic field radio pulsars @xcite and transient radio pulsed emission from one axp @xcite put many uncertainties with this respect making again theoretically plausible a link between axps and radio pulsars .    in the past years , radio observations of axps and sgrs , performed using different antennas and arrays , have given always negative results ( e.g. @xcite ) both to timing and interferometry searches , but revealing in a few cases some reliable associations with snrs @xcite and in one case an interesting stellar wind bubble blown by the massive progenitor @xcite .",
    "however , in some peculiar circumstances radio counterparts were detected : a ) the sgrs giant flares , rare , catastrophic and highly energetic events , have been discovered powering a radio outburst , which slowly faded with a timescale of weeks @xcite , b ) during the outburst of the only confirmed transient axp , xte j1810 - 197 , the very large array ( vla ) observations ( with angular resolution of 6 \" ) revealed a point source of flux density @xmath10mjy at 1.4 ghz @xcite , which has recently been discovered as pulsated at the neutron star spin period @xcite .    with this picture in mind",
    "we have undertaken a systematic deep search for radio pulsations in three confirmed ( , , ) and one candidate axp ( ) , visible from the southern hemisphere using the parkes radio telescope .",
    "observations and data analysis are described in  [ sec : obs ] while in  [ sec : results ] we report on the obtained results , discussed in the context of the magnetar scenario in ",

    "the dashed line represents the limit for radio emission quenching .",
    "the four sources surrounded by a square emit in radio besides being above this line .",
    "the three confirmed axps of our sample for which a determination of @xmath11 is available are surrounded by a circle . ]",
    "in table [ tab1 ] the sample of observed axps is presented . for each object the name , period and period derivative of x - ray pulsations , the derived surface magnetic field ,",
    "the estimated distance d and the association with a snr or with a nebula are listed .    [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     none of the pulsed signals found during this blind search could arise from any of the axps that we observed , because of the discrepancy in position .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows , for four different values of the dm , the upper limits on the flux density at 1.4 ghz reached for the four pointed regions of the sky as a function of the spin period .",
    "these limits have been estimated using equation [ eq1 ] with @xmath12 and multiplying the limit obtained by a factor @xmath13 taking into account losses due to the search technique ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the @xmath14 threshold adopted here is higher with respect to the one used in the previous step of the analysis : this is because , given the huge amount of radio frequency interferences ( rfi ) with which we have to deal when doing a blind periodicity search ( especially at low s / n ) , we can not safely state as a good candidate a suspect with s / n less than , usually , 8 .",
    "the rfi problem is not so important when folding the time series at a specific value of the period , hence in that case we can be less conservative using a lower threshold for the candidate selection and , consequently , for the @xmath14 to adopt in the @xmath15 calculation .        in order to verify the reliability of the quoted flux density limits",
    ", we can compare the catalogued fluxes of the 18 redetected pulsars ( obtained from the atnf pulsar catalogue : ) with those estimated putting in equation [ eq1 ] their detection periods , dms and s / ns ( or mean s / n , for pulsars with multiple detections ) and considering the offset of the detection beam with respect to the true position of the pulsars .",
    "the ratio between the estimated and the catalogued values of the flux densities are shown , as a function of the rotational period , in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "note that the s / n used to estimate the flux density , may sensibly vary from one observation to another ( e.g. because of the different response of different beams in which the pulsar is detected , or because of rfi ) , leading to a large uncertainty in the estimate of the flux density .",
    "averaging the s / ns from different observations would lead to a better match between the estimated and catalogued fluxes .    ) and the catalogued value of the flux density of the 18 redetected pulsars . the errorbars are drawn assuming , besides the errors on the measured values , a 20% error on the estimated fluxes .",
    "the mean value of the ratio calculated over the 18 sources is @xmath16 ( 2-@xmath17 error ) . ]    finally no new rrat - like signal has been found in the single pulse search over the 52 observed regions , while two previously known pulsars ( j17053950 and j18440433 ) have been detected also through their single pulses .",
    "no radio pulsation has been found from the four southern axps observed , down to a limit of @xmath18 mjy ( table [ tab2 ] ) .    comparing the upper limits on the luminosity at 1400 mhz ( defined as @xmath19 ) for our targets with the luminosity of the observed radio pulsar population in the galactic field ( figure [ fig6 ] )",
    ", we note that the limits reached by our search are a factor of six lower than the median of the population .",
    "the values obtained for our sample are in fact in the range 2.8  3.8 mjy kpc@xmath20 ( shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) while the median of the distribution in luminosity of the observed radio pulsars in our galaxy is 18.0 mjy kpc@xmath20 .",
    "if the luminosity function of axps reflects that of observed canonical pulsars we can calculate that the probability for all our four targets to have luminosities below our limits is only @xmath21 .",
    "similar results are obtained comparing the upper limits on @xmath22 for our sample with the luminosity distribution of only young pulsars ( with characteristic ages @xmath23 yr ) or long period pulsars ( with p @xmath24 3 s ) .",
    "a comparison with the few high magnetic field radio pulsars ( having magnetic field strengths above the quantum critical field line ; figure [ fig1 ] ) is not statistically significant , having only four objects in this class .",
    "however we note that all their luminosities , as well as the radio luminosity of @xcite , are greater than the limits obtained for the axps .",
    "note however that , if we compare our results with the _ intrinsic _ luminosity distribution of the radio pulsars ( dashed line in figure [ fig6 ] ; @xcite ) , we obtain a probability of @xmath25% that our observations are not deep enough to detect a radio pulsed signal from our targets .    in considering the causes of the non detection of a radio pulsed signal from our four targets , besides the luminosity bias , we must take into account the possibility that , although the x - ray beam is pointing toward us , the radio beam , usually narrower , is not . assuming a pulse duty cycle of @xmath26 ( hence a beam semi - aperture @xmath27 ) , typical of long period pulsars and similar to that of the radio pulsed signal detected by @xcite in the transient axp ( @xmath28 at 1.4 ghz )",
    ", we can calculate , following e.g. @xcite , that the probability that such a narrow radio beam misses the earth is @xmath29 .",
    "the composite probability that the beams of all four axps are not pointing toward us is hence @xmath30 .",
    "the non detection of rrat - like bursts from any of these axps , despite our long exposures , seems to weaken the hypothesis that rrat bursts might be related to the short bursts observed from the magnetars leaving us with other plausible conjectures of a relation with other classes of neutron stars such as middle aged radio pulsars displaying giant pulses @xcite or with x - ray dim isolated neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the only case of a detection of radio pulsations from an axp concerns the only confirmed transient magnetar @xcite .",
    "radio emission from this source is strongly related with the occurrence of an outburst of its x - ray emission @xcite , as well as an ir enhancement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , whereas the x - ray flux is decaying exponentially with timescale of a few hundreds days @xcite , radio emission is still on more than 3 years after the x - ray outburst .",
    "interestingly the sole other possible transient axp is the candidate , one of our targets .",
    "our radio observations of this source were performed more than six years after its possible x - ray outburst occurred in 1993 , hence unfortunately nothing can be safely concluded from our upper limits , in favor or against the possible radio and x - ray correlation during the outbursts of this source .",
    "however , assuming that experienced , after the x - ray outburst , a phase of radio emission similar to that of , our null detection implies that the fading of the radio emission has a time scale of the order of few years : in particular , if at the onset of its putative radio emission phase had a similar luminosity as , this would imply a decrease in @xmath22 of a factor of @xmath31 over six years .",
