    "brane world scenarios envisage our universe as a hypersurface embedded in a higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "large extra dimensions will not be visible in collider experiments if standard model fields are confined to this hypersurface .",
    "however , one should not expect gravity to be confined in the same way .",
    "randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite are simple self - consistent scenarios in which gravity _ is _ effectively localized on a codimension one brane and the observed four - dimensional newtonian limit is reproduced .",
    "one also recovers standard friedman cosmology on the brane for energies low compared to the brane tension .",
    "the key is the non - factorizable , warped metric of the bulk .",
    "nevertheless , rs models have an undesirable and much discussed feature : the problem of fine - tuning . for the rs ii set - up which features one brane with positive tension @xmath0 and a bulk cosmological constant @xmath1 , we require @xmath2 this fine - tuning is also necessary in cosmological models to obtain the correct expansion behaviour of the observed universe @xcite",
    ". one of our goals here is to find ways to evade fine - tuning in brane world models and without needing a bulk cosmological constant .",
    "since brane world models ( mis)appropriate ideas from string / m - theory , it is usually hoped that they will arise as effective models in some string theory limit . from a phenomenological perspective therefore , one is led to include other fields , for example moduli fields , or to consider modifications to einstein - hilbert gravity .",
    "bulk scalar fields have been extensively considered because they can stabilize two - brane models and also give rise to cosmological solutions . because the gauss - bonnet term is nontrivial in five dimensions , the consequences of adding this term to the bulk action",
    "have also been explored .    here",
    "we combine ideas from both these extensions of the usual rs model . to be precise , we consider a gravitational lagrangian which is nonlinear in the ricci scalar : @xmath3 we call this the physical or higher - derivative ( hd ) frame . in general",
    ", such an action leads to equations of motion of fourth order and there is little hope to solve them .",
    "however , this action is conformally equivalent to einstein - hilbert gravity with a bulk scalar field . in this scalar field",
    "( sf ) frame , it is possible to obtain solutions to the equations of motion and to transform the results back to the physical frame .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : first , we establish the conformal equivalence of the hd and sf frames , and place brane worlds within this framework .",
    "we present the complete action including the appropriate gibbons - hawking boundary term for @xmath4-gravity . in section [ bsoln ] ,",
    "we construct brane world solutions in the sf frame for potentials derived from superpotentials and for simple quadratic potentials . finally , we perturb about these background solutions in order to show that gravity remains localized on the brane .",
    "our methodology draws heavily on our recent work on bulk scalar field solutions @xcite .",
    "we also include an appendix which details a calculation in the hd frame .",
    "higher - derivative gravity theories that depend only on the ricci scalar are conformally related to usual scalar - tensor theories of gravity@xcite . consider the conformal transformation of the metric in @xmath5 spacetime dimensions , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant of the full spacetime .",
    "the scalar field @xmath8 acts like a dilaton field . under this transformation , ( [ higherderivativeaction ] ) becomes the einstein - hilbert action plus the usual scalar field action : @xmath9 .\\ ] ] the potential @xmath10 contains the information about the original gravitational lagrangian .",
    "in fact it is related to the legendre transformation of @xmath4 .",

    "then @xmath36 , etc .",
    "actually , with a different rescaling , it is possible to absorb @xmath37 as well , but this will make any fine - tuning of the parameters less apparent . in particular , we do not want the potential to depend on the brane tension .    in the sf frame , where we perform all our calculations , the metric ansatz is @xmath38 with the brane considered fixed at @xmath39 . for simplicity , @xmath40-symmetry is assumed ; we will write down solutions only for @xmath41 .",
    "we consider perturbations about this background in the next section .",

    "superpotentials , familiar ingredients of supergravity theories , can be usefully employed for purely mathematical reasons @xcite .",
    "given a superpotential @xmath52 , the associated potential in five dimensions is @xmath53 ( smuggled into the definition of @xmath54 is an overall factor of @xmath55 , which we need to ensure @xmath56-symmetry across the brane , but this does not affect the calculation of @xmath57 . ) the advantage of such scalar field potentials is that the second order equations become first order and the constraint equation is immediately satisfied .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to avoid fine - tuning in this class of models .",
    "additionally , the transformation back to the hd frame leads to an @xmath4 that requires extra effort to make physical sensible .",

    "the use of a so - called regulator brane to ` slice off ' singularities in a solution is well recognized in brane world models with scalar fields . here",
    ", we are slicing off an offending piece of the theory space . in this picture , the two branes and the higher - derivative theory of gravity are inseparable ; this is phenomenologically in the spirit of string theory .",
    "the expression for @xmath4 in the invertible range is not very illuminating ; it is sketched in fig.([linearf ] ) for @xmath71 .",

    "<S> we solve for a gravity model that has corrections quadratic in the ricci scalar and show one can evade both fine - tuning and the need for a bulk cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of tensor and scalar perturbations shows gravity is localized on the brane and we recover the newtonian limit .    </S>",
