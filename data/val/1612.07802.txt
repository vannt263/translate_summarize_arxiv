    "relativity theory  @xcite provides a remarkable example of the construction of a nontrivial time scale on the basis of a symmetry principle ; namely , the proper time of a moving body from the requirement of invariance of the laws of nature for different observers .",
    "this example , in which symmetry lays at the very foundation of the physical theory , may suggest to look for other contexts in which symmetries could help in defining useful notions of time .",
    "non - stationary time series are very frequently encountered in fields like meteorology  @xcite , seismology  @xcite , physiology  @xcite , economy and finance  @xcite .",
    "the non - stationary mark , limits the applicability of statistical methods in the quest for the process characterizing the series , and may hinder a correct detection of the possible power - law scalings of the signals and of the associated long - range correlations  @xcite .",
    "depending on the quality of the stochastic process , different strategies can be applied to simplify the signals and to recover stationarity properties  @xcite .",
    "for instance , various detrending procedures have been proposed  @xcite , although in the general case their success is not always guaranteed  @xcite .",
    "other approaches  @xcite are instead based on a reassessment of the time stamp in terms of which the series is recorded . in particular , in the case of seismology it has been recently advanced  @xcite that the distribution of intercurrence times between earthquakes becomes scale - invariant under a proper redefinition of time ; the latter renders intercurrencies stationary on the basis of the omori s aftershock law  @xcite .",
    "following inspiration provided by the example of relativity , within the context of time series affected by cyclic non - stationary behavior  @xcite we show here that one can promote the fulfillment of a scaling symmetry to become an operative criterion for the definition of a novel time .",
    "as one should expect , the symmetry enforcement leads to a distinct simplification of the analysis .",
    "our focus is on finance , a field in which the very definition of time constitutes a long - standing problem , while the application of symmetry principles lacks a strong tradition .",
    "a clock properly adjusted to financial activity is not easy to identify .",
    "financial markets have to cope with human daily routines throughout the world and bursts and doldrums occur at various time scales . in addition , during nights , weekends , and festivities , transactions stop in most cases . these interruptions ,",
    "at the end of which assets prices turn out to have changed anyhow , together with the recurrent patterns in the activity ( seasonalities ) , immediately signal the inadequacy of `` natural '' physical time as the appropriate one in terms of which to describe the stochastic evolution of financial markets . besides physical time",
    ", different alternatives have been studied  @xcite , including trading time , volume time , and tick - by - tick time .",
    "a time definition ( theta - time ) has also been put forward with the specific intent of getting rid of the seasonalities in financial time series  @xcite .",
    "theta - time is designed to record the progress of market activity through the increase of the volatility as measured by the average absolute return .",
    "for the latter a power - law behavior is assumed as a function of physical time , but no further attempt to discuss and possibly simplify the scaling properties of the return probability density function ( pdf ) is made . in many of the referred proposals , inactive periods are cut from the elapsing time  @xcite , and the duration to be ascribed to overnight and similar returns remains an open question .",
    "in general , there is also little focus on the requirement that increments over intervals of equal span should be identically distributed in order to make sliding - window sampling applicable for the construction of their empirical pdfs .",
    "here we show that a solution to these problems is naturally suggested by the existence of an approximate symmetry which appears when the pdfs increments over different intervals are compared .",
    "indeed , from days to several weeks , the empirical financial returns pdfs are found to be approximately scale - invariant , in a sense familiar from the physics of critical phenomena  @xcite . defining financial returns @xmath0 over the time span @xmath1 (",
    "here @xmath1 is an integer number of days ) as the log - difference of the asset price value @xmath2 , @xmath3 , this means that the empirical pdfs of @xmath0 over different @xmath1 s can be collapsed onto each other in force of the scaling law @xmath4 where @xmath5 is called the hurst exponent  @xcite , and @xmath6 , which is not gaussian , is a scaling function .",
    "it turns out that @xmath5 is close to @xmath7 for assets of developed markets  @xcite . the symmetry property expressed by eq",
    ".   has been recently assumed as a modeling basis for the stochastic dynamics of financial indexes  @xcite . combining scaling with ideas of fine graining inspired by the renormalization group approach of statistical mechanics  @xcite ,",
    "these models reproduce many stylized facts exposed by interday time series analysis .",
    "most important here , the strict validity of eq .   would establish an univoque correspondence between returns pdfs and time intervals durations @xmath1 s .",
    "however , eq .   definitely does not hold at the intraday time scales , where non - stationarities affect pdfs for returns defined over intervals with equal physical time duration  @xcite , and @xmath5 can be very different from @xmath7 in selected time windows  @xcite . even in the interday domain multiscaling effects  @xcite and a slow crossover to gaussianity  @xcite",
    "prevent a full realization of the collapses implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) .    in view of the difficulties involved in the definition of time in finance , specifying the returns pdfs in terms of a single",
    ", appropriate parameter remains a basic goal worth pursuing . here",
    "we show that if defined with respect to a suitable function of physical time  which we call financial scaling time ( fst ) ",
    "returns pdfs become identical for intervals of the same fst duration .",
    "moreover , when rescaled through an hurst exponent equal to @xmath7 , satisfactory collapses for pdfs related to different fst spans are exhibited .",
    "our results hold within a window ranging from few minutes to several days in physical time , hence bridging the intraday and interday regimes .",
    "our basic ansatz is that , once expressed in terms of fst , eq .",
    "turns into an exact scaling law with @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the fst duration of an interval and @xmath6 is a suitable scaling function .",
    "the fst construction exploits the fact that , in spite of the manifest non - stationarities at the intraday level  @xcite , the process of return aggregation appears compatible with the assumption of one - day ciclostationarity  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of the aggregate return from the opening during each market day can be regarded as a realization of the same stochastic process  @xcite , and empirical averages can be taken over correspondent time windows within different days .",
    "the fst construction proceeds as follows : on the physical time axis we first operate a partition into intervals consistent with the one - day periodicity of the process of return formation .",
    "intervals are arbitrary , except for the fact that their extrema should not fall within the periods of market closure , and that their duration should be above a lower cutoff ( typically of the order of a few minutes , as we discuss below ) .",
    "it is convenient , but not necessary , to set the morning opening of the market as the lower extremum of the first partition interval , and to let the last interval of each day coincide with the full overnight ( or weekend ) closure . in the example",
    "treated below , we further choose to assign the same physical time span to all remaining intraday intervals .",
    "intervals exceeding the duration of one day are then constructed as the union of a suitable number of intraday intervals pertaining to different days .",
    "our purpose is to associate an appropriate fst - duration to each interval with extrema belonging to the partition .",
    "of course , if we call @xmath11 and @xmath12 the fst durations of any two contiguous intervals , we require the span @xmath13 of their union to satisfy the measure property @xmath14 this allows us to consistently map the physical - time partition onto the @xmath15-axis .",
    "so , a @xmath16-axis partition possesses a @xmath15-axis partition image , and vice versa .",
    "eq .   together with eq",
    ".   immediately impose an important constraint .",
    "calling @xmath17 and @xmath18 the returns over the contiguous intervals of duration @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , we necessarily have @xmath19=(\\delta\\tau_1+\\delta\\tau_2)\\int\\mathrm{d}x\\,g(x)\\,x^2 $ ] ; whence @xmath20=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes ciclostationary averages in the sense specified above .",
    "this linear uncorrelation , which does not imply independence  @xcite , corresponds to the martingale property for the stochastic process defining the price formation  @xcite and is generally valid if the market is efficient and the interval durations are above a few minutes ( in physical time )  @xcite .",
    "this is the origin of the lower cutoff to be assumed in the duration of the partition intervals .",
    "for convenience , we take as a reference sample the empirical pdf of a full day ( opening - to - opening ) return , and associate to this time interval the unit of fst : @xmath22 . to assess and quantify the validity of eq .",
    ", we extensively apply the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) two - sample test  @xcite : the scaling factor @xmath23 guaranteeing through eq .   the best possible data - collapse with respect to the reference sample pdf , identifies the duration in @xmath24 units for the chosen returns interval . in the methods",
    "section we describe in detail the implementation of the above ideas to the s&p500 index , recorded at 1-minute frequency between 9:40 and 16:00 from september 1985 to june 2013 . for this specific dataset ( including entries of thirty years ago ) a duration @xmath25 over",
    "which contiguous returns can be considered linearly uncorrelated corresponds to 20-minutes ( see methods for details ) . due to the impact of information technology on trading practice ,",
    "the more recent the data are considered , the lower can be put this threshold  @xcite .    a partition of the physical - time axis is conveniently identified as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 labels the day after the one whose opening has been chosen as the origin ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 singles out the time instant within day @xmath27 ( ) . in view of the previous discussion , we require @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 to correspond to the daily opening and closure times , respectively .",

    "if , reversely , one plots equally - spaced contiguous @xmath23-intervals as a function of the physical time ( fig .",

    "volatility is a central quantity in financial practice , assessing the intensity of market fluctuations .",
    "it may be defined as  in fst : .",
    "clear evidence of the non - stationarity of returns in the physical time scale is given by the characteristic `` u '' shape assumed by the intraday volatility defined over the day - by - day ensemble of returns  @xcite ( see fig .

    "[ fig_timecomparison]b ) .",
    "the availability of a time series with stationary increments , eliminating thus the seasonalities appearing in the physical time scale , conveys the methodological advantage that empirical analyses can be performed through ordinary , sliding - window techniques , hence extending considerably the sample size for statistical confidence .",

    "is that a log - log plot of the @xmath49th - moment @xmath50 $ ] vs. @xmath13 should be a straight line with slope @xmath51 .",
    "the empirical analysis of the returns moment as a function of the time interval duration is particularly revealing about the meaning of the fst .",
    "[ fig_scaling ] highlights that the recurrent patterns deviating from straight behavior in physical time ( fig .",

    "[ fig_multiscaling]b ) .",
    "this evidence poses an interesting general question in time series analysis , about the existence of proper time definitions capable to re - absorb to a substantial extent detected multiscaling behaviors .",
    "so far , results concern single - point statistics . in finance ,",
    "a fundamental two - point indicator is the volatility autocorrelation function  @xcite , i.e. the correlation between absolute values of two returns at a given lag . at variance with the linear one",
    ", the volatility autocorrelation is known to decay very slowly with the time lag  @xcite . in fig .",

    "the autocorrelation has been evaluated through a sliding - window procedure .",
    "the ciclostationary quality of @xmath54 in physical time is a direct consequence of the `` u '' shape in fig .",
    "[ fig_timecomparison]a .",
    "in contrast , in fst - lag the periodic structure of @xmath55 is almost completely removed , pointing out the methodological advantage in such an empirical estimation .",
    "we have shown that the assumption of : ( i ) simple - scaling invariance with hurst exponent @xmath7 for the return pdf , eq .  ; ( ii ) validity of the measure property , eq . ; unambiguously lead to the definition of a time scale for martingale processes in finance , which renders stationary the pdfs of returns over identical spans .",
    "the construction of fst is based on the minimization of the ks distance of the pdf for the returns at a given scale , with respect to a reference one .",
    "it covers a wide range of physical time scales and opens interesting perspectives in the statistical analysis of financial time series .",
    "for instance , the attained increments stationarity may sensibly enrich empirical estimates enlarging dataset analyses from ciclostationary to sliding - window procedures .",
    "moreover , we have solved the problem of including overnight and over - weekend returns in financial analysis , bridging intra and interday regimes .",
    "this makes markets with discontinuous trading activity closer to those not experiencing transaction interruptions  @xcite , opening thus possibilities for meaningful comparisons .",
    "methodological approaches based on symmetries are not frequently discussed in finance . however , some of the ingredients we employed have interesting precursors in the history of financial markets analysis .",
    "indeed , stimulated by the discovery of fat tails  @xcite , previous studies  @xcite attempted at modifying the returns pdfs through the introduction of a stochastic redefinition of time , in order to cast them into gaussians . here , no reference to probability models is made and our fst is not stochastic , but like in these earlier studies our time redefinition is intended to alter some fundamental property of the returns pdfs : in our case , it enforces their scaling symmetry .",
    "more recently , financial theta - time has been introduced on the basis of the power - law behavior of absolute returns  @xcite .",
    "however , no attempt has been made to reconcile the alternative time - definition with a simple - scaling invariance of the return pdfs .",
    "while the distribution of geometric brownian motion of the standard model of finance , or the levy - stable distribution first suggested by mandelbrot as an alternative  @xcite , are invariant under time rescaling , more recent work on financial modeling has focused on multiscaling aspects and their evocative analogies with turbulence  @xcite . as a matter of fact , multiscaling features in analyses performed with respect to physical time are nowadays regarded as a stylized fact  @xcite .",
    "our findings here allude to an alternative : once returns are analyzed on the fst - axis a simple - scaling picture may be restored .",
    "it should also be remarked that our construction does not conflict with the possible presence of other stylized facts related to the breaking of time reversal invariance , like the leverage effect  @xcite whereby a negative price change is on average followed by a volatility increase .",
    "indeed , the fst scale - invariant distribution could , e.g. , present skewness .",
    "time scales capable to conform complex behavior with relatively simple properties shared by ordinary stochastic processes should also be relevant in the study of collective assets dynamics , where time - related issues like e.g. the epps effect  @xcite or the lead - lag  @xcite question are a main focus of the current research .",
    "we believe that strategies similar to the one adopted here could be used in even broader contexts , in cases in which time series display recurrent patterns and scaling properties are at least approximately obeyed .",
    "one relevant candidate could be represented by the records of recurrence times in seismicity  @xcite .",
    "our fst construction is illustrated considering the s&p500 index recorded in one minute intervals between 9:40 am and 16:00 pm new york time and from 30 september 1985 to 28 june 2013 .",
    "after excluding those days for which the records are not complete ( e.g. holidays and market anticipated closures or delayed openings ) , the data - set includes @xmath57 trading days . for each single day",
    "@xmath27 ( @xmath58 ) there is a total of @xmath59 index values @xmath60",
    "( @xmath61 , with @xmath62 ) . in order to work with zero empirical averages ,",

    "overnights include single night returns , returns over weekends , returns over holidays and other market closures .",
    "closures due to specific market reasons should be in principle treated differently from weekends and normal holidays ( e.g. , several days following the black monday 1987 are missing in the dataset because of anticipated market close ) . since we verified that they introduce only minor effects",
    "( see also below ) , in our analysis we do not make such distinctions .    in the construction of @xmath68",
    "a key step consists in checking whether two random variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 are identically distributed . a basic tool to establish this is the ks two - sample test  @xcite .",
    "given two samples @xmath71 , @xmath72 , with empirical cumulative distribution functions @xmath73 , @xmath74 , respectively , the test is based on the rescaled supremum of the distributions difference : @xmath75 in those cases in which the samples refer to independent variables , the test can rely on the ks theorem to assign a significance level to any @xmath76 , under the null hypothesis that @xmath77 , @xmath78 come from the same distribution .",
    "if however samples are extracted from the same time series and data display long - range dependence like in the case examined in the present study , the mapping between @xmath76 and the associated significance level is expected to be strongly affected  @xcite , and only model - dependent statements can be produced .",
