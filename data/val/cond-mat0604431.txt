    "novel superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) , such as charge ( i.e. , cooper - pair box),@xcite flux,@xcite and phase qubits,@xcite are good candidates for quantum information processing because these can be manufactured , controlled , and scaled more easily .",
    "tens of quantum oscillations had been observed in these qubits , but a low level of decay which yields thousands of coherence oscillations is essential for realization of quantum computation .",
    "the longest coherence time of 0.5 @xmath3s has been reported for the quantronium@xcite ( i.e. , hybrid charge - flux qubit ) , but longer time may still be necessary .",
    "as many decoherence sources reduce the quantum oscillations , the measured value of the coherence time for the superconducting qubits is substantially shorter@xcite than that predicted by the simplest models of decoherence and that needed for the operation of a quantum computer .",
    "this requirement of obtaining ultra - long coherence time in the presence of the interaction between the qubit system and noisy environment is one of major challenges .    understanding the mechanisms of decoherence became a focus of much attention recently , and it remains an important challenge for the superconducting qubits .",
    "an ideal solution is to isolate the qubit system from uncontrolled degree of freedom in its environment and in the device itself .",
    "however , it is difficult to isolate the qubit system completely from the decoherence sources .",
    "these sources include , but may not be limited to , background charge fluctuations in the substrate,@xcite fluctuations in the tunnel barrier which produce microscopic tunneling resonance,@xcite and fluctuating electromagnetic background . also , low frequency variation in the critical current@xcite is present in all superconducting qubits .",
    "one way to obtain the ultra - long coherence time is to use the josephson vortex qubit ( jvq ) since it msy be immune to these sources .",
    "recently , jvq has been proposed as a new superconducting qubit.@xcite this qubit has two important advantages over other superconducting qubits .",
    "first , coupling between the qubit system and the decoherence sources is weak at very low temperatures .",
    "for example , a josephson vortex ( i.e. , fluxon ) in a uniform long josephson junction ( ljj ) does not generate any radiation during its motion and is almost decoupled from other electromagnetic excitations in the junction .",
    "also the qubit is immune to fluctuations in the critical current .",
    "consequently , quantum coherence can be maintained much longer than other qubits which are susceptible to these decoherence sources .",
    "second , as the fluxon dynamics in ljj is described by using the perturbed sine - gordon equation,@xcite the decoherence sources for the qubit may be easily identified .",
    "for example , two important sources are the quasiparticle dissipation and weak current noise . hence , the coherence time may be estimated more easily , but the effect of these sources has not yet been estimated for the jvq .    ) and insulator ( @xmath4 ) . @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the dimensions in @xmath7 and @xmath8direction , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the time dependent bias current density .",
    "the filled dashed circles represent the microresistors which behave as pinning centers for fluxon.,width=245 ]    the jvq exploits the property of fluxon,@xcite which behaves as a quantum particle at ultra - low temperatures .",
    "the fluxon trapped in a controllable potential well in a single annular ljj shows ( i ) energy quantization in the potential well and ( ii ) macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) from a metastable state.@xcite also , it was shown that the two quantum states for the qubit can be created by using a heart - shaped@xcite annular ljj and by trapping a fluxon in a magnetic field - controlled double - well potential .",
    "these quantum states may also be created using a linear ljj with two closely implanted defect sites in the insulator layer.@xcite a nb - alo@xmath10-nb junction may be used to fabricate the jvq , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "the dimensions of the junction , compared to the josephson length @xmath11 , are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the separation distance @xmath14 between the defect sites must be larger than the critical distance @xmath15 , as discussed below .",
    "also , the preparation of initial state and the read - out of the final qubit state may be performed by using classical circuits.@xcite    as the effect of the decoherence sources in the ljj is described by using the perturbed sine - gordon equation , the coherence time @xmath2 , @xmath16 for the jvq may be estimated without making further assumptions about the nature of the qubit - environment interaction .",
    "here @xmath0 is the relaxation time , and @xmath1 is the dephasing time . since @xmath1 is most sensitive to the decoherence sources , extending @xmath1 for the superconducting qubits",
    "is important for quantum computing applications .",
    "we compute @xmath2 by accounting for the two sources : ( i ) quasiparticle dissipation and ( ii ) weak current noise .",
    "it is noted that the jvq may also couple to other sources , such as microwave and phonon radiation , but the effect of these sources is expected to be small as they lead to higher order@xcite contribution in the perturbation expansion than that considered in the present paper . in the jvq , the weak current noise represents the low frequency magnetic field and current fluctuations in the junction .",
    "we focus on slow fluctuations since the qubits suffer from the presence of strong low frequency noise sources .",
    "the effects of these two decoherence sources have been investigated also for other superconducting qubits@xcite and were found to be important .    in this paper ,",
    "_ we show that the jvq can yield ultra - long coherence time because it couples very weakly to noisy environment at low temperatures . _ before proceeding further , we outline the main results .",
    "i ) starting from the perturbed sine - gordon equation , we show that _ the critical current fluctuation does not couple to the jvq within the lowest order approximation .",
    "consequently , this fluctuation effect does not lead to decoherence of the qubit . _",
    "ii ) we show that _ @xmath2 at ultra - low temperatures is determined by the low frequency current noise since the dissipation effect due to qubit - environment coupling is exponentially small . _",
    "iii ) using experimentally obtained physical parameters , we show that _ the effect of this current noise on decoherence is weak in the jvq .",
    "_ this weak coupling between the jvq and current noise leads to _ the coherence time of several tens of microseconds for the jvq . _    we outline the remainder of the paper . in sec .",

    "iii , we obtain the two - state system , described by the spin - boson model with low frequency current noise . here , the quasiparticle dissipation is described by using ohmic environment , and the effects of low frequency noise in ljj is described by using the fluctuating weak bias current . in sec .",

    "vi , we summarize the result and conclude .",
    "in this section , we discuss how the ljj may be used to obtain a jvq by starting from the perturbed sine - gordon equation .",
    "first , a double - well potential for the fluxon needs to be created in the ljj to obtain the two quantum states of the jvq .",

    "we estimated @xmath187 by accounting for the fact that the current noise may arise from the magnetic field fluctuations in the junction .",

    "our estimated value of @xmath187 for the jvq , which is obtained by using the experimental data from the nb - alo@xmath10-nb ffo , is in the microsecond range because the spectral density for fluctuating magnetic field is very low .",
    "the value for @xmath1 is few orders of magnitude larger than that measured for the quantronium , suggesting that the jvq may also be a good candidate for quantum computer .",
    "this surprisingly long coherence time for the jvq is due to the fact that the fluxon , which behaves as a topologically stable quantum particle at ultra - low temperature , couples very weakly to both internal and external noise sources .",
    "the current estimate for @xmath2 may be extended further if the magnetic field fluctuations , which are considered as the dominant decoherence source in ljj , can be further reduced .",
