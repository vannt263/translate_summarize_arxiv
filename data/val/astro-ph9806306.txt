    "the observations of gravitational microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have revealed that a significant fraction of the milky way s halo consists of solar or sub - solar - mass compact objects , which are called massive compact halo objects ( hereafter machos ; alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , 1996 , 1997 , aubourg _ et al .",
    "so far at least six microlensing events have been detected toward the lmc , and recent analyses have shown that the macho mass is about @xmath3 ( alcock _ et al .",
    "the fractional contribution of the machos to the galactic halo mass is also estimated to be @xmath4(alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , but may vary between 15 and 100% ( e.g. , kan - ya , nishi & nakamura 1996 ) .    the mass estimate of @xmath5 is consistent with red dwarf stars and old white dwarfs as baryonic candidates for machos , but both halos have serious difficulties .",
    "a red dwarf halo can not be consistent with the observations since red dwarfs do not appear in the star counts of galactic halo fields ( graff & freese 1996 ) . if machos are old white dwarfs , the initial mass function ( imf ) of the progenitor stars must be strongly peaked around @xmath6 ( adams & laughlin 1997 , chabrier , segretain & mra 1996 ) , being completely different from the present day imf ( e.g. scalo 1986 ) .",
    "moreover , the halos of distant galaxies must be brightened by progenitor stars of the present day macho white dwarfs , which contradicts with the number count of distant galaxies ( charlot & silk 1995 ) .",
    "the overproduction of helium , carbon and nitrogen is also a major problem for a white dwarf halo ( charlot & silk 1995 ; gibson & mould 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the age of the white dwarfs which are cool and faint enough to be consistent with the negative result of hdf star count ( flynn , gould & bahcall 1996 ) is very old ( chabrier , segretain & mra 1996 ) .",
    "the age estimated by chabrier _",
    "( 1996 ) is not consistent with recent observations of the hubble constant .",
    "on the other hand , brown dwarfs are possible and attractive candidates for machos , since it is free from problems concerning metals and star counts .",
    "the largest problem of a brown dwarf halo is the consistency with the mass estimate of @xmath7 .",
    "the mass estimate is , however , based on the  standard halo model , in which the rotation curve is flat out to the lmc .",
    "hence , if the standard halo model does not represent the galactic halo well , the macho mass would be changed considerably .",
    "recently , honma & sofue ( 1996 ; 1997a ) revealed that the outer rotation curve of the galaxy could be declining if the galactic constant @xmath8 , which is the rotation velocity of the galaxy at the solar circle , is 200 km s@xmath1 or less , and several studies indeed suggested @xmath9 of @xmath10 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. , kuijken & tremaine 1994 ; olling & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , many observations have revealed declining rotation curves in the outer region of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; olling 1996 ; bland - hawthorn et al 1997 ; see also honma & sofue 1997b and references therein ) , indicating that declining rotation curves are not uncommon .    for these reasons ,",
    "it is important to re - analyze the macho mass with ",
    "non - standard halo models for which the outer rotation curve decline . in this letter we study the macho mass and the halo macho fraction based on such halo models and investigate the possibility of a brown dwarf halo .",
    "since this investigation is motivated by declining rotation curves , we focus on the halo models whose density profiles decrease faster than the standard halo model , @xmath11 , of which hernquist model and plummer model are common examples .",
    "the density of hernquist models is proportional to @xmath12 at large radii , and it is known to trace the luminosity profile of elliptical galaxies moderately well .",
    "the density of plummer models decreases faster than hernquist model at large radii , proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "the plummer model is known to trace the light distribution of globular clusters to some degree .",
    "conveniently enough , the potential - density pairs and the distribution functions are obtained analytically for both models .",
    "below we summarize the analytic form of the potential - density pairs and distribution functions .",
    "the relative potential and the density for hernquist model ( hernquist 1990 ) are written as , @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , @xmath17 is the total mass of the halo , and @xmath18 is the scale length .",
    "hernquist ( 1990 ) obtained the distribution function for this model as @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that the relative energy @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "the potential - density pair for the plummer model ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) are @xmath24 and @xmath25 the distribution function for this model is written as @xmath26    note that both of hernquist and plummer models contain only two parameters , the total mass @xmath17 and the scale length @xmath18 .",
    "based on the models described above , we calculate the optical depth @xmath27 and the macho mass @xmath28 .",
    "paczynski ( 1986 ) defined the optical depth as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the einstein ring radius , @xmath28 is the macho mass , and @xmath31 is the distance along the line of sight .",
    "we assume that the distance to the lmc is 50 kpc , and also that all machos have a unique mass @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath27 is related to the halo macho fraction , but independent of the macho mass because @xmath28 cancels out in eq.(7 ) .",
    "a quantity related to @xmath28 is the differential event rate @xmath32 ( griest 1991 ; see also alcock _ et al._1996 ) , which may be written as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the maximum impact parameter , @xmath35 is the einstein ring crossing time , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the radial and tangential velocities of machos , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath38 following alcock _",
    "et al._(1997 ) .",
    "the total event rate @xmath39 can be obtained by integrating eq.(8 ) with respect to @xmath40 , namely , @xmath41 .",
    "the expectation of @xmath40 can be obtained as @xmath42 note that @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 ( griest 1991 ) , and hence , the macho mass can be estimated by comparing @xmath43 with the observed one , @xmath45 . to be conservative ,",
    "we adopted @xmath46 and @xmath45 of 80 days from six events so far detected ( alcock _ et al .",
    "note that this @xmath45 is the simple arithmetic mean of the blending - corrected timescales for the six events , and the observational efficiency is not included here ( see next section for more elaborate analyses ) .",
    "figures 1 show the contours for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for hernquist models and plummer models in the parameter space of @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "the distance to the galactic center @xmath47 is assumed to be 7.5 kpc .",
    "if the iau standard @xmath47 of 8.5 kpc is assumed , the optical depth becomes slightly smaller , but the results are not significantly changed .",
    "figures 1 demonstrate that the macho mass can be @xmath48 or less depending on the halo parameters . in particular , the region for @xmath49 and the region for @xmath50 overlap ( shadowed region in figures 1 ) .",
    "this fact implies that the macho mass can be less than @xmath48 while keeping the halo macho fraction close to @xmath51% .",
    "therefore , a halo which consists solely of brown dwarfs ( @xmath52 ) is possible as long as these  non - standard halo models are accepted .",
    "figure 2 shows the rotation curves modeled with the non - standard halos plus a disk and a bulge .",
    "an infinitely - thin exponential disk is assumed for the disk component , and plummer model is assumed for the bulge .",
    "the scale lengths are fixed to be 3 kpc for the disk , and 0.4 kpc for the bulge , respectively .",
    "the two rotation curves in figure 2 ( full lines ) correspond to the galaxy s models with hernquist and plummer halo . for the galaxy s model with hernquist halo",
    ", we set @xmath53 and @xmath54 kpc for the halo , and the disk mass of @xmath55 and the bulge mass of @xmath56 ( hereafter model h ) .",
    "for the galaxy s model with plummer halo , we set @xmath57 and @xmath58 kpc for the halo , and the disk mass of @xmath59 and the bulge mass of @xmath60 ( hereafter model p ) .",
    "the halo parameters for models h and p lie in the shadowed region in figure 1 .    in figure 2 the observed rotation curve taken from honma & sofue ( 1997a )",
    "is also plotted ( @xmath61 km s@xmath1 assumed ) .",
    "the model rotation curves in figure 2 reproduce well the general tendency of observed rotation curves , except for a local deviation in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "the local density of the exponential disks assumed here are 51 and 58 @xmath2 pc@xmath62 , being in agreement with the studies on the local disk density ( kuijken & gilmore 1989 ; bahcall , flynn & gould 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , non - standard halo models which allow 100 % brown dwarf halos does not conflict with the constraints from the rotation curve or the local disk density . this conclusion is not affected by small changes in the halo parameters .",
    "why does the macho mass become so small when the non - standard halos are considered ?",
    "the substellar macho mass is obtained mainly because of the small velocity dispersion in the non - standard halos .",
    "the timescale @xmath40 , which is the only observable used for the mass determination , is given by @xmath63 .",
    "the einstein ring diameter is proportional to @xmath44 , and hence , @xmath64 if the timescale is given observationally .",
    "consequently , the macho mass becomes small if the velocity dispersion in the halo is sufficiently reduced .",
    "in fact , the tangential dispersion in the model p halo is 82 km s@xmath1 at @xmath65 kpc , which is less than half of the tangential dispersion for the standard halo , @xmath0 km s@xmath1 .",
    "in this section we perform the maximum likelihood analysis and investigate more precisely the possible range of the macho mass and the halo macho fraction .",
    "the method applied here is basically the same as alcock _",
    "et al._(1997 ) , whereas the halo models are the non - standard models described in section 2 .",
    "the likelihood of finding a set of @xmath66 detected events with duration times @xmath67 , is written as . without this factor",
    ", @xmath68 does not follow the poisson distribution correctly . ]",
    "@xmath69    \\prod^{n_{\\rm obs}}_{i=1}\\left[f e\\varepsilon(\\hat{t}_{i } )      \\frac{\\displaystyle d\\gamma}{\\displaystyle d\\hat{t}}(\\hat{t}_{i};m )    \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : likelihood}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the number of events expected from poisson statistics ( see eq.[8 ] in alcock _",
    "1997 ) , @xmath71 is the halo macho fraction , @xmath72 star - yr is the total exposure and @xmath73 is the observational efficiency .",
    "for the observational efficiency we use the photometric efficiency of the macho year-1 + 2 observation given in figure 8 of alcock _ et al . _",
    "the likelihood contours for model h are shown in figure 3a , and those for model p in figure 3b .",
    "the estimated macho mass @xmath28 is @xmath74 for model h , and @xmath75 for model p ( the errors denote 68% confidence level ) .",
    "most likely masses for both models are consistent with brown dwarfs .",
    "for the halo macho fraction @xmath71 , the elongated contours in figure 3 make the possible range of @xmath71 wide , but most likely values are fairly close to unity ( 0.92 for model h , and 0.86 for model p ) . the results for @xmath71 as well as the macho mass @xmath28 indicate that these halos can solely consist of brown dwarfs , confirming what we have found in the previous section .",
    "we have seen that a brown dwarf halo is a possible candidate for the galactic halo when the non - standard halo models are considered . assuming the halo macho fraction of unity for the models h and p , we obtain the macho mass within 50 kpc of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "these masses are somewhat lower than the estimate of @xmath78 by alcock _",
    "et al._(1997 ) , but do not contradict with each other when one considers the fact that the smaller @xmath47 adopted here tends to make @xmath27 higher for a given halo model . since the total masses of model h and p galaxies are @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81%@xmath82% of the total mass may be in the form of brown dwarfs .",
    "to be consistent with the star counts at high galactic latitude ( e.g. , bahcall _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , such a brown dwarf halo should have a steep imf at the low mass end ( e.g. , kan - ya _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; graff & freese 1996 ) . unfortunately",
    ", any physical process for producing such a steep imf is not known yet .",
    "however , the star formation from primordial gas may be very different from the present star formation because of the different cooling processes ( e.g. palla _ et al .",
    "_ 1983 , uehara _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , and hence such an imf may be possible if the halo brown dwarfs are different populations from disk stars .    in order to test the possibility of a brown dwarf halo , direct observations of the halo brown dwarfs are definitely important .",
    "unfortunately , star counts at high galactic latitude so far made were not deep enough to detect the halo brown dwarfs .",
    "for instance , the star counts with hst ( bahcall _ et al._1994 ) , which covers a sky area of 4.4 square arcmin with the limiting i - band magnitude of @xmath83 mag , detected no brown dwarf candidates . if the i - band absolute luminosity of @xmath84 brown dwarfs is 18 mag ( e.g. , delfosse _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , there should be @xmath85 brown dwarfs brighter than 25 mag in the vicinity of the sun ( model h assumed ) .",
    "the expected number in the hst filed of 4.4 square arcmin is , therefore , only 0.3 , being consistent with the negative detection . for direct detection of the halo brown dwarfs , a deeper survey with a larger area is required .",
    "10m - class telescopes with wide field of view , such as the subaru telescope with sprime - cam , will be useful for this kind of observation .",
    "we are grateful to y. sofue , j. jugaku , k. ohnishi , s. inutsuka and y. itoh for fruitful discussions .",
    "we also thank the referee for helpful suggestions in improving the manuscript .",
