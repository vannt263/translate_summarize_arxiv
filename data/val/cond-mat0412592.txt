    "spin - polarized electron tunneling is essential to spin - based electronics  @xcite and nanoscale magnetics based on the spin - transfer effect .",
    "@xcite whereas tunneling through a single tunnel barrier , either between two ferromagnets or between a ferromagnet and a normal metal , has been studied since the mid 1970s ,  @xcite the study of spin - polarized transport through mesoscopic double tunneling junctions is more recent .",
    "double mesoscopic junctions are of interest because of the small capacitance of the central region in between the tunneling junctions , which allows electrons to be transported one by one .",
    "@xcite experiments have been reported both for normal metal leads with a ferromagnetic island between the junctions  @xcite and for a normal island with spin - polarized junctions .",
    "@xcite a large number of theoretical works has dealt with these cases .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we consider the case of a normal metal island with ferromagnetic leads .",
    "if the temperature is much larger than the tunneling rates onto or off the island , electron tunneling is sequential . in that case ,",
    "quantum mechanical correlations between electrons in different states are lost because of thermal smearing , and a simple description in terms of rate equations applies . depending on whether the temperature is small or large compared to the level spacing in the island",
    ", these rate equations describe the probability to find a certain number of electrons on the island  @xcite or the occupation of the electronic states in the island .",
    "@xcite    whereas the rate - equation approach was applied straightforwardly to ferromagnetic leads with collinear polarizations ,  @xcite application to leads with non - collinear polarizations requires a formulation in terms of the density matrices of degenerate levels , not the occupations of states .",
    "@xcite ( if spin degeneracy on the normal metal island is lifted , e.g. , by a magnetic field , scalar rate equations remain valid despite polarized leads . )",
    "there are two reasons for this additional complication : first , with non - collinear polarizations , no common quantization direction exists , and one can not avoid a formulation of the problem in which electrons tunnel into superpositions of states with different spin projections .",
    "@xcite second , coupling to the ferromagnetic leads slightly lifts the spin degeneracy and leads to a slow precession of the spin on the dot .",
    "@xcite the use of density matrices instead of occupation probabilities in the rate equation formalism allows for the inclusion of correlations between different quantum states .",
    "@xcite since the temperature is much larger than the escape rate to the leads , only correlations between states with the same energy need to be taken into account .",
    "density - matrix rate equations were first used to describe transport through a metal particle ( or a quantum dot or a single molecule ) with spin - polarized tunnel contacts in a recent paper by knig and martinek  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "these authors used the keldysh formalism to derive the density - matrix rate equations for a dot in which only one level contributes to transport .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to formulate a density - matrix rate equation for quantum dots in which many electronic levels contribute to transport and to simplify the derivation of ref .  .",
    "the extension to many levels is relevant for the analysis of experimental data , since the majority of experiments feature high bias voltages at which more than one electronic level contributes to the current .",
    "@xcite    a remarkable result of our study is that a formulation in terms of density - matrix rate equations is not only needed for spin - polarized leads with non - collinear polarization directions , but that it may also be necessary for unpolarized leads or for spin - polarized leads with collinear polarization directions if the metal island has a large dimensionless conductance @xmath0 .",
    "these relatively large metal particles or quantum dots have degenerate or almost - degenerate many - electron levels .",
    "correlations between the degenerate states persist during the time an electron occupies the quantum dot and need to be accounted for using a description in terms of a density matrix .",
    "the origin of the degeneracy is that in large-@xmath0 metal grains or quantum dots electronic interactions are described by the ` universal interaction hamiltonian'.@xcite with this interaction , many - electron levels with three or more singly occupied single - electron levels are degenerate if their spin is not maximal .",
