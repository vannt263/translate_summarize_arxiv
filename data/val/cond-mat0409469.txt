    "quasi one - dimensional compounds can display a rich variety of phases , including spin - peierls , charge density wave , spin density wave , and superconducting orders@xcite . due to the large anisotropy in their crystal structure , these materials are often modelled as a collection of weakly coupled luttinger liquids .",
    "the wealth of phases seen in these compounds is then attributed to the intrinsic instability of one dimensional electron systems towards the formation of quasi long range order@xcite .",
    "as temperature is lowered , correlations along individual chains grow , until the coupling between chains stabilize true long range order . in the current paper , we follow this approach to study the interplay between triplet superconductivity ( tsc ) and antiferromagnetism ( af ) in quasi one - dimensional electron systems . the starting point of our discussion is an observation that , for weak umklapp scattering , one - dimensional luttinger liquids at half - filling have so(4 ) symmetry at the boundary between af and tsc phases . near this boundary , the two order parameters can be unified using so(4 ) symmetry , leading to strong constrains on the topology of the phase diagram and on the spectrum of low energy collective excitations .",
    "our analysis is motivated by quasi one - dimensional bechgaard salts ( tmtsf)@xmath0x , and their sulphurated counterparts ( tmttf)@xmath0x . the most well studied material from this family ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 is an antiferromagnetic insulator at ambient pressure and becomes a superconductor at high pressure@xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 is not yet fully established@xcite , but there is strong evidence that electron pairing is spin triplet : the superconducting t@xmath2 is strongly suppressed by disorder @xcite ; critical magnetic field @xmath3 in the interchain direction exceeds the paramagnetic limit @xcite ; the electron spin susceptibility , obtained from the knight shift measurements , does not decrease below tc @xcite . in another material from this family , ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath4 , superconductivity is stable at ambient pressure and also shows signatures of triplet pairing@xcite .",
    "insulator to superconductor transition as a function of pressure has also been found for ( tmtsf)@xmath0asf@xmath1@xcite and ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1@xcite .",
    "there are two aspects of the so(4 ) symmetry between antiferromagnetism and triplet superconductivity that we address in this paper .",
    "_ classical so(4 ) symmetry_.   we consider the possible emergence of the classical ( static ) symmetry at a finite temperature critical point .",
    "we introduce a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy to describe the interaction between the af and tsc orders , and we study the effects of thermal fluctuations through a large @xmath5 expansion and renormalization group ( rg ) analyses in @xmath6 and @xmath7 dimensions . for a unitary tsc , which we argue to describe bechgaard salts ,",
    "we find a first order transition between af and tsc phases , a first order transition between af and normal phases ending in a tricritical point , and a weakly first order transition between tsc and normal phases .",
    "for a non - unitary tsc we find a mixed phase in which af and tsc orders are present simultaneously .",
    "we argue that the system is close to having an so(4 ) symmetric tetracritical point , but there is a narrow line of direct first order transitions between the normal and the mixed phase .",
    "( for a detailed discussion of the distinction between unitary and non - unitary tsc , see sec .",
    "[ incommensuratesection ] . )    _ quantum so(4 ) symmetry_.   we introduce a quantum so(4 ) rotor model which encapsulates key features of the competition between af and tsc orders .",
    "we use this model to study collective excitations in the system in various phases .",
    "we argue that the @xmath8-excitation , which gives one of the generators of the so(4 ) algebra , should give rise to a sharp resonance in spin polarized neutron scattering in the tsc phase .",
    "we further predict that in the case of a unitary tsc the energy of the @xmath8-resonance should decrease to nearly zero at the phase boundary with the af phase .",
    "such mode softening is not expected generally near a first order transition and would be a unique signature of the enhanced symmetry at the transition point .",
    "bechgaard salts belong to a class of strongly correlated electron systems displaying proximity of a superconducting state to some kind of magnetically ordered insulating state .",
    "other examples include the high tc cuprates@xcite , heavy fermion superconductors@xcite , and in most cases the superconducting ( sc ) order parameter is spin singlet ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 wave ) and the insulating state has antiferromagnetic or spin density wave order .",
    "symmetry principles have been introduced to study the competition of order parameters in some of these systems . in s.c .",
    "zhang s so(5 ) theory of high t@xmath2 superconductivity@xcite , antiferromagnetism and @xmath10-wave superconductivity are treated as components of a five dimensional order parameter .",
    "in addition to the generators of the usual charge so(2 ) and spin so(3 ) symmetries , new @xmath11-operators are introduced , which rotate superconductivity and antiferromagnetism into each other .",
    "a combination of analytical approximations and numerical results can be used to argue an approximate so(5 ) theory of a class of two dimensional lattice models , such as the hubbard and the @xmath12-@xmath13 model @xcite .",
    "the so(5 ) symmetry has also been used to discuss quasi two - dimensional organic @xmath14-bedt - ttf salts@xcite .",
    "the unification approach based on higher symmetries has been generalized to several other types of competing states .",
    "so(5 ) and so(8 ) symmetries have been used to classify possible many - body ground states in electronic ladders @xcite .",
    "so(6 ) symmetry has been introduced to discuss competing striped phases and superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite so(4 ) symmetry has been used to combine @xmath9-wave superconductivity and charge density wave orders in the negative @xmath15 hubbard model@xcite , as well as @xmath10-wave superconductivity and @xmath10-density wave phases @xcite . it was also suggested that the so(5 ) algebra can be used to combine ferromagnetism and triplet superconductivity in quasi two - dimensional sr@xmath0ruo@xmath4 @xcite , although the existence of microscopic models with such symmetry has not been demonstrated .",
    "there are several reasons why bechgaard salts , and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 in particular , are promising candidates for experimental observation of the emergence of high symmetry from the competition of two orders . the insulator to superconductor transition in these materials is tuned by pressure , so the entire phase diagram can be explored in a single sample .",
    "this compares favorably to the cuprate superconductors , where the af / sc transition appears as a function of doping and different samples are required to investigate various regimes .",
    "another important advantage of bechgaard salts is that they may be well described by a microscopic luttinger liquid hamiltonian , for which we can demonstrate the existence of so(4 ) symmetry using standard bosonization analysis .",
    "this is in contrast to the high tc cuprates , in which approximations need to be made in order to even define generators of the so(5 ) symmetry @xcite . a related issue is the question of quasiparticles in the af insulating state and in the @xmath10-wave superconducting phase . in the former case",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum is fully gapped while in the latter case there are nodal quasiparticles .",
    "it is not presently known how this difference affects a quantum so(5 ) symmetry for collective bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "an advantage of the so(4 ) symmetry in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 is that quasiparticles are fully gapped in both the superconducting and the insulating phases .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments demonstrated the existence of strong af fluctuations in a triplet superconductor @xmath16@xcite .",
    "this material is not quasi one - dimensional , but it has nested pieces of the fermi surface ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "thus , we expect that this material may also show some qualitative features of the competition between af and tsc discussed in this paper .",
    "we note that our approach is phenomenological in nature , since we do not attempt to obtain luttinger parameters starting from microscopic considerations .",
    "instead , we observe that bechgaard salts remain strongly anisotropic even close to the af / tsc phase boundary .",
    "hence , we argue that the luttinger parameter should be such that individual 1d chains should be in the vicinity of such phase transition . by starting with the luttinger hamiltonian",
    ", we derive the so(4 ) symmetry as its immediate consequence .",
    "we note , however , that the luttinger liquid physics is not a necessary requirement for observing so(4 ) symmetry near the af / tsc phase boundary .",
    "several groups have argued that near the tsc phase of bechgaard salts , the interchain tunneling is sufficient to suppress luttinger liquid behavior in favor of a strongly anisotropic fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "we will argue below that an approximate classical so(4 ) symmetry will be present near the af / tsc boundary even if the ordered phases arise from a fermi liquid state , although we still rely on the assumption that interchain hopping of electrons is much smaller than intrachain hopping ( this condition is satisfied for bechgaard salts , see sec .",
    "[ sectioninterchain ] ) .",
    "similarly , we expect that the @xmath8 resonance will be present even in a strongly anisotropic fermi liquid , whose observation will verify the approximate quantum so(4 ) symmetry . in this paper , for concreteness , we will concentrate on the case where the ordered phases emerge from luttinger liquid behavior on individual chains .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ luttingersection ]",
    "we discuss the luttinger liquid model for interacting electrons in one dimension . for incommensurate band filling , we show that along the transition line between the tsc and the sdw phases , this model has so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) symmetry . at half - filling",

    "in addition , due to the absence of umklapp at incommensurate filling , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are conserved separately . as shown in appendix [ bosonization ] using bosonization , when the condition ( [ luttingerso4condition ] ) is satisfied , the @xmath49 operators also commute with the hamiltonian . hence , the system has full so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) symmetry at the phase boundary between tsc and sdw phases .",
    "we emphasize that the so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) symmetry of luttinger liquids at the sdw / tsc boundary is generic and does not require fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "so(4)@xmath50 invariance has been discussed in quasi one - dimensional systems with highly anisotropic spin interactions@xcite .",
    "the @xmath49 operators in ( [ thetaoperator ] ) are reminiscent of the @xmath51 operators introduced by c.n .",

    "hence , the rows of order parameter @xmath68 transform in the vector representation of the so(4)@xmath44 group .      in bechgaard salts",
    "( tmtsf)@xmath0x , three out of every four conduction states are occupied . at quarter filling , umklapp processes involving interactions of four electrons are allowed .",
    "such interactions are weak , and furthermore are irrelevant in the rg sense for @xmath69 ( we remind the readers that we are interested in the regime near the sdw / tsc boundary , where @xmath70)@xcite . on the other hand , due to structural dimerization in bechgaard salts@xcite , a gap splits the conduction band into a completely filled lower band and a half - filled upper band . hence , bechgaard salts are half - filled systems . at half filling , the hamiltonian ( [ luttinger_hamiltonian ] ) must be modified to include two - electron umklapp scattering processes , @xmath71 analysis of the phase diagram of luttinger liquids at half - filling reveals that there is still a direct transition between af and tsc orders at @xmath30 , although this condition now corresponds@xcite to @xmath72 .",
    "the umklapp term allows scattering of two right moving electrons into two left moving ones , and vice versa .",
    "thus , it does not commute with the operator @xmath73 , which leads to breaking of the so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) symmetry . to understand the nature of this symmetry breaking , it is useful to rewrite ( [ umklapp ] ) in the form , _ 3 = _ q ( re(q)(-q)- im(q)(-q ) ) , [ umksdw ] where @xmath74 is the sdw order parameter at center of mass momentum @xmath75 , ( ) = _ kssa^_+,ks_ssa_-,k - qs. equation ( [ umksdw ] ) shows explicitly that umklapp tends to pin the phase of the sdw order parameter at either 0 or @xmath11 , depending on the sign of @xmath76 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that period two antiferromagnetic order can be described by a single real nel vector",
    ".    we will show in section [ sectionhalffillinggl ] that , whereas the ginzburg - landau free energy is no longer so(3)@xmath77so(4)@xmath44 symmetric at half - filling , to linear order in @xmath76 it maintains an so(4)=so(3)@xmath77so(3)@xmath44 symmetry .",

    "since we are mostly interested in applying our results to bechgaard salts , we focus mostly on this so(4 ) symmetry in ref . , as well as on the remainder of this paper .    unlike the so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) symmetry discussed in the incommensurate case , the so(4 ) symmetry at half - filling",
    "is not a rigorous symmetry of the system .",
    "the generators of this group do not commute with the hamiltonian of the system exactly .",
    "however , the main emphasis of our work is to understand the finite temperature phase diagram of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 . this is obtained from the classical gl free energy , which at the af / tsc phase boundary has so(4 ) symmetry if we retain umklapp processes to linear order in @xmath76 ( see discussion in section [ sectionhalffillinggl ] ) .",
    "in addition , with regards to quantum properties , so(4 ) symmetry is a good starting point to study the collective modes of the system when @xmath76 is small .",
    "the latter assumption is well justified for ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , since the observed dimerization in this material is less than 1@xmath88@xcite . for small @xmath76 ,",
    "modes found assuming so(4 ) symmetry will have a finite overlap with the actual excitations of the system .",
    "in particular , the quantum numbers of the @xmath8 mode discussed in section [ quantumsection ] , including charge two and center of mass momentum @xmath89 , are not affected by umklapp .",
    "these properties determine which experimental probes couple to @xmath8 .",
    "we must keep in mind , however , that the explicit breaking of so(4 ) due to higher order corrections in @xmath76 , and also due to interchain coupling , may give a small energy gap and finite broadening to @xmath8 , even at the af / tsc phase boundary .",
    "we also point out that , from the point of view of @xmath8 excitations , the difference between so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) and so(4 ) symmetries corresponds to the question whether @xmath90 and @xmath91 excitations are the same ( so(4 ) symmetry at half filling ) or different ( so(3)@xmath17so(4 ) symmetry away from half filling ) .",
    "thus far in the analysis we have ignored spin - orbit effects .",
    "microwave absorption experiments in ( tmtsf)@xmath0asf@xmath1 measured @xcite the anisotropy in the exchange couplings to be @xmath92 .",
    "this ultimately determines the preferred axes for the nel vector @xmath93 ( along the b - axis of the crystal @xcite ) and the spin component of the tsc order @xmath94 ( along either the a- or c - axis @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not expect such tiny anisotropy to play a significant role in determining the competition between af and tsc phases .",
    "we also point out that nmr experiments in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 find a divergence of @xmath95 at the nel temperature that is well - described by the o(3 ) isotropic heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "thus , even for critical fluctuations of the af order parameter , spin anisotropy coming from spin - orbit coupling is unobservably small .    before concluding this section we point out that the isospin algebra defined by equations ( [ chiralq ] ) , ( [ thetaoperator ] ) , and ( [ isospinluttinger ] ) can be also used to relate charge density wave order and singlet superconductivity in quasi one - dimensional electron systems@xcite",

    "the main goal of this section is to investigate consequences of the so(4 ) symmetry for the true finite temperature phase transitions , when we need to consider three dimensional fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "one may be concerned that by introducing interchain couplings , we will immediately destroy the so(4 ) symmetry . as we will show in section  [ sectioninterchain ] , even in the case where the interchain coupling @xmath96 is large enough to make the system into a highly anisotropic fermi liquid , approximate so(4 ) symmetry prevails in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy ( see e.g. eq . ( [ nearlyso4glenergy ] ) .",
    "this feature of the af / tsc gl free energy implies that our analysis of the phase diagram , based on classical so(4 ) symmetry , is valid even when the normal state is described by a highly anisotropic fermi liquid rather than a collection of weakly coupled luttinger liquids .",
    "a review of the normal state properties of organic superconductors at low magnetic fields is given in ref .  , and",
    "low temperature transport properties have been reported recently in ref .  .",
    "we illustrate the effects of interchain coupling in fig .",
    "[ quasi1d ] .",
    "as the temperature is reduced on either side of @xmath30 , the correlation length along a chain in the appropriate correlation function grows due to intrachain interactions . at some finite temperature ,",

    "the description of the system in terms of a luttinger liquid is supplanted by a gl free energy describing the interactions of the order parameters in three spatial dimensions . in this picture , for small enough @xmath96 the presence of a phase boundary between af and tsc implies that the intrachain hamiltonian is close to the so(4 ) symmetric point @xmath30 .",
    "an important assumption of our analysis is that pressure varies the value of @xmath97 and tunes the transition across the af / tsc phase boundary .",
