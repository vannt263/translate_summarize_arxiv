    "a typical outcome of wave - wave interactions is a forced vibration , which in some cases may lead to resonances .",
    "the latter can in principle facilitate a very efficient energy transfer between the two interacting sources and lead to the substantial amplification of the driven wave .",
    "historically , resonances between gravitational and electromagnetic waves have been studied primarily as a possible means of gravity - wave detection ( see  @xcite for a representative though incomplete list ) .",
    "certain nonlinear aspects of the weyl - maxwell coupling were recently investigated by employing covariant techniques , also used here , where the gravitational - wave distortions are monitored through the transverse part of shear perturbations  @xcite .",
    "part of that study assumed a minkowski background , in which case the gravito - electromagnetic interaction occurs in physical environments where the gravitational field is relatively weak .",
    "the analysis , which considered the effects of the weyl on the maxwell field and took place at the second perturbative level , showed that gravitational waves could drive and in principle resonantly amplify electromagnetic signals . also , the nonlinear nature of the coupling , meant that the resonant frequency was determined by those of the originally interacting waves and by their interaction angle .",
    "resonances occur when the driving and the driven waves oscillate in tune .",
    "the most spectacular cases are the so - called undamped resonances , where according to the `` standard picture '' the amplitude of the driven wave diverges .",
    "nevertheless , when physically reasonable / conservative initial conditions are involved , there is no divergence . instead , the amplitude of the driven wave grows linearly in time ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) . here",
    ", we continue and extend the analysis of  @xcite along these lines .",
    "we show , in particular , that the typical outcome of the weyl - maxwell resonances identified in  @xcite , is a linear in time growth of the amplitude of the gravitationally driven electromagnetic signal .",
    "this means that the longer the interaction lasts , the stronger the amplification .",
    "not surprisingly , the overall effect is also proportional to the strength of the driving gravity wave .",
    "an additional result is that the aforementioned resonances are typically preceded by a characteristic phase , during which the amplitude of the driven electromagnetic wave varies periodically . such periodic variations",
    "are known as `` beats '' and in our case occur close to the resonant frequency . more specifically ,",
    "as the system approaches the point of resonance , there is a series of beat - like signals with progressively increasing duration and amplitude .",
    "the linear ( in time ) growth of the gravitationally driven electromagnetic wave , at the resonant frequency , makes it easier to estimate its amplification and also the amount of energy transfer from the weyl to the maxwell field .",
    "the decisive factors are the amplitude of the driving gravitational wave , at the beginning of the interaction , its frequency and the duration of the gravito - electromagnetic resonance .",
    "the longer the latter lasts , the stronger the overall effect .",
    "also , the efficiency of the amplification is determined by the product between the initial amplitude and the frequency of the gravitational wave .",
    "the larger the amplitude and the higher the frequency , the better . here",
    ", we have applied our results to gravitational radiation with frequency much lower than that of its original electromagnetic counterpart . a condition that is expected to hold in most , if not all , astrophysical situations .",
    "the nonlinear interaction terms in the wave equation of the new ( the driven ) electromagnetic signal allow for the occurrence of resonances even at this case .    assuming a minkowski background means confining to environments where gravity is relatively weak .",
    "nevertheless , to maximise the possibility of efficient resonances , we need both gravitational and electromagnetic waves to coexist in relative abundance . the vicinity of compact stellar objects appears to fulfill these requirements .",
    "inspiriling systems of neutron stars and black holes , as well as supernovae explosions and spinning neutron stars , are probably the best candidates , as they are expected to produce high - frequency gravity waves ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) .",
    "there , it seems feasible to amplify electromagnetic signals by few orders of magnitude , provided that the resonant coupling between the weyl and the maxwell field holds for several seconds , or maybe for a few minutes .",
    "if so , the mechanism discussed here could provide an additional way of `` extracting '' highly energetic electromagnetic signals from sources like supernovae explosions , for example , which are also expected to produce strong gravitational waves .",
    "consider an empty and static minkowski spacetime , we allow for the propagation of linear gravitational and electromagnetic radiation . our aim is to study the interaction between these two sources at the second perturbative level , and in particular how the former affects the latter .",
    "electromagnetic waves are described by the source - free version of maxwell s equations . on a minkowski background , these lead to a pair of formalistically identical plane - wave equations for the components of the electromagnetic field . in the framework of the 1 + 3 covariant formalism",
    ", the long - range gravitational field is monitored by the weyl part of the spacetime curvature .",
    "gravitational radiation , in particular , is described by the transverse components of the electric and the magnetic weyl tensors ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively  see  ",
    "1.3.6 in  @xcite for further discussion and details ) .",
    "however , the high symmetry of the minkowski space ensures that gravitational - wave perturbations can be described solely by the transverse part of the shear tensor ( @xmath2  see   [ ssgis ] below ) .",
    "this gravitationally induced shear also obeys a simple plane - wave propagation equation . all these mean that , to linear order , gravitational and electromagnetic waves propagate according to , throughout this manuscript . ]",

    "are the ( physical ) wavenumbers of the gravitational and the original electromagnetic signal , respectively , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the associated phases .",
    "it goes without saying that an expression exactly analogous to ( [ linear1]b ) monitors the linear evolution of the magnetic part of the maxwell field .",
    "we may therefore monitor the propagation of the electromagnetic waves by simply following that of its electric component .",
    "evaluating expressions ( [ linear1]a ) and ( [ linear1]b ) at @xmath8 , gives @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "then , the linear solutions ( [ linear1 ] ) recast into @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 by default . also , taking the time derivatives of the above , leads to the auxiliary relations @xmath14 where the overdots indicates differentiation with respect to the observers proper time .",
    "note that we employ observers living along worldlines tangent to the timelike 4-velocity field @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "thus , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents the covariant derivative operator , by construction . is the observers 4-velocity vector , the symmetric tensor @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 being the spacetime metric ) projects into the 3-dimensional space of these observers .",

    "also , @xmath24 defines the electric field vector , as measured in the @xmath15-frame , with @xmath25 representing the antisymmetric electromagnetic ( faraday ) tensor . ]",
    "the interaction between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation affects the propagation of both signals .",
    "gravity waves , in particular , can modify the amplitude , the wavelength , the polarisation and the direction of electromagnetic radiation . in the literature , one can find a number of studies addressing this issue from a variety of perspectives ( e.g.  @xcite-@xcite ) . here , we will consider the effects of the weyl on the maxwell field and look into the resonant amplification of the latter source by the former .",
    "assuming that the original waves were both monochromatic , the electric component ( @xmath26 ) of the electromagnetic signal that emerges from the interaction propagates according to the second - order equation @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -f(n-2k)\\sin\\left[(n - k)t+\\tilde{\\vartheta}-\\vartheta\\right]\\ , ,   \\label{nlinear1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 . also , an exactly analogous expression for its magnetic counterpart ( see  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "note that @xmath29 , namely the wavenumber of the gravitationally induced electromagnetic radiation , depends on those of the interacting waves and it is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the interaction angle . according to eq .",
    "( [ nlinear1 ] ) , the new electromagnetic signal performs a forced oscillation .",
    "also , the driving agent can be written as the superposition of two plane waves , the characteristics of which depend on those of the originally interacting sources .",
    "not surprisingly , within our adopted perturbative scheme , both the frequency and the phase of the external `` force '' are linear combinations ( sums and differences  namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) of their first - order counterparts .",
    "the outcome of the ( second order ) gravito - electromagnetic interaction described above follows from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ nlinear1 ] ) .",
    "the latter can be solved analytically , giving  @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the integration constants , @xmath36 the above , together with their magnetic analogues , monitor the evolution of the gravitationally driven electromagnetic radiation , on a minkowski background , at the second perturbative level .",
    "solution ( [ nlinear2 ] ) shows that the coupling between the weyl and the maxwell fields can lead to the resonant amplification of the latter .",
    "this happens when @xmath37 , or equivalently ( see expression ( [ f1,2]b ) above ) when @xmath38 .",
    "going back to eq .",
    "( [ vphi ] ) , the latter implies that @xmath39 and subsequently @xmath40 .",

    "this has allowed for analytical solutions monitoring the gravito - electromagnetic interaction at second order .",
    "keeping the aforementioned terms is unlikely to affect the occurrence of the resonances themselves , but it is likely to modify the setting under which these will occur . ]    the possibility of resonances , as a result of the gravito - electromagnetic interaction discussed here , is not surprising .",
    "after all , we are dealing with forced oscillations and the latter are known to provide the natural physical stage for resonances to occur . before turning out full attention to the resonant case",
    ", however , it is worth looking at a characteristic transition phase that takes place as our system approaches the point of resonance .      the mechanical analogue of the weyl - maxwell interaction , as described in eqs .",
    "( [ nlinear1 ] ) and ( [ nlinear2 ] ) , is a harmonic oscillator with two external forces of periodic behavior .",
    "resonances in the system occur within a considerable range of the external frequencies ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this opens the possibility of characteristic signals , which appear close to the resonant frequency and are known as `` beats '' .",
    "beats correspond to periodic variations in the amplitude , but at a pace slower than the internal frequency of the system .",
    "following  @xcite , we will demonstrate the occurrence of beats by rewriting solution ( [ nlinear2 ] ) in the more convenient form @xmath42 + b_2\\cos\\left[{\\pi\\over2}+(m_2t+\\omega_2)\\right]\\ , ,   \\label{bgsol1}\\ ] ] where now @xmath43 expression ( [ bgsol1 ] ) , which represents a linear superposition of three harmonic oscillations with different amplitudes and frequencies , can be recast into the complex form @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "our starting point was two linear plane waves , the electromagnetic and the gravitational , propagating freely on a minkowski background . assuming that both waves are monochromatic , we allowed them to interact at the second perturbative level .",

    "finding the solutions is a well defined problem of initial conditions and the most characteristic phenomena are _ beats _ and _ resonances_. here , we found both and provided the corresponding analytical solutions ( together with their frequency range ) in closed - form expressions .",

    "initially , the gravito - electromagnetic resonances appear in their familiar ( textbook ) form , namely as driven oscillations with diverging amplitude .",

    "we found that these resonances can occur for a fairly wide range of initial conditions .",
    "in fact , the resonant behaviour is recovered even when the gravitational - wave frequency is considerably smaller than that of its original electromagnetic counterpart .",
    "this condition is expected to hold for most gravitating sources , since the formation of an event horizon limits the gravity - wave frequency up to @xmath128 hz .",
    "the latter is much smaller than the lowest radio waves observed from various astrophysical sources .",
    "the characteristic timescale of the aforementioned linear increase of the electromagnetic wave is determined by the product of the amplitude and the frequency of the driving gravitational radiation .",
    "for example , in the favourable scenario where the gravitational radiation is in the khz band and the interaction occurs within a few schwarzschild radius from the gravitating source , the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation increases by two orders of magnitude within a few seconds . also , the linear - growth phase is preceded by a characteristic series of beat - like electromagnetic signals .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that , when combined , these effects could lead to an indirect observation of gravitational waves and/or to an electromagnetic follow up in a future gravity - wave detection incident .",
    "the typical candidates for gravito - electromagnetic resonances are astrophysical systems in advanced stages of gravitational collapse .",
    "neutron star and black hole binaries , supernovae and spinning neutron stars are probably the most promising , as they produce high - frequency gravity waves .",
    "also , the predicted energy flux of the gravitational sector is several orders of magnitude above the electromagnetic one .",
    "for instance , just before merging , binary systems of several solar masses emit close to @xmath129  erg / sec in the form of gravitational radiation .",
    "the maximum electromagnetic luminosity during a supernova explosion , on the other hand , is roughly @xmath130  erg / sec .",
    "we therefore expect the gravitational radiation to dominate and anticipate an abundance of energy in the form of gravity waves .",
    "hence , the interaction discussed here opens the possibility for an efficient transfer of this energy surplus from the gravitational to the electromagnetic sector .",
    "demonstrating that such an energy transfer can readily occur in nature and calculating its magnitude , requires more detailed theoretical models .",
    "one would also need to go beyond the analytical limits of this study and involve numerical techniques and codes to deal with the increased complexity of the problem .",
    "these will be the next steps of our research effort . +",
