    "we use a multi - phase transport ( ) model , that includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions zhang:2000bd , lin:2001cx , to study the anisotropic flows @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 of charged hadrons in asymmetric cu+au collisions at @xmath7 at .",
    "use is made of both the default version and the version with string melting , i.e. , allowing hadrons that are expected to be formed from initial strings to convert to their valence quarks and antiquarks @xcite .",
    "the latter was able to explain measured @xmath8 dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath3 of mid - rapidity charged hadrons with a parton scattering cross section of about @xmath9 while the default version seemed to give a better description of the anisotropic flows at large rapidities where the string degree of freedom dominates @xcite .",
    "we find that charged hadrons produced around midrapidity in asymmetric cu+au collisions have a stronger directed flow @xmath0 and their elliptic flow is also more sensitive to the parton scattering cross section than those found previously in symmetric au+au collisions .",

    "the model @xcite is a hybrid model that uses minijet partons from hard processes and strings from soft processes in the heavy ion jet interaction generator ( ) model @xcite as the initial conditions for modeling heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "time evolution of resulting minijet partons is described by zhang s parton cascade ( ) zhang:1997ej model . at present , this model includes only parton - parton elastic scatterings with an in - medium cross section given by : @xmath10where the strong coupling constant @xmath11 is taken to be @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the effective screening mass @xmath15 depends on the temperature and density of the partonic matter but is taken as a parameter in for fixing the magnitude and angular distribution of the parton scattering cross section .",
    "after minijet partons stop interacting , they are combined with their parent strings , as in the model with jet quenching , to fragment into hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model as implemented in the program @xcite .",
    "final - state scatterings among hadrons are then modelled by a relativistic transport ( ) model li:1995pr .",
    "the default model @xcite has been quite successful in describing measured rapidity distributions of charge particles , particle to antiparticle ratios , and spectra of low transverse momentum pions and kaons @xcite in heavy ion collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( ) and .",
    "it has also been useful in understanding the production of @xmath16 @xcite and multistrange baryons @xcite in these collisions .    since the initial energy density in heavy ion collisions at",
    "is much larger than the critical energy density at which the hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma transition would occur @xcite , the model has been extended to convert initial excited strings into partons @xcite . in this string melting scenario , hadrons ( mostly pions ) , that would have been produced from string fragmentation , are converted instead to valence quarks and/or antiquarks with current quark masses .",
    "interactions among these partons are again described by the parton cascade model . since inelastic scatterings",
    "are not included , only quarks and antiquarks from melted strings are present in the partonic matter .",
    "the transition from the partonic matter to the hadronic matter is achieved using a simple coalescence model , which combines two nearest quark and antiquark into mesons and three nearest quarks or antiquarks into baryons or anti - baryons that are close to the invariant mass of these partons .",
    "the present coalescence model is thus somewhat different from the ones recently used extensively greco , hwa , fries , molnar03 for studying hadron production at intermediate transverse momenta . using parton scattering cross sections of @xmath17-@xmath9 , the model with string melting was able to reproduce both the centrality and transverse momentum ( below @xmath18 @xmath19 ) dependence of the elliptic flow @xcite and pion interferometry @xcite measured in au+au collisions at @xmath20 at @xcite .",
    "it has also been used for studying the kaon interferometry @xcite and charm flow @xcite in these collisions .",
    "we note that above parton cross sections are significantly smaller than that needed to reproduce the parton elliptic flow from the hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "the resulting hadron elliptic flows in the model with string melting are , however , amplified by modelling hadronization via quark coalescence molnar03 , leading to a satisfactory reproduction of experimental data . as shown earlier in refs .",
