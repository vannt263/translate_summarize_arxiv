    "optical nanofibers have seen widespread use in science and engineering applications in the last thirty years@xcite . the tight confinement of the evanescent field around the optical nanofiber @xcite , unique light geometries provided by the fiber modes @xcite , low loss , and promise of improved atom - light interaction @xcite have led to increased interest in the physics community .",
    "optical micro- or nanofibers are used for sensing and detection @xcite , and coupling light to resonators @xcite , nv centers@xcite , or photonic crystals@xcite .",
    "optical nanofiber fabricated systems can be connected to an existing fiber network to provide applications in quantum information science@xcite .",
    "the development of atom traps around optical nanofibers affords new avenues of research @xcite including loss - limited hybrid quantum systems .",
    "these applications can benefit from high transmission nanofibers through a reduction in unwanted stray light fields produced from non adiabatic mode excitation and reduced laser power requirements .",
    "here we present the tools and procedures necessary to create ultrahigh transmission nanofibers .",
    "previous work has focused on the post - pull environmental controls in humidity and air purity@xcite ; here we focus on the critical pre - pull steps necessary to achieve an ultrahigh transmission before handling the known environmental effects .",
    "following the protocols and procedures we have produced fibers with 99.95 % transmission when launching the fundamental mode .",
    "we have also launched higher - order modes@xcite , where we achieve transmissions of greater than 97% for the first family of excited modes .",
    "this level of transmission has required a thorough optimization of the pulling algorithm and of the cleaning procedure . here , we explicitly explain our technique and our apparatus that produces fibers that we will use in a series of experiments in quantum hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "our pulling technique , using a well - known methodology@xcite , requires two pulling motors and a stationary oxyhydrogen heat source .",
    "the flame brushing method allows us to reliably produce optical nanofibers with controllable taper geometries and a uniform waist .",
    "the waist can vary in length from 1 to 100 mm , and we can achieve radii as small as hundreds of nanometers @xcite . rather than sweep the flame back and forth over the fiber , we keep the flame stationary ; this action prevents the creation of small air currents , which could lead to nonuniformities on the fiber waist and is equivalent to transforming to the rest frame of the flame .",
    "this transformation is applicable to other pulling techniques as well , so there would be no need to scan a heat source .",
    "other common techniques for optical nanofiber production include micro - furnaces , fusion splicers , chemical etchants , and co@xmath5 lasers @xcite .",
    "chemical etching generally produces lower transmission than other heat and pull methods and offers less control over the shape of the taper and the length of the waist .",
    "a co@xmath5 laser produces high - transmission optical nanofibers but the final diameter is limited by the power and focus of the laser . here",
    "we present , to best of our knowledge , the highest recorded transmission optical nanofibers , with a loss of 2.6 @xmath6  db / mm on the fundamental mode @xcite , with controllable taper geometries and long fiber waists which are suitable for the space and optical constraints of cryogenic environments @xcite .",

    "the granite slab serves two purposes : it is a damping weight and a flat surface .",
    "the weight of the granite slab , exceeding 100 kg , damps the recoil from the fiber motors as they change direction at the end of every pull step . without a flat surface the motors will not work to specification , leading to parasitic effects on the nanofiber : the pitch or yaw of the motor can vary the distance between the fiber and the flame , changing the effective size of the flame and pulling the fiber in various directions ( negating any pre - pull alignment ) .",

    "[ fig : pullingrig ] ) , the flame motor , that translates the flame in front of the fiber for the duration of the pulling process . the flame motor introduces and removes the heat source and during the pull we fix the horizontal distance between the nozzle and the front edge of the fiber at 0.5 mm , as depicted in fig .",

    "the entire pulling apparatus is inside a cleanroom initially specified as iso class 100 . if any fiber buffer remains or dust lands on the fiber at any time the transmission will degrade ( see sec .",

    "we launch light into a fiber and split the light with a 50/50 in - fiber beam splitter . in one output of the beam splitter we record the laser power using a thorlabs det36a photodetector .",
    "the other output is connected to a fc connectorized fiber that we fusion splice to fibercore sm800 fiber .",
    "we then place the sm800 fiber in the fiber puller and record the intensity of light through the fiber at the output of the fiber puller using another det36a for the duration of the pull .",
    "we record data on a dpo7054 tektroniks oscilloscope in high resolution mode set to collect @xmath13 samples .",
    "we normalize the signal through the fiber puller to the laser drift throughout the pull .",
    "when launching higher - order modes , a superposition of the @xmath14 family of modes , we do not use the in - fiber beam splitter .",
    "instead , we use a pick - off to track the laser drift and then free - space couple light into an sm1500 fiber from fibercore with an initial cladding diameter of 50 @xmath9 m .",
    "we generate the @xmath14 family superposition by launching a gaussian beam from a new focus vortex laser through a phase plate @xcite .",
    "one side of the phase plate writes a @xmath15 phase shift on half of the beam .",
    "this generates a two - lobed mode that approximates the @xmath16 free space optical mode .",
    "the @xmath16 free space optical mode is then coupled into an sm1500 fiber and excites a superposition of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 modes .",
    "there is less than one percent fundamental mode corruption , which we take into consideration when calculating the transmission .",
    "the setup for an ultrahigh transmission pull involves a series of cleaning and alignment steps .",
    "we outline this procedure in this section .      obtaining a high transmission through an optical nanofiber",
    "requires a detailed analysis of the pre - pull cleanliness of the fiber . if any particulate remains from the fiber buffer or if dust arrives on the fiber before being introduced to the flame , the particulate will burn and greatly diminish the final transmission , see sec .",
    "[ sec : dustaccumulation ] . furthermore , evaporate from solvents can decrease transmission .",
    "our cleaning procedure starts by mechanically removing the protective plastic buffer to expose the glass of the fiber to the flame .",
    "then we use isopropyl alcohol on lens tissue to remove larger particulate .",
    "a few wipes of acetone are then applied with class 10a cleanroom wipes from ted pella , in order to dissolve smaller remnants of the buffer .",
    "a final cleaning with methanol using class 10a cleanroom wipes removes any evaporate left from the previous solvents .",
    "after , we carefully lay the fiber into the grooves of the fiber clamps on the pulling apparatus and image the entire length of cleaned fiber using the optical microscope .",
    "if there is any visible dust , particulate , or evaporate , within the 2 @xmath9 m resolution of the optical microscope , we start the cleaning procedure over .",
    "if the fiber is clean , we proceed to align it .",
    "the alignment procedure begins by properly tensioning the fiber .",
    "we tension the fiber by moving the fiber motors apart in 200 @xmath9 m increments until the fiber slides through the fiber clamps , which typically takes 800 @xmath9 m of total displacement .",
    "this allows the fiber to reach a uniform tension .",
    "however , early measurements showed the fiber to be overtensioned : introducing the fiber to the flame will yield immediate thinning , even if the motors are stationary . as a result , we then untension the fiber in 20 @xmath9 m increments until the fiber buckles .",
    "we observe the buckling process ( the fiber bending inwards and then straightening under the inward force from the motors ) with a 2 mp usb digital microscope mounted orthogonally to the flame above the center of the fiber , see 17 in fig .  [",
    "fig : pullingrig ] .    the buckling process results in no loss in transmission and no thinning visible through the optical microscope upon introducing the fiber to the flame within the microscope s resolution of @xmath20 m .",
    "once the fiber is properly tensioned , we align the fiber such that the sections of fiber directly next to the left fiber clamp and right fiber clamp are equidistant from the optical microscope and at the same height .",
    "we translate each section of fiber in front of the optical microscope using the fiber motors , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pullingrig ] , and align the height and focus of each fiber section using the micrometers attached to the flexure stage until both images overlap . if we see a sag in the fiber caused by the buckling we carefully retention the fiber in @xmath21 m steps until the fiber is straight as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fiberalignment ] .",
    "the microscope objective has a 3 @xmath9 m depth of field , so by matching the diameter of the lensed light from the cladding and core we ensure the v - grooves of the fiber clamps on each motor are equidistant from the camera , and therefore the nozzle of the flame .",
    "this alignment is on the order of micrometers over a length of centimeters .",
    "once the images overlap , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fiberalignment ] , the fiber is ready to be pulled .",
    "here we discuss the results obtained from following the procedures outlined in the previous sections .",
    "we present details on the transmissions achieved by following cleaning and alignment procedures .",
    "finally , we detail methods to aid in understanding the entire modal evolution during the fiber pull as a final check on the quality of the nanofibers we produce .      figure  [ fig : transmission](a ) shows the transmission as a function of time during the pull for an optical nanofiber with a 2 mrad angle taper to a radius of 6 @xmath9 m and exponential profile to reach a final waist radius of 250 nm , with a fiber waist length of 5 mm .",
    "we achieve a transmission of 99.95  @xmath3  0.02  % , or a loss of 2.6 @xmath6 db / mm . the error listed in the transmission",
    "is the standard deviation .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ]  ( b ) and ( c ) a histogram of the data ranges we use to take the mean for the average value at the beginning of the pull and the average value at the end of the pull .",
    "we obtain a standard deviation of 1.0  @xmath22 for the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ]  b ) and 1.0  @xmath23 for the data in c ) .",
    "this leads to a standard deviation of the final transmission of 2.3  @xmath24 there are possible systematic errors such as drifts in the amplifier gain , but we expect them to be of the same order or smaller than the quoted standard deviation",
    ".    the final transmission is determined by taking the mean of the data after the pull ends , delineated by the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] , and dividing by the value of the normalized signal at the beginning of the pull , which we must determine .",
    "we take a cumulative average of the transmission from the beginning of the pull until just before any higher order modes are excited , see sec .",
    "[ sec : spec ] . using this",
    "we see that the transmission steadies at 99.95 % .",
    "we find this a fair method because there is no detectable loss over this range and no beating between modes [ sec : dustaccumulation ] in the signal since we have yet to excite any higher order modes , and by checking the cumulative average we show that the transmission listed is steady and a lower bound .",
    "previous work has focused on telecom light at 1550 nm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : brambrev ] we plot the propagation loss as a function of optical nanofiber radius for different pulling techniques as compiled in ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "we extend the axes to overlay our results .",
    "figure  [ fig : brambrev ] shows that the lowest loss for previous work on the fundamental mode is on the order of 10@xmath25 db / mm at 1550 nm , with final radii of between 440 - 600 nm .",
    "our result for the fundamental mode has a loss of 2.6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 db / mm when the loss is taken over the entire 84 mm stretch .",
    "if the loss is only attributed to the 5 mm waist this becomes 4.34@xmath1 10@xmath4 db / mm .",
    "these results mark an improvement of two orders of magnitude over previous work @xcite . for higher - order mode",
    "pulls using sm1500 fiber with an initial diameter of 50 @xmath9 m , the taper angle was 0.4 mrad until a radius of 6 @xmath9 m and then had an exponential profile until reaching a uniform waist radius of 280 nm .",
    "here we achieved a loss of 5 @xmath23 db / mm , when taken over the entire stretch , which represents less loss than the previous results for fundamental mode launches .",
    "since the v number is proportional to the fiber radius divided by the input wavelength we find it fair to compare our results at a wavelength of 780 nm to the results in fig .",
    "( [ fig : brambrev])at 1550 nm by scaling our final radius by a factor of 2 .",
    "the solid red circle and blue square in fig .  [ fig : brambrev ] represent the actual radius of the pull while the open red circle and blue square are designed to scale our results to equivalent v numbers for inputs at 1550 nm and represent an effective radius .",
    "this means our effective final radius for the fundamental mode is   500 nm and for the higher modes   640 nm .",
    "this ultra - high transmission is reproducible to better than   1% over time with the same fiber , when following the cleaning and alignment procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : pp ] .    using a numerical maxwell s equations solver ,",
    "fimmprop@xcite , we simulate the expected transmission through a fiber with the same profile as in our pulls .",
    "we find the expected transmission to be 99.97%@xcite , through a @xmath26 taper profile matching the 2 mrad pull depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] , which is consistent with our experimental result that measures the transmission through the entire nanofiber .",
    "furthermore , when launching the next family of modes through the fiber the fimmprop simulations were well - matched to the achieved transmissions@xcite .",
    "this implies that we are not limited by the pulling apparatus .      .",
    "the excited curves correspond to higher - order modes of the same symmetry as the fundamental mode : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . ]",
    "we analyze the quality of the nanofiber using a spectrogram , a short - time fourier transform of the transmission data , also sometimes referred to as the gabor transform .",
    "the spectrogram allows us to extract the entire modal evolution in the nanofiber during the pull .",
    "each curve corresponds to the evolving spatial beat frequency between the fundamental mode and excited modes propagating in the fiber , while the contrast corresponds to the energy transferred from the fundamental mode .",
    "following this we can use theory and simulation to identify all modes that are excited during the pull . a detailed description , with full theoretical background ,",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    figure  [ fig : spec ] is a spectrogram of the transmission data from fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] . we see that for a successful 2 mrad pull with sm800 fiber we expect to observe a few higher order mode excitations .",
    "if modes are excited that are asymmetric to the fundamental mode , we know the cylindrical symmetry of the fiber was broken during the pulling process@xcite , which can aid in identifying and fixing the error in the pulling apparatus .",
    "it is worth noting that the modal excitation remains in the family of the same symmetry as the fundamental mode . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first report of modal excitation that remained purely in the symmetric family of modes .",
    "previous work has seen asymmetric excitations to the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 modes@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dustaccumulation ] , we demonstrate this is not the case for an uncleaned fiber .",
    "once the pull is complete the fiber is transferred to a hv chamber beneath a hepa filter . without keeping the fiber in a clean environment",
    "the transmission will degrade * ? ? ? * as dust accumulates on the surface of the nanofiber waist and taper , which will cause the fiber to break under high powers in vacuum due to heating @xcite .    to prevent the leakage current from impinging on the nanofiber , we avoided direct line of sight between the ion pump and the nanofiber by placing the ion pump on an elbow .",
    "then between the elbow and the ion pump we placed a grounding mesh to prevent the electric field from penetrating past the mesh . with this arrangement",
    "a 250 nm radius nanofiber has withstood the application of more than 400 @xmath3 12 mw from a ti : sapphire laser at 760 nm in hv conditions .",
    "we provide the necessary procedures to clean , prepare , and pull an ultrahigh transmission nanofiber in a reproducible way .",
    "the work is validated through microscopy , and we present the transmission results of a standard 2 mrad pull yielding a transmission of 99.95 @xmath3 0.02% or loss of 2.6  @xmath30  db / mm , an improvement of two orders of magnitude for the fundamental mode . when launching higher - order modes we have losses of 5 @xmath23 db / mm .",
    "the transmission results are in excellent agreement with transmission simulations , implying the limiting factor in transmission comes from a lack of pre - pull cleanliness .",

    "a section of fiber , less than a millimeter in length , is brought to its softening point using a clean oxyhydrogen flame and then pulled by two high - precision motors .",
    "+ our algorithm , based on the work of the originally mainz and currently vienna group@xcite , calculates the trajectories of the motors needed to produce a fiber with the desired final radius , length of uniform waist , and taper geometry .",
    "the tapers are formed by a series of small sections that are well approximated by lines , allowing us to form a linear taper with a given angle down to a radius of 6 @xmath9 m , which connects to an exponential that smoothly reduces to a submicron radius , typically 250 nm .",
    "the slope of the linear section generally varies between 0.3 and 5 mrad .",

    "the model produces a velocity profile that is a square wave in time .",
    "experimentally , we approximate the square wave in three parts :    1 .   a ramp up to @xmath33 2 .   a constant pull velocity equal to @xmath33 3 .   a ramp down in velocity to zero .    where @xmath34 is the velocity of the flame in step n and @xmath35 is the velocity that the fiber motors move apart",
    "the addition of @xmath34 arises from the transformation to the rest frame of the flame .",
    "typically , @xmath34 is an order of magnitude greater than @xmath35 . when transforming to the rest frame of the flame , both motors move in the direction the flame would have swept in that step .",
    "the motor whose pull velocity is in the same direction as the flame motion will lead while the other motor will lag .",
    "we have verified this sequence using the encoder of the motor that allows us to record the trajectory of the motors and by looking at the output of a michelson interferometer with one arm spanning the two motorized stages .",
    "one experimental parameter fundamental to the algorithm is the effective size of the flame , @xmath36 , which corresponds to the zone of the fiber inside the flame that melts and thins during the pulling process .",
    "the softening point for the fused silica used by fibercore for the sm800 fiber occurs at 1585@xmath7 c. the best way to evaluate this is to measure the impact of the flame on the fiber , since our flame can not be observed by eye .",
    "working with reproducible conditions requires that we fix the working distance between the fiber and the nozzle . as a consequence ,",
    "the fiber is always at the same spot inside the flame and always sees the same distribution of temperature .",
    "we check the distance with a microscope before each pull and fix it to 400 @xmath3 50 @xmath9 m .",
    "we measure @xmath36 by fixing the flame and letting both motors move apart at a constant velocity .",
    "conservation of volume leads to an exponential profile with a waist of length @xmath36 , and the radius profile is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the heating time and @xmath32 the unmodified radius of the fiber .",

    "the measurement consists of fixing the pulling velocity at 0.05 mm / s , varying the heating time from 2 to 32 s , and then measuring the final radius of the waist .",
    "we limit ourselves to times less than 40 seconds to stay within the 2 @xmath9 m resolution of our imaging system .",
    "we characterize the size of the flame by plotting @xmath40 as a function of @xmath39 we obtain a fit with a reduced @xmath41 of 1.07 that yields @xmath42 mm .",
    "this parameter should be checked from time to time as the pulling apparatus is used since it can vary by a small amount .",
    "measuring the length of the waist or fitting the profiles of the taper to an exponential are less accurate methods than the above procedure because eq .",

    "we keep the flame fixed , which means that our hot zone is not uniform . during the actual pulling procedure we sweep , which creates an effective uniform hot zone . here , the section of fiber located at the central point of the flame is thinned the most , as a result it is more accurate to measure the profile of the fiber after tapering and find the smallest radius to extract the value of @xmath36 .",
    "we validate the accuracy of our simulation of the expected fiber profile using both an @xmath11 optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",

    "an edge finding technique then measures the profile of the fiber at different cuts .",
    "the error in the measured radius is dominated by a systematic error of  @xmath32.5 @xmath9 m due to the finite resolution of the imaging system .",
    "we first use an image of the unmodified fiber , which has a diameter of 125.1 @xmath9 m , to determine the pixel to micron conversion .",
    "the number of pixels measured for an unmodified fiber has an error of a few pixels as a result of the resolution of the optical microscope .",
    "we then binarize the gray levels of the pixels and choose a threshold such that the diameter of the unmodified fiber matches the pixel count from the previous measurement .",
    "the edge finding technique itself has an error of about 0.5 pixels for a flat length of fiber resulting from the binarization process .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile ]  ( b ) displays the relative difference between the measured image radius and the simulated radius normalized to the expected radius .",
    "the largest deviation is slightly larger than 2% , while the rms value is 0.0187 .",

    "the error is systematic , coming from the scaling factor associated with the sem calibration .",
    "we attribute this small disagreement to thermal forces that push the fiber away from the nozzle at the end of the pull when the fiber is thin .",

    "any particulate accumulation on the optical fiber before the pull begins will compromise the quality of the optical nanofiber : it will degrade the transmission , excite higher order modes , change the modal evolution , and scatter light .",
    "if any particulate accumulates on the fiber before the pull , the maximum possible transmission for a given taper geometry will not be achieved .",
    "using fimmprop , as described in [ sec : transmission ] , we have a sense of what this ideal transmission is for a given geometry , and if our transmission deviates , it can generally be attributed to a lack of proper cleaning . if the nanofiber environment is not clean or has a high humidity the transmission will decrease after a pull is finished@xcite .",
    "furthermore , if any dust accumulates on the nanofiber surface , it will not withstand high powers under vacuum .",
    "if the fiber is not properly cleaned before pulling , the final transmission can vary by a few percent .",
    "figure  [ dirt ] displays the extreme case of mechanically stripping the buffer and not cleaning the fiber at all before pulling . here",
    ", the transmission is only 80.5% for a 2 mrad taper down to @xmath43 nm , leading to more than a 19% loss in transmission when compared to a properly cleaned fiber .",

    "[ dirt ] ( b ) shows excitation to excited asymmetric mode : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , identified by arrows , that were not present when the fiber was properly cleaned .",
    "it is further interesting that there is more energy transferred to these asymmetric modes than any other modes .    before every pull",
    ", we follow the cleaning procedure described in sec .  [",
    "sec : cleaningprocedure ] . after imaging the fiber ,",
    "we decide whether or not we should start the pull or restart the cleaning process .",
    "we restart if anything is obstructing the light traveling through the fiber reaching the ccd .",
    "when there is particulate attached on top of or below the fiber , we use a wipe with methanol and remove it . if there is nothing observable within the resolution of the optical microscope we proceed with the pull .",
    "when we do not follow these criteria the reproducibility in the transmission will change by a few percent .",
    "when we apply this cleaning method , the variability between runs is better than 1  % .",
    "the origin of the particulate can come in various forms : remnants of plastic buffer , solvent evaporate , or any small particulate floating in the air .",
    "we believe the most common source to be the buffer . since we use a mechanical fiber stripper to remove the buffer , micro or macroscopic pieces of buffer remain on the fiber after stripping .",
    "we apply wipes to remove the buffer remnants .",
    "this removal process can be imperfect because mechanical strippers are not designed to make contact with the actual glass of the fiber .",
    "buffer remnants are a particularly insidious form of particulate .",
    "the plastic is generally designed with a higher index of refraction than the cladding to help remove cladding modes .",
    "if the buffer remains , we believe it may burn into the fiber .",
    "this higher index irregularity can lead to an excitation of higher order modes .    during the pull",
    "there may be signatures that the fiber was not properly cleaned .",
    "these take the form of large losses in transmission and the excitation of higher order modes .",
    "if there is initially loss or beating in the transmission this is a sign that the fiber was not properly cleaned ; this is displayed in fig .",
    "[ dirt](a ) .",
    "the fiber starts single mode in the core and therefore there should be no beating between modes and negligible losses in the initial pulling process , before the fundamental mode becomes a cladding mode , in which the tapering process reduces the effective index of refraction to and then below the index of refraction of the cladding .",
    "as the fiber continues to taper and the effective index of refraction of the fundamental mode approaches the index of refraction of the cladding , the mode begins to leak from the core .",
    "this is when higher order mode excitation can occur . for the sm800 fiber used in this study ,",
    "the transition occurs at a radius of 19.4 @xmath9 m .",
    "this transition is captured by media   1 in fig .",
    "[ mov : transition ] . here , we see that as the radius reduces , the effective index of refraction approaches the index of refraction of the cladding and the mode begins to leak from the core .",
    "if the beating between higher order modes occurs before this point , this is evidence that the fiber was damaged .",
    "a nanofiber with a 2  mrad geometry , if handled properly , typically excites only three higher order modes : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ dirt](b ) , each curve corresponds to beating between different modes and we can identify more than twenty excited modes as a result of the buffer remnants .    furthermore , any dust on the nanofiber will cause it to break under high power in vacuum . the cleanroom environment and",
    "the cleanliness of our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to achieve nanofibers that transmit more than 400 @xmath3 12 mw in an hv environment .",
    "we believe that chemically removing the buffer could be beneficial to the fiber transmission .",
    "chemical removal can lead to less mechanical damage to the fiber and properly remove all of the buffer .",
    "this is not a critical issue , since our transmission is in good agreement with simulations from fimmprop , but it could improve reproducibility and ease the cleaning process .",
