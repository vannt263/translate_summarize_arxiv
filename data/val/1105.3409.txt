    "the prevailing @xmath1cdm cosmological model has been very successful in explaining many observations of the universe .",
    "however , inflation - exponential expansion within the first @xmath2  s - has many uncertain details ; indeed it lacks strong confirmation .",
    "inflationary models predict a background of gravity waves @xcite which produce a curl - like , or `` b - mode '' pattern of polarization on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on scales greater than @xmath3 , which can not be produced by density perturbations @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of this signal is characterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath4 , which is constrained by current measurements of the temperature power spectrum and temperature - polarization cross - correlation to a value @xmath5 @xcite . to put tight constraints on inflationary models @xcite we need to detect the primordial b - mode signal , or constrain it for @xmath6 .",
    "this requires measurement of polarization fluctuations at the level of 10  nk .    to measure",
    "this signal level is challenging , and good control of systematics is required @xcite .",
    "a number of ground - based ( quiet @xcite , polarbear @xcite ) , balloon - based ( ebex @xcite , spider @xcite ) and satellite - based ( planck @xcite ) experiments have been , or are close to being , fielded with the raw sensitivity to detect the b - mode signal if it is present at a reasonable @xmath4 .",
    "these experiments are all designed to have low , and stable , instrumental polarization ( ip ) , and often include a modulation strategy to assist with reducing systematics and mitigating against @xmath7 noise .",
    "the majority of these experiments hold their optics stationary with respect to the receiver , and scan the cryostat and optics together ; a notable exception being the tenerife experiment @xcite .",
    "scanning the cryostat places requirements on the stability with respect to accelerations and tilts .",
    "although cryogenic receivers have been demonstrated that are stable at different tilt angles @xcite , the sensitivity to accelerations has not been demonstrated .",
    "a system can be imagined , however , which combines a stationary receiver with a fold mirror . besides the simplification of the cryogenic requirements , the large reduction in the mass of moving components would make the design of the steerable mount much simpler .",
    "we investigate such a system in this paper . in section  [ sec : instrument ]",
    "we describe the system , and review the production of polarization from reflections . in section  [ sec : sims ] we describe a fiducal scan strategy and simulation pipeline .",
    "results from this pipeline are then presented and discussed , along with other potential problems in section  [ sec : problems ] .",
    "for this investigation , we consider a horn fed receiver and compact range antenna ( cra ) , placed in a groundscreen , nominally observing the horizon .",
    "the output beam of the cra is then steered to the sky with a single , flat , fold mirror . although the flat mirror would be large ; @xmath8  m , such a system can be considered .",
    "the flat mirror is then tipped and tilted such that the beam of the telescope moves across the sky to allow observations .",
    "off - normal reflections , as caused by this folding , induce a polarization .",
    "the effect is well known and is the principle behind , for example , the `` pile - of - plates polarizer '' .",
    "the fresnel equations give the reflection coefficients for incident angle @xmath9 and transmission angle @xmath10 for an incident wave with e - field parallel to the boundary , @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 and @xmath14 for a metal plate , we use the relation for the complex index of refraction , @xmath15 for a general dielectric , the conductivity @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the radiation frequency . for a good conductor",
    ", we can assume @xmath20 , and so @xmath21 plugging this into snell s law allows calculation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for a pure aluminium plate , @xmath22  @xmath23 , we find @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus an unpolarized input reflected with @xmath26 would have an overall polarization of @xmath27 this ignores the phase - delay from the reflections , which elliptically polarizes the reflected beam , producing both circular polarization and rotating the plane of polarization . using a drude - lorentz model to calculate @xmath28 and @xmath29 for aluminium at 90ghz@xcite",
    ", we calculate that the plane of polarization is rotated by an additional @xmath30 degrees when the phase delay is included .",
    "ignoring this is then valid as this is a much smaller than the effect from differential reflection ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the reflection is a total power to polarization conversion ( @xmath32 ) ; in the context of a cmb polarization measurement the total power is 2.7  k , and so the induced polarized signal is then @xmath0200  @xmath33 , higher than even the ee polarization spectrum .",
    "however , the signal is changing consistently with the scan , and so is varying on different scales from the cmb signals of interest and so could , in principle , be removed . in the next section , we describe the pipeline with which we investigate the effect on cmb reconstruction and @xmath34 estimation .",
    "we note in passing that it is possible to construct a two mirror system that provides a fold with no net polarization .",
    "consider a beam travelling along the @xmath35 axis .",
    "the first mirror , mounted at 45@xmath36 to the @xmath37 plane , then reflects the beam so it is travelling along the @xmath38 axis , and the second , mounted at 45@xmath36 to the @xmath39 plane , reflects that beam along the @xmath40 . as the reflection axes have switched , both input @xmath41 and @xmath42 receive an attenuating factor of @xmath43 .",
    "any net polarization is then due to differences between the conductivity of the mirrors .",
    "if the two mirrors are fixed relative to each other , and allowed to rotate about the @xmath35 axis , the beam can be steered .",
    "a second set of mirrors , in a similar configuration , can be added to allow full beam steering around the sky .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : nonetpolarization ] .",
    "we simulate observations with the following four step pipeline .",
    "firstly , time ordered data ( tod ) is simulated with 100hz sampling for four 3-hour observation periods , corresponding to a day of observations , and the sky location ( ra , dec ) , telescope pointing direction ( az , el ) , and observed @xmath44 and @xmath45 recorded .",
    "the input cmb maps were produced by simulating a power spectrum with camb @xcite , and producing a realization with the healpix @xcite _ synfast _ routine .",
    "this input all - sky map was also convolved with a gaussian beam with fwhm of 5.5 arcmin .",
    "parameters used in the simulation are listed in table  [ tab : simparams1 ] .",
    "note that we include the monopole in this simulation , with a temperature of 2.7  k and so @xmath46  k.    it is generally desirable for ground - based and suborbital experiments to scan the sky at constant elevation to minimize the effect of variable airmass .",
    "we follow this and consider the proposed clover scan strategy , the optimization of which is fully described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the strategy is to perform azimuthal scans at fixed elevation ( nominally @xmath47 ) as the chosen sky patch rises for around 1 hour , continually adjusting the azimuthal center to achieve as circular a patch as possible .",
    "once the patch has risen sufficiently through the scan , the elevation is increased , nominally to @xmath48 , and the patch continues to rise for another 3 hours .",
    "the same strategy is used as the patch sets , giving four distinct data streams for a single patch during a 8 - 12-hour observation period .",
    "the second step in the pipeline is to take the pointing from the tod data , determine the angle of the flat folding mirror , rotate the observed @xmath44 and @xmath45 to align with the plane of the mirror , apply the calculated @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and then rotate back .",
    "the tod is then naively binned to produce t , q and u maps , following the map - making scheme outlined in @xcite , and then written out as a healpix format fits files .",
    "we make maps at @xmath49 so that the multipole range @xmath50 to @xmath51 is retrievable , and avoid holes in the maps by simulating a five pixel focal plane .",
    "the pixel angular positions from boresight are listed in table  [ tab : simparams1 ] .    finally , the angular power spectrum ( aps ) coefficients @xmath52 are estimated using the _ anafast _ healpix routine .",
    "we apply a circular mask of radius @xmath53 with a simple cosine - squared taper of width @xmath54 at the edge .",
    ".simulation parameters .",
    "detector positions are given in ( az , el ) in the telescope frame .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]          in order to determine the effect for a mirror at an arbitrary orientation , two angles are required ; the angle of incidence , @xmath9 and the angle , @xmath55 , between the mirror and the horizon as seen by the incident photons . consider the the flat fold mirror to be at the origin , and the unit vector * a * points to the dewar , and * b * points to the position on the sky being observed .",
    "this is is illustrated in figure  [ fig : defineab ] .",
    "@xmath56 is the angle between * a * and * b*. in polar coordinates , @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the the elevation and azimuth of the sky location . converting into cartesian coordinates , we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to determine @xmath56 , we take the dot - product of * a * and * b * and get @xmath63 as the angles of incidence and reflection , @xmath9 and @xmath64 are equal , we have @xmath65    we define @xmath41 to be parallel to the horizon , and @xmath42 to be `` upwards '' towards the zenith .",
    "we require the angle @xmath55 by which @xmath41 and @xmath42 need to be rotated ( around the line of sight ) so that the rotated @xmath41 is parallel to the mirror .",
    "we define @xmath66 , a unit vector that points in the same direction as @xmath41 , so , in polar , coordinates , @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is parallel to the mirror . by taking the dot product of @xmath69 with @xmath66",
    ", we can determine the angle @xmath55 as @xmath70 after some algebra , @xmath71 thus we have the angle of incidence , @xmath9 , required for the calculation above , and we have the angle , @xmath55 , so that the @xmath11 and @xmath12 factors can be applied to the rotated @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we use camb to simulate a sky , observe it with our scanning strategy code , and follow the pipeline through to calculate power spectra .",
    "firstly we test our pipeline by ignoring the effect of the fold mirror ; resultant aps are shown in figure  [ fig : goodflatten ] . in the region of interest ( @xmath721001000 )",
    "the output spectra match the input spectra well for tt and ee .",
    "the spectra from the masked pipeline maps for tt and ee are slightly supressed for larger @xmath73 ; 5% at at @xmath74 when compared to the spectra made from the full sky maps .",
    "however , as the spectra from the masked full sky maps are also supressed , we conclude that this is due to the effect of the partial sky mask and fairly naive apodization procedure . similarly , the bb spectra from the masked map is higher than the all - sky map , but as the pipeline bb spectra agrees with the masked all - sky map bb spectra , we conclude that it is the mask rather than the map - making procedure which is increasing the bb power . although this level of analysis is not sufficient for a full b - mode experiment , this level of analysis is sufficient for investigating the effect of the flat - fold mirror .",
    "we then apply the effect of a flat fold mirror in the pipeline , using the resistivity of aluminium of @xmath75  @xmath23 , and observations at 90ghz .",
    "a section of the time stream is shown in figure  [ fig : timestream ] , both the input and output @xmath44 and the azimuth of the observed sky location .",
    "the correlation between induced polarization with observed sky azimuth is clear .",
    "the induced polarization is big , and so it is reasonable to remove it without requiring the entire data set . by applying the reverse of the observing algorthim , we can determine a `` pre - mirror '' @xmath41 and @xmath42 for a given mirror resitivity .",
    "we use @xmath76 , summed over the day of observation for a particular pixel , as a measure of the amount of polarization , and minimize it by varying the resistivity , using the nelder - mead simplex direct search @xcite , implemented in matlab .",
    "this time - line can then be re - inserted into the pipeline , maps made and spectra computed .",
    "the resultant aps are shown in figure  [ fig : goodflatten ] .",
    "we see that in the range @xmath72 1001000 , the tt , ee and bb spectra all match the pipeline output as before . in order to show problems",
    "more clearly , we also plot the difference between the spectra produced from the maps with and without the flat fold mirror .",
    "these are shown against @xmath73 in figure  [ fig : spectraratios ] .",
    "we find that the tt and ee spectra are reconstructed well , with less than 1% difference between @xmath73 of 250 and 900 .",
    "the bb spectra shows both fluctuation of @xmath77 and an overall offset of 2.5% over the same @xmath73 range .",
    "the shortest required observing time , for a generalized cmb experiment , would be achieved using a photon noise limited telescope at a good site . for a instrument such as clover , situated in the atacama desert ,",
    "the system net is 175@xmath78k  @xmath79 . with a 100hz data stream",
    ", this noise level overwhelms the induced polarization signal from t @xmath80 q , u mixing . however , simple binning by a factor of ten is sufficient to see the induced polarization signal in the presence of white noise .",
    "if we add white noise at the level of 175 @xmath78k  @xmath79 , with an @xmath81  @xmath23 , the best fitting resistivity returned with this procedure is @xmath82  @xmath23 .",
    "detector @xmath7 noise is assumed to be unimportant , assuming a detector - based modulation strategy is implemented ( e.g.  using a rotating or stepped half - wave plate such as ebex , or a fast detector switching such as quiet ) .",
    "atmospheric @xmath7 total power variations contributes strongly however as the effect of the reflection is a total power to polarization conversion .",
    "thus the atmospheric @xmath7 becomes a polarization @xmath7 term which does not get removed by any modulation strategy .",
    "a straightforward differencing strategy , for example differencing successive samples during azimuthal scanning , or differencing two adjacent detectors , to remove this varying atmospheric contribution is likely to be the most efficient method , but would reduce the effective observing time by a factor of two .      the resistivity of aluminium varies with temperature , and so the induced polarization will vary with temperature .",
    "given a resistivity at room temperature of @xmath83 , the difference between the two polarization reflection coefficients is 0.075% .",
    "we introduce a temperature coefficient of resistance , @xmath84 , of @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .",
    "varying the temperature by 20@xmath36c gives a difference of 0.078% between the two polarization reflection coefficients , meaning that the t @xmath80 q , u mixing varies by @xmath87% .",
    "for a reasonably large flat fold mirror  in this case the flat is @xmath88 m diameter  the temperature variation is likely to be on the timescale of hours , driven largely by the ambient temperature variations .",
    "such variations should be removable by fitting the resistivity to the data over different timescales on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "we note that , apart from the pixel on the optical axis , each pixel will see a section of the mirror whose location varies in a predictable way with azimuth ( and elevation ) and so fitting with respect to mirror position might also be required . in this case",
    ", the error on the fit can be reduced by fitting multiple pixel data simulatiously to produce a mirror resistivity map .",
    "the polarizing effect of the fold mirror comes from its resistivity . as such , effects that alter the resistivity alter the polarizing effect .",
    "aluminium grows an oxide layer very quickly , which then hydrates .",
    "the hydrated aluminium oxide can then be degraded chemically , or by physical damage to the surface .",
    "such a surface is thin ( 5 - 15 nm ) and so does not change the resistivity by a large amount .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume that there will be changes to the surface during an extended observing campaign , both with oxide thickness and additional surface contamination . as with the temperature variation , contamination",
    "would almost certainly be localised , and so fitting resistivity with respect to mirror position would probably be required .",
    "however such changes would be expected to be slow ( timescales of days or more ) , or at least sudden and stable , and so more data is available to fit out the effect . as a result , we expect the resistivity variation from surface oxidation and contamination to be better characterised than the temperature variation .",
    "the work so far has assumed that the light incident on the flat - fold mirror is polarized at a very low level , and that the majority of the polarized signal comes from the flat - fold mirror .",
    "this is the case when considering the cmb only , where the polarization signal has zero mean .",
    "these assumptions do not hold , however , when observing an arbitrary patch of sky , where both synchrotron and dust from the galaxy is expected to be polarized at the @xmath89% level , with a total intensity of 10100 @xmath78k close to the galactic plane , but down to @xmath90k at high galactic latitudes .",
    "as such , we would recommend this method only be used in regions of known low foreground emission , where the resulting error in polarization reconstruction would be small .",
    "over sufficiently large areas of sky the magnitude of the effect could be modelled , and in regions with relatively little large - scale variation in the foreground emission , the effect would be a constant offset , similar to an additional absolute calibration error .",
    "the areas of sky observed by most b - mode experiments are selected to meet these requirements .    in order to test this , we re - ran the simulation with some fiducial dust and synchrotron models added .",
    "after applying the same method as discussed above , the map - plane residuals are large ; we see residuals of + 20 to -40 @xmath78k in the q map , in comparison with the signal level of @xmath91k across the map .",
    "we leave fully developing this method to work in the presence of significant polarized foregrounds for future work .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of a flat - fold mirror on polarization measurements of the cmb . in the case of no foregrounds and no noise with no corrections ,",
    "we find that the e and b spectra are heavily contaminated by the mixing of total power to polarization signal . however , as the cmb is expected to have a net polarization of zero , the effect can be fitted out . in the case of having a net polarization , such as in a real observation of the sky ,",
    "the reconstructed maps contain significant residuals .    , l.  f. and wise , m.  b. ( 1984 ) . .",
