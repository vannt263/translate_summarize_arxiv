    "in their famous paper of 1935 @xcite , einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "their argument was based on the premise of no action at a distance ( locality ) and realism .",
    "several years later bell @xcite showed that the prediction of qm are incompatible with the premises of local realism ( or local hidden variable theories ) .",
    "experiments @xcite based on bell s result support qm , indicating the failure of local hidden variable theories .",
    "quantitative tests used mainly bohm s ( dichotomic ) version @xcite of the epr entangled states instead of the original epr states with continuous degrees of freedom .    in recent years , systems with continuous",
    "variable has attracted much atttention in connection with the burgeoning field of quantum information @xcite . in such a field epr entanglement and quantum nonlocality",
    "are of practical importance .",
    "nevertheless , the generalization of bell s inequalities to quantum systems with continuous variabbles still remains a challenging issue .    in continuous variable bipartite quantum systems ,",
    "epr aspects can arise when trying to infer quadratures of one subsystem from those of the other @xcite .",
    "these can be tested by exploiting the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "such approach has been employed in refs.@xcite .",
    "few other theoretical proposals use the field quadrature measurements @xcite , while a phase space approach to quantum nonlocality has been developed @xcite and tested @xcite .    on the other hand quantum tomography @xcite",
    "provides a useful tool to reach a complete state knowledge .",
    "such knowledge could then be used for nonlocal tests .",
    "some aspects of epr problem have been considered in tomographic approach in @xcite .    here , we propose to use the tomographic data to do nonlocal tests . at first instance",
    ", we shall develop an inequality based on the tomograms .",
    "however , this will result quite difficult to violate .",
    "a state does not have to violate all possible bell s inequalities to be considered quantum nonlocal ; rather , a given state is nonlocal when it violates any bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "thus the degree of quantum nonlocality that we can uncover crucially depends not only on the given quantum state , but also on the bell operator @xcite .",
    "then , we shall introduce pseudospin operators whose statistics can be inferred from the data characterizing the reconstructed state , thus giving the possibility to use standard bell s inequalities .",
    "we shall also present some illuminating examples .",
    "a quantum state is described by the density operator @xmath0 or by any its phase space representation like the wigner function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are canonical conjugate variables .",
    "quantum tomography is a technique which allows to recover the quantum state from a set of measured probability distributions .",
    "the latter , sometimes called tomograms , are line projections of the wigner function .",
    "such projections can be parametrized through a symplectic transform @xcite .",
    "practically , the tomograms can be expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , are the parameters of the symplectic transformation and @xmath6 is a stochastic variable .",
    "it represents the random outcomes of the measurement of the observable @xmath7 , and @xmath8 results the probability distribution associated to such observable .",
    "it is worth noting that the above symplectic transformation , once thought as composition of rotations and squeezing , can be realized in optical systems @xcite .",
    "a remarkable property of the tomograms ( [ eq : ww ] ) is their homogeneity .    to get the phase space picture of the quantum state one has to invert the relation ( [ eq : ww ] ) , obtaining @xmath9",
    "this simply results an inverse fourier transform .",
    "neverthless , it becomes a more involved inverse transform , namely an inverse radon transform , when reducing the symplectic transformation to a mere rotation , i.e. , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this is the case of optical homodyne tomography ( oht ) .    by expanding the density operator in terms of a complete set of operators",
    ", it is also be possible to directly relate the quantum state to the tomograms , that is @xmath12 where the kernel operator takes the form @xmath13 here , @xmath14 can be set equal to unity ; this freedom reflects the overcompleteness of the information obtainable by means of all possible tomograms ( [ eq : ww ] ) .    in oht",
    "it is preferable to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhow ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ww ] ) since the kernel in the latter case is unbounded , thus requiring the use of an artificial cutoff to directly sample the wigner function . on the contrary , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhow ] ) allows a direct sample of the density matrix elements on the basis where @xmath15 results bounded @xcite .",
    "the above arguments can be generalized to the case of a bipartite two - mode system @xcite .",
    "in such a case the tomograms will be given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are parameters .",
    "let us restrict to the case of oht , and suppose to perform homodyne detection in both subsystems @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the rotation angles related to the local oscillators phase . as a consequence we have @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "we now classify the results of the measurements to be @xmath31 if the quadrature result @xmath6 is greater than zero , and @xmath32 otherwise @xcite .",
    "then , we can construct the following probabilities from the tomograms @xmath33 then , the bell s inequalities can be written in terms of the above probabilities . in particular , the chsh inequality @xcite can be written as @xmath34 where now @xmath35",
    "as discussed in section 2 , measuring tomograms allows to statistically sample the density matrix elements at least in some basis , e.g. fock basis .",
    "this represents a complete knowledge of the state , also for a bipartite system .",
    "then , such information , say the density matrix elements in fock basis , can be used to derive the statistics of any hermitian operator , even if this is not directly measurable .",
    "the price one has to pay is the large amount of data needs to collect .",
    "let us now see how these arguments can be fruitful applied to the problem of quantum nonlocality .",
    "we introduce the local pseudo - spin operators @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fock states .",
    "the operators ( [ eq : s ] ) obey the commutation relation of spin-@xmath39 algebra , namely @xmath40      = 2\\,i\\,\\delta_{j , j'}\\;\\varepsilon_{xyz}\\,s_{z}^{(j)}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 the totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "spin tomography approach was considered e.g. in @xcite .    in terms of the operators ( [ eq : s ] )",
    "the chsh inequality @xcite reads in its standard form , that is @xmath42 with @xmath43 here @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 are unit vectors in @xmath48 , while @xmath49 and the dot indicates the ordinary scalar product in @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , the angle brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cale ] ) denote the average over the density matrix elements assumed available from tomographic reconstruction .",
    "let us now study the possible violations of inequality ( [ eq : calb ] ) for the two preceeding examples .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the directions @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 coplanar , in the plane @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the relative angle betweeen @xmath44 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath54 .",
    "let us going to study the possible violations of the inequalities ( [ eq : bdef ] ) and ( [ eq : cale ] ) in three paradigmatic cases .",
    "we first consider the two - mode squeezed vacuum state which can be generated in the non - degenerate optical parametric amplifier @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "such state can also be described by the following wigner function @xmath58 \\bigr .",

    "[ fig1a ] we show the behavior of the functions ( [ eqs : wppepr])-([eqs : wpmepr ] ) vs @xmath66 for different values of @xmath14 .",

    "( [ eq : edef ] ) , will be always confined between @xmath21 and @xmath69 . in turns , the inequality ( [ eq : bdef ] )",
    "will be never violated .",
    "this results seems in agreement with bell s conclusions stating that the original epr state does not exhibit nonlocality because its wigner function is positive everywhere , and as such allows a hidden variable description @xcite .",

    "indeed a maximal violation of inequality ( [ eq : calb ] ) is achieved for @xmath72 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "as second example we consider the entangled superposition @xmath73 since @xmath74 and @xmath75 are orthogonal for @xmath76 , the state ( [ eq : psin ] ) resembles a spin triplet state .",

    "[ fig2b ] we show @xmath71 for the case of @xmath86 .",
