    "dynamical friction refers to momentum loss suffered by a massive object moving through a background medium due to its gravitational interaction with its own induced wake .",
    "the gravitational drag force removes angular momentum from an object in orbital motion , causing it to gradually spiral in toward the center of the orbit . in a pioneering study , @xcite derived the classical formula of dynamical friction in a uniform collisionless background , the result of which has been applied to a number of astronomical systems .",
    "examples include orbital decay of satellite galaxies orbiting their host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , dynamical fates of globular clusters near the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ) , galaxy formation within the framework of hierarchical clustering scenario ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , formation of kuiper - belt binaries @xcite , and planet migrations @xcite via interactions with planetesimals , etc .",
    "although less well recognized , dynamical friction also operates in gaseous backgrounds . using a time - dependent linear perturbation theory , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter o99 ) derived the analytic expressions for the density wake and drag force for a perturber in a uniform gaseous medium .",
    "o99 showed that resonant interactions between a perturber and pressure waves make the gaseous drag more efficient than the collisionless drag when the mach number @xmath3 .",
    "she also found that even a subsonic perturber experiences a nonvanishing gaseous drag if interaction time between the perturber and the background is finite .",
    "this is an improvement on the previous notion that the gaseous drag is absent for subsonic perturbers because of the front - back symmetry in the steady - state density wake @xcite .",
    "the results of o99 were confirmed numerically by @xcite and have been applied to various situations including massive black hole mergers in galactic nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) , orbital decay of compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) and associated viscous heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) in accretion disks , and heating of an intracluster medium by supersonically moving galaxies in clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . without involving shocks , density wakes in a collisionless medium",
    "are distributed more smoothly and achieve larger amplitudes than those in a gaseous medium @xcite , which led @xcite to suggest that x - ray emissions from galaxy wakes can in principle be used to discern the collisional character of dark matter in galaxy clusters .    while the results of @xcite and o99 are simple and provide good physical insights , they apply strictly to a mass traveling on a straight - line trajectory through an infinite homogeneous background .",
    "real astronomical systems obviously have nonuniform density distributions and perturbers tend to follow curvilinear orbits .",
    "for instance , motions of galaxies in galaxy clusters , binary black holes near the central parts of galaxies , and compact stars in accretion disks are better approximated by near - circular than straight - line orbits , and their background media usually in hydrostatic equilibrium are stratified in the radial direction . even for objects experiencing orbital decay ,",
    "a near - circular orbit is a good approximation if the associated friction time is longer than the orbital time .",
    "consideration of a circular - orbit perturber is of particular interest since it will allow the perturber , if supersonic , to overtake the backside of its wake that was created about an orbital period earlier . in this case , a steady - state wake that eventually forms has morphology and drag force that might be significantly different from the linear - trajectory counterparts .",
    "numerical simulations carried out by @xcite and @xcite indeed show that the density wake by a near - circular orbit perturber contains a trailing spiral tail , which is absent in the linear - trajectory cases .",
    "they also showed that the resulting drag force is smaller than the estimate based on the formula given in o99 , which is probably due to the near - circular orbit , although the effect of nonuniform backgrounds in their models can not be ignored completely .",
    "the drag formula based on perturbers moving straight in either a collisionless medium or a gaseous medium depends on the coulomb logarithm @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the cutoff radii introduced to avoid a divergence of the force integrals . through a gaseous medium , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes time elapsed since the perturber was introduced ( o99 ) . ] while many previous studies conventionally adopted @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the characteristic sizes of the perturber and the background medium , respectively , the choice of @xmath6 remains somewhat ambiguous for objects moving on near - circular orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for _ collisionless _ backgrounds ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed n - body experiments for orbital evolution of satellite galaxies in a spherical halo , and found that the coulomb logarithm with @xmath6 varying proportionally to the orbital radius rather than fixed to the system size gives better fits to their numerical results ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we shall show in the present work that a similar modification of the coulomb logarithm is necessary in order to apply the results of o99 to perturbers on near - circular orbits in _ gaseous _ backgrounds , as well .    in this paper , we consider a perturber moving on a circular orbit in a uniform gaseous medium .",
    "using a linear semi - analytic approach , we explore the structure of the density wake , evaluate the drag force on the perturber , and compare them with those in the straight - line trajectory cases . in  2 , we revisit the linear perturbation analysis of o99 for the perturbed density response and apply it to the case of a circular - orbit perturber .",
    "we solve the resulting equations numerically . in  3 , we present the numerical results for the wakes and drag forces with varying mach number .",
    "we provide simple fitting expressions to the numerical results , and show that ostriker s formula still gives a good estimate for the drag force on a circular - orbit perturber only if the outer cutoff radius in the coulomb logarithm is taken equal to the orbital diameter of the perturber . in  4 , we summarize the present work and briefly discuss our finding .",
    "we consider the response of gas to a point - mass perturber moving on a circular orbit and calculate the resulting gravitational drag force on the perturber .",
    "we treat the gas as an inviscid , adiabatic fluid , and do not consider the effects of magnetic fields as well as gaseous self - gravity .",
    "the governing equations for ideal hydrodynamics are @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gravitational potential of the perturber .",
    "other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "following o99 , we consider an initially uniform gaseous medium with density @xmath12 . assuming that the wake induced by the perturber remains at small amplitudes , we linearize equations ( [ eq : con ] ) and ( [ eq : mom ] ) using @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the adiabatic speed of sound in the unperturbed medium and @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the dimensionless density and velocity perturbations , respectively . eliminating @xmath17 from the linearized equations , one obtains a three - dimensional wave equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the mass density of the perturber . the formal solution to equation ( [ eq : wave ] ) based on the the retarded green function technique",

    "o99 solved equation ( [ eq : formal ] ) directly to obtain an expression for the perturbed density .",
    "the same result was found by @xcite who independently used a fourier transform method in both space and time variables .",
    "we now concentrate on the case where a point - mass perturber with mass @xmath21 moves on a circular orbit with a fixed orbital radius @xmath2 and a constant velocity @xmath1 in an otherwise uniform gaseous medium ; the angular speed of the perturber is @xmath22 .",

    "] , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the mach number of the perturber . in equation ( [ eq : dist ] ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ sketch ] schematically illustrates the situation at the orbital plane and the meanings of variables used in equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) . at time @xmath8 , the perturber is located at @xmath40 . during its journey along the thick curve ,",
    "the perturber continuously launches sound waves that propagate into the background gaseous medium .",
    "the position @xmath41 denotes a region of interest in the surrounding gas where the density response will be evaluated .",
    "since the sound waves have finite traveling time , only the signals emitted by the perturber at the location(s ) @xmath42 at the retarded time @xmath43 are able to affect the point @xmath44 at time @xmath8 .",

    "the symbol @xmath48 in equation ( [ eq : dist ] ) refers to the three - dimensional linear distance between @xmath47 and @xmath44 normalized by @xmath2 .    using the identity @xmath49=\\sum_i\\delta(w - w_i)/\\vert f'(w_i)\\vert$ ] , where @xmath50",

    "the function @xmath57 $ ] in equation ( [ eq : d ] ) defines the region of influence ( or casual region ) outside of which sonic perturbations sent off by the perturber at @xmath28 have insufficient time to reach . for @xmath58 , equation ( [ eq : w ] ) yields @xmath59 , so that the region of influence corresponds roughly to a sphere with radius @xmath60 centered at the orbital center .",
    "appendix [ sec : limit ] presents limiting solutions of equation ( [ eq : d ] ) near the perturber .",
    "since @xmath48 is a periodic function of @xmath45 with period 2@xmath61 , equation ( [ eq : w ] ) has at least one real root and may possess multiple roots for @xmath50 depending on the values of @xmath62 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath35 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : wi ] , we describe how the number of solutions of equation ( [ eq : w ] ) vary with the mach number of a perturber . it turns out that there is only a single root for @xmath50 everywhere for a subsonic , circular - orbit perturber , which is the same as in the straight - line trajectory case ( o99 ) .",
    "when a circular - orbit perturber moves at a supersonic speed , however , equation ( [ eq : w ] ) has an odd number of roots that contribute to the wake in a steady state , which is distinct from the straight - line trajectory case where only one or two points along the orbit influence the wake .",
    "once the gravitational wake @xmath63 is found , it is straightforward to evaluate the drag force exerted on the perturber : @xmath64 in the straight - line trajectory case studied by o99 , @xmath65 always remains cylindrically symmetric with respect to the line of motion , resulting in the drag force in the anti - parallel direction .",
    "when the perturber is on a circular orbit , @xmath65 loses the cylindrical symmetry and instead becomes symmetric relative to the orbital plane , making the vertical component of @xmath66 vanish .",
    "we decompose the nonvanishing parts into the radial and azimuthal components : @xmath67 where    [ eq : i ] @xmath68 and @xmath69    note that @xmath70 measures the drag force along the lateral direction of the instantaneous perturber motion , while @xmath71 is for the backward direction .",
    "the dimensional term @xmath72 in equation ( [ eq : fdf ] ) allows to directly compare @xmath70 and @xmath71 with the linear - trajectory counterparts ( see eq .",
    "[ 12 ] of o99 ) .",
    "as we shall show in  [ sec : sum ] , it is the azimuthal drag @xmath71 that is responsible for the orbital decay of a perturber .",
    "we solve equations ( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) numerically to find the perturbed density distribution @xmath73 for given @xmath62 and @xmath8 .",
    "we first construct a three - dimensional cartesian mesh centered at the center of the orbit , and solve equation ( [ eq : w ] ) for @xmath50 at each grid point using a hybrid newton - bisection method . by checking the conditions for multiple roots discussed in appendix [ sec : wi ] ,",
    "we ensure that we do not miss any solution for @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding drag forces @xmath74 and @xmath75 are calculated by direct integration of equations ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "since the density wake often exhibits sharp discontinuities especially for supersonic perturbers and is distributed over a large spatial range , it is important to check that the drag forces we calculate do not depend on the size of the computational box and its resolution . for fixed @xmath62",
    ", we repeated the calculations with varying box size and resolution and found that depending on the mach number , the box size of @xmath76 and resolution of @xmath77 grids per @xmath78 are sufficient to guarantee good convergence of the drag forces .",
    "although the density perturbations are non - zero outside the box , they have very low amplitudes and are located far from the perturber , providing a negligible contribution to the drag .",
    "very high resolution calculations are required for mach numbers near the critical values @xmath79 , in which cases the wake tails become thin and dense ( see appendix [ sec : wi ] ) .",
    "we begin by illustrating temporal evolution of density perturbations induced by a supersonic perturber .",
    "figure [ evolution ] shows snapshots of the density wake and the corresponding number of roots of equation ( [ eq : w ] ) at the orbital plane for @xmath80 .",
    "time is expressed in units of @xmath2/@xmath15 .",
    "the black circle represents the orbit of a perturber which , introduced at @xmath81 initially , moves in the counterclockwise direction . at early time ( @xmath82 ) , the density wake consists of a mach cone and a sonic sphere that are curved along the orbit .",
    "except the bending , the overall wake structure , not to mention the number of solutions for @xmath50 which is either one or two inside the casual region , is the same as in the straight - line trajectory case of o99 . as the wake bends further ,",
    "the mach cone and the sonic sphere become folded at the innermost interface , creating high - density regions near the center ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the wake expands with time at a sonic speed and the mach cone becomes elongated further .",
    "unlike in the case of a straight - line trajectory where the mach cone and the sonic sphere never interact with each other , the perturber ( and the head of the mach cone ) on a circular orbit is able to enter its own wake , providing additional perturbations for some regions inside the sonic sphere .",
    "alternatively , this can be viewed as the sonic sphere whose center lies at the initial position of the perturber expands radially outward , swallowing a part of the elongated mach cone .",
    "consequently , the overlapping of the mach cone and the sonic sphere creates a high - density trailing tail that has received perturbations three times from the perturber ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "figure [ evolution ] shows that immediate outside the sonic sphere , there still exists a region of the undisturbed mach cone with two @xmath50 s .",
    "as time proceeds , however , this region moves away from the perturber and thus gives an increasingly small contribution to the drag force . in a steady state which is attained at @xmath85 ,",
    "the entire domain is affected either once or three times by the perturber .",
    "figure [ steadym20 ] displays the steady - state distributions of the density wake for @xmath80 on the @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath34 planes , which clearly shows that the trailing tail loosely wraps around the perturber . the tail becomes narrower with increasing @xmath88 .",
    "a close inspection of the tail at the @xmath34 plane shows that density becomes smaller away from the perturber along the tail and is largest at the edges across the tail .",
    "this is similar to the density distribution inside the mach cone in the linear trajectory case where diverging flows ( and reduced gravitational potential ) after the shock cause density to decrease away from the shock front ( and the perturber ) .",
    "this suggests that the edges of the tail are shock fronts .",
    "the outer edge of the tail shown in figure [ steadym20 ] that connects smoothly all the way to the perturber corresponds indeed to the surface of the curved mach cone ( see also fig .  [ sketch ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the inner edge of the tail traces the interface between the mach cone and the sonic sphere that is newly swept up by the expanding sonic sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ evolution ] ) .",
    "appendix [ sec : angle ] proves that the half - opening angle of the head of the curved mach cone in the @xmath34 plane is equal to @xmath89 , entirely consistent with the case of a linear trajectory .    the wake tail becomes thicker as @xmath62 increases from unity .",
    "figure [ overlap ] shows the steady - state density wakes as well as the number of @xmath50 s that contribute to @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 at the @xmath34 plane . in both panels ,",
    "the perturber moving in the counterclockwise direction is located at @xmath93 when @xmath91 , the tail is fat enough to cover most of the space except near the center and a narrow lane between the tail edges . at @xmath94 ,",
    "the inner edge of the tail eventually touches the neighboring outer edge , enabling three @xmath50 for the entire region under the conditions expressed by equation ( [ eq : ncond ] ) .",
    "when the mach number is slightly larger than @xmath95 , the tail overlaps itself .",
    "this in turn creates a new tail with five @xmath50 s , as figure [ overlap]__b _ _ displays .",
    "as @xmath62 increases further , the new tail again becomes thicker , starts to overlap at @xmath96 , and produces a narrow lane with seven @xmath50 s when @xmath97 .",
    "the same pattern repeats with increasing @xmath62 , and equation ( [ eq : m ] ) determines the critical mach numbers .      unlike in the supersonic cases where a perturber can overtake its own wake and",
    "create a tail with complicated structure , sonic perturbations generated by a subsonic perturber produce a gravitational wake that is spatially smooth and does not involve a shock . since perturbations propagate faster than a perturber with @xmath98 , the whole casual region is affected by a perturber just once , corresponding to a single @xmath50 at any position .",
    "figure [ steadym05 ] shows the slices of the perturbed density for @xmath99 in the @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath34 planes when a steady state is reached .",
    "again , the perturber is located at @xmath86 , @xmath100 .",
    "the density structure in the @xmath34 plane is simply a curved version of what a linear - trajectory perturber would produce .",
    "in particular , as appendix [ sec : limit ] shows , the iso - density surfaces near the perturber have the shapes of oblate spheroids with ellipticity @xmath101 , with the short axis parallel to the direction of the motion of the perturber , a characteristic feature of a subsonic wake created by a linear - trajectory perturber ( o99 ) .",
    "notice , however , that the bending of wakes in circular - orbit cases makes the perturbed density distributions intrinsically asymmetric .",
    "this results in nonvanishing drag forces even in a steady state , and the dominant contribution to the drag comes from high - density regions near the perturber .",
    "this is markedly different from the purely steady - state linear - trajectory cases where a subsonic perturber experiences no drag due to the front - back symmetry of a wake about the perturber ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "even if the finite interaction time between the straight - line perturber and the background gas is considered , regions with symmetric perturbed density close to the perturber exert zero net force ( o99 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting drag force in the backward direction of motion on a circular - orbit perturber is almost the same as that in the linear - trajectory cases , as we will show in the next subsection . compared with supersonic cases ,",
    "the tail in a subsonic wake is short , loosely wound , and very weak , suggesting that its contribution to the drag force is negligible .",
    "as sonic perturbations launched from a perturber at @xmath28 propagate radially outward , the volume of space exerting the gravitational drag on the perturber grows with time .",
    "figure [ time ] plots the drag force as functions of time for a few chosen mach numbers .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are for @xmath75 and @xmath74 , respectively . since @xmath73 is singular at @xmath102 , only the region with @xmath103",
    "is taken into account in force computation , where @xmath104 is the three - dimensional distance measured from the perturber ; the dependence on @xmath5 will be checked below .",
    "the drag force on a subsonic perturber increases almost linearly with time before turning abruptly to a constant value , whereas a supersonic wake with a high - density tail gives rise to slow fluctuations in the drag at early time . at any event , both components of the drag force converge to respective steady - state values , typically within the sound crossing time over the distance equal to the orbital diameter or within about an orbital period when @xmath62 is of order unity .",
    "the primary reason for this is of course because the perturbed density decreases quite rapidly with @xmath104 and also because gravity is an inverse - square force .",
    "this is unlike the case of a straight - line trajectory where the drag increases secularly as @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "the fast convergence of the drag force guarantees that one can use the steady - state values of @xmath75 and @xmath74 for all practical purposes .",
    "next , we check the dependence of the drag force on @xmath107 .",
    "figure [ rmin ] shows the results for @xmath99 , 2.0 , and 4.0 .",
    "the sizes of errorbars associated with finite grid resolution are smaller than the radius of a solid circle at each data point .",
    "first of all , the drag force , @xmath74 , in the radial direction converges to a constant value as @xmath5 decreases for both subsonic and supersonic cases .",
    "on the other hand , the drag force , @xmath75 , in the opposite direction of the orbital motion , varies as @xmath108 with decreasing @xmath5 for supersonic perturbers , while independent of @xmath5 for subsonic perturbers .",
    "this dependence of @xmath75 on small @xmath5 for circular - orbit perturbers is exactly the same as in the linear trajectory cases , which makes sense because the curvature of a circular orbit is almost negligible in a tiny volume near the perturber .",
    "we plot in figure [ forces ] the steady - state drag forces for a circular - orbit perturber as functions of the mach number .",
    "for all the points , @xmath109 is taken and numerical convergence is checked .",
    "filled circles give @xmath110 , while open circles are for @xmath111 , which can be compared with figure 3 of o99 .",
    "for practical use , we fit the data using @xmath112 ,                                         & \\textrm{for}&1.1\\leq&{\\mathcal{m}}&<4.4,\\\\      0.3\\ { \\mathcal{m}}^2 ,                        & \\textrm{for}&4.4\\leq&{\\mathcal{m } } ,    \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath113 ,                        & \\textrm{for}&1.0\\leq&{\\mathcal{m}}&<4.4 , \\\\",

    "the fits are within 4% of our semi - analytic results for @xmath114 and within 16% for @xmath115",
    ". both components of the drag force peak at @xmath116 , analogous to the linear - trajectory cases , and @xmath75 dominates over @xmath74 for transonic perturbers .",
    "although @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 for @xmath117 , its effect on orbital decay of a perturber is insignificant ( see  [ sec : sum ] ) .",
    "the local bumps in the drag forces at @xmath118 and 7.8 are due to the self - overlapping of a wake tail explained in  [ sec : superwake ] .",
    "figure [ forces ] also plots as dotted curves the results of o99 for drag force on linear - trajectory perturbers . despite the difference in the shape of the orbits ,",
    "the agreement between @xmath75 and ostriker s formula is excellent for the subsonic case .",
    "this presumably reflects the fact that other than bending , the wake structure created by a subsonic circular - orbit perturber is not significantly different from the linear - trajectory counterpart ( see  [ sec : subwake ] ) .",
    "note also that ostriker s formula for the supersonic case , for which @xmath119 is adopted to fit our numerical results , is overall in good agreement with @xmath75 for a range of @xmath62 .",
    "it is remarkable that the subsonic and supersonic drag formulae ( with @xmath120 chosen adequately in supersonic cases ) obtained from perturbers moving straight still give a reasonably good estimate for the drag even on circular - orbit perturbers .",
    "we have taken a semi - analytic approach to study the gravitational wake and the associated drag force on a perturber moving on a circular orbit in an infinite , uniform gaseous medium .",
    "this work extends @xcite who studied the cases with straight - line trajectory perturbers .",
    "the circular orbit generally causes the wake to bend along the orbit and creates a trailing tail . for a subsonic perturber",
    ", the density wake has a weak tail and is distributed quite smoothly ( see fig .",
    "[ steadym05 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", a supersonic perturber can catch up with its own wake , possibly multiple times depending on the mach number , forming a very pronounced trailing tail across which density changes abruptly ( see fig .  [ steadym20 ] ) .",
    "although the region influenced by the perturber keeps expanding with time into the surrounding medium , the drag force promptly saturates to a steady state value within less than the crossing time of sound waves over the distance equal to the orbital diameter .",
    "because of asymmetry in the density wake , it is desirable to decompose the drag force into two components : @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the radial and azimuthal directions , respectively ( eq .  [ [ eq : fdf ] ] ) . figure [ forces ] plots our main results for @xmath74 and @xmath75 as functions of the mach number @xmath62 ; equations ( [ eq : ir ] ) and ( [ eq : iphi ] ) give the algebraic fits to the numerical results . the azimuthal drag force varying rather steeply with @xmath62 peaks at @xmath121 , while the radial force is highly suppressed at @xmath98 and exceeds the azimuthal drag at @xmath117 .",
    "it is remarkable that the drag on linear - trajectory perturbers given in o99 is almost identical to @xmath75 for subsonic cases , and gives a good approximation for supersonic cases , too , provided @xmath122 .",
    "a striking feature in gravitational wakes formed by circular - orbit perturbers is a long tail in a trailing spiral shape .",
    "such a tail structure is indeed commonly seen in recent hydrodynamic simulations for black hole mergers in a gaseous medium ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . albeit much weaker , it is also apparent in n - body simulations for satellite orbital decay in a collisionless background ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for supersonic perturbers ,",
    "the tail is a curved mach cone and bounded by the shock fronts that propagate radially outward . as explained in appendices [ sec : wi ] and [ sec : angle ] , the outer edge of the tail is described by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are defined through equation ( [ eq : wy ] ) . by taking a time derivative of this equation for fixed @xmath24 , one can show that the propagation speed @xmath126 of the spiral tail in the radial direction is given by @xmath127 for @xmath128 . clearly , @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and @xmath131 near @xmath132 as equation ( [ eq : half ] ) implies .",
    "this prediction is roughly consistent with @xcite who empirically found that the tail in a model with @xmath133 has an average propagation speed of @xmath134 .",
    "many previous studies on dynamical friction adopted the drag formula based on perturbers moving straight and estimated the coulomb logarithm by taking @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the system size ( see references in  1 ) . unlike a straight - line trajectory",
    ", a circular orbit naturally introduces a characteristic length scale , @xmath2 .",
    "the results of our semi - analytic analyses suggest that , at least in a gaseous medium , the drag force obtained for linear - trajectory perturbers can be a reasonable approximation to that for circular - orbit perturbers with the same mach number if @xmath137 is taken equal to @xmath138 . since @xmath139 in most relevant situations , using @xmath135 usually overestimates the drag force for objects in near - circular motion . from hydrodynamic simulations for orbital decay of perturbers in a stratified gaseous sphere , @xcite suggested @xmath140 with an identification @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the softening radius of the point - mass potential @xcite .",
    "this happens to be similar to our suggestion @xmath143 for the parameter range @xmath144 that they considered .",
    "our suggestion for the coulomb logarithm on near - circular orbit perturbers in a gaseous medium is also consistent with the common prescription for orbital decay of small satellites in collisionless backgrounds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that chandrasekhar s formula with @xmath145 $ ] gives excellent fits to the results of their n - body simulations .",
    "the discrepancy between our suggestion and their prescription may be attributable in part to the effects of collisionless nature , nonuniform background density , and self - gravity of particles in their models .",
    "density inhomogeneity in the background can also make significant changes to the classical drag force . for collisionless backgrounds",
    ", @xcite found that nonuniform density induces an additional drag force in the lateral direction of the perturber motion , taking up to 10% of the drag in the backward direction .",
    "they proposed the inverse of a local density gradient as an appropriate choice for @xmath6 in the coulomb logarithm ( see also @xcite ) , which was confirmed by @xcite who ran a number of numerical simulations for systems with a large central density concentration .",
    "hydrodynamic models in @xcite studied the combined effects of nonuniform backgrounds and curvilinear orbits on dynamical friction in a gaseous medium , although it is challenging to isolate each effect separately .    finally , as a heuristic example , we consider the dynamical friction of a galaxy on a near - circular orbit subject to the drag force given by equations ( [ eq : ir ] ) and ( [ eq : iphi ] ) due to an intracluster medium .",
    "the cluster is dominated by dark matter whose mass distribution follows the nfw profile with the characteristic mass @xmath146 and the scale radius @xmath147 kpc @xcite .",
    "the intracluster medium has a constant electron density @xmath148 and temperature 1 kev ; the corresponding adiabatic speed of sound is @xmath149 .",
    "initially , a galaxy with size @xmath150 kpc and mass @xmath151 including a dark halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) is orbiting at @xmath152 kpc with an equilibrium velocity @xmath153 about the cluster center .",
    "the equations of motion in the orbital plane are    [ eq : gal ] @xmath154 @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the nfw potential and dots represent derivatives with respect to time .",
    "figure [ orbitnfw ] plots the resulting temporal variations of the orbital radius of the galaxy .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the case with full @xmath74 and @xmath75 given by equations ( [ eq : ir ] ) and ( [ eq : iphi ] ) , while the dashed line is for a controlled case where @xmath74 is artificially taken to be zero . except for slight mismatches in phase , both",
    "agree fairly well with each other , demonstrating that the radial drag force does not have a serious impact on the orbital decay .",
    "as equation ( [ eq : gal ] ) implies , it is the azimuthal drag @xmath75 that takes away most of the orbital angular momentum from the galaxy ; the radial drag changes the orbital eccentricity more than the semi - major axis ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ orbitnfw ] also plots as dot - dashed line the decay of the orbital radius blindly using ostriker s formula with @xmath157 , corresponding to @xmath158 mpc .",
    "while the galaxy motion remains supersonic ( @xmath159 gyr ) , this value of the coulomb logarithm overestimates the realistic drag force , on average , by a factor of 1.7 and thus brings the galaxy to @xmath160 in 2 gyrs , which is about 2.3 times faster than the estimate based on the realistic drag force . on the other hand ,",
    "the result of using @xmath161 in the formula of o99 , shown as dotted line in figure [ orbitnfw ] , is in excellent agreement with those using equations ( [ eq : ir ] ) and ( [ eq : iphi ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates again that ostriker s formula with @xmath162 gives quite a good approximation to the drag force even in the case of a circular - orbit perturber .",

    "substituting equations ( [ eq : wthree ] ) into equation ( [ eq : d ] ) and taking the steady - state limit ( @xmath183 ) , we obtain @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : dss ] ) again represents the perturbed density in the linear trajectory case .",
    "the second term , albeit small compared with the first term for small @xmath186 , arises as the perturber on a circular orbit can overtake its wake .",
    "the effects of circular orbits are significant in regions away from the perturber , which is pursued numerically in  [ sec : res ] .",
    "to obtain the perturbed density @xmath73 at given time and location , it is crucial to find @xmath50 that satisfies equation ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "let us define @xmath187 for a fixed set of @xmath188 , and @xmath35 . then , finding solutions of equation ( [ eq : w ] ) is equivalent to finding the intersections of two curves @xmath189 and @xmath190 on the @xmath45  @xmath191 plane .",
    "since @xmath192 for all @xmath55 and @xmath56 , it is trivial to show that there is only one solution for all space and time if @xmath193 .",
    "this implies that any location inside the casual region for sound waves is influenced just once by a perturber moving at a subsonic speed .",
    "the same is true for a subsonic perturber moving on a straight - line trajectory studied by o99 .",
    "a necessary condition for having more than one root is @xmath194 for any @xmath45 , which after some algebra results in @xmath195 when the conditions ( [ eq : ncond ] ) are fulfilled , there are two tangent points of the curve @xmath190 to lines with a slope of @xmath196 in the range @xmath197 .",
    "let ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) and ( @xmath198 , @xmath199 ) denote the tangent points , such that @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "the tangent condition @xmath202 yields    [ eq : wy ] @xmath203    at the @xmath34 plane .",
    "note that the @xmath204 periodicity of @xmath190 ensures that ( @xmath205 , @xmath206 ) for arbitrary integer @xmath207 are also tangent points to a line with slope of @xmath196 .    for given @xmath106 ,",
    "the number of solutions of equation ( [ eq : w ] ) depends on the slopes of lines connecting the points @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "when the line passing through @xmath210 and @xmath209 has a slope larger than @xmath196 , which occurs for @xmath211 ( see below for the definition of @xmath79 with integer @xmath212 ) , the spatial regions that satisfy equations ( [ eq : ncond ] ) as well as @xmath213 have three roots for @xmath50 , while the other regions have only a single root .",
    "when @xmath214 , the slope of the line connecting @xmath215 and @xmath209 is greater than @xmath196 , so that the regions bounded by the condition @xmath216 possess five roots ; the other regions have three roots .",
    "note that the volume that does not satisfy conditions ( [ eq : ncond ] ) still has a single root . as the mach number increases further ,",
    "new regions emerge to have a larger ( odd ) number of roots for @xmath50 .",
    "generalizing the discussion given above , the critical mach number @xmath79 below which a steady - state wake possesses up to @xmath217 roots can be determined by the requirement @xmath218 . using equations ( [ eq : wy ] ) ,",
    "this is simplified to @xmath219 where we take @xmath220 without any loss of generality since the existence of multiple roots requires @xmath221 ( eq . [ [ eq : ncond ] ] ) .",
    "the first few solutions of equation ( [ eq : m ] ) are @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , etc .",
    "the presence of multiple roots implies that the density wake in those regions are constructed by a superposition of sonic signals that were emitted by the perturber at as many different locations ( and corresponding retarded times ) as the number of roots .",
    "the @xmath62-dependency of the number of roots for a circular - orbit supersonic perturber is in sharp contrast to the case of a straight - line trajectory where only one ( within a sonic sphere ) or two ( within a rear mach cone ) roots are allowed regardless of the mach number ( o99 ) . when a perturber is moving at a supersonic speed along a circular orbit , it is able to catch up with its own wake ( possibly multiple times ) , adding new sonic disturbances to the regions that were already disturbed by the perturber",
    ". regions of multiple roots usually take a form of a long trailing spiral , as exemplified in figures [ evolution ] , [ steadym20 ] , and [ overlap ] .",
    "although a mach cone is generally curved for a circular - orbit perturber , its half - opening angle in the vicinity of the perturber is the same as in the linear trajectory counterpart . as explained in ",
    "[ sec : superwake ] , the interior of a curved mach cone and an attached trailing tail is the region where equation ( [ eq : w ] ) has multiple roots in a steady state .",
    "it is bounded by @xmath225 curves in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath226 curve describes the inner and outer edges of the mach cone head near the perturber as well as the outer edge of the tail , represented by light solid curve and dashed curve at the boundaries of the shade region displayed in figure [ sketch ] . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath227 curve corresponds to the inner edge of the tail ( dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) that meets the mach cone head at @xmath228 . by taylor expanding @xmath124 and @xmath125 about @xmath229 in the @xmath34 plane and adding the resulting expressions together , one can show the head of the mach cone is described by @xmath230 up to the first order in @xmath231 .",
    "the negative sign in equation ( [ eq : half ] ) results since @xmath35 is measured in the counterclockwise direction from the perturber ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "let @xmath232 be the half - opening angle of the mach cone near the perturber .",
