    "string theory and m - theory describing gravity as a truly higher - dimensional interaction becoming effectively 4d at low - enough energies inspired studies of the braneworld models , where the observable universe is a 3-brane ( domain wall ) to which the standard model ( non - gravitational ) matter fields are confined , while gravity field enters the extra spatial dimensions the size of which may be much larger than the planck length scale @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "gravity can be localized near the brane at low energies even with a non - compact , infinite size extra dimension with the warped spacetime satisfying the 5d einstein equations with negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "significant deviations from the einstein gravity occur at very high energies in vicinity of compact objects ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the high - energy effects produced by the gravitational collapse are disconnected from the outside space by the horizon , but they could have a signature on the brane , influencing properties of black holes @xcite .",
    "there are high - energy effects of local character influencing pressure in collapsing matter the non - local corrections of \" back - reaction ",
    "character arise from the influence of the weyl curvature of the bulk space on the brane - the matter on the brane induces weyl curvature in the bulk which makes influence on the structures on the brane due to the bulk gravitation stresses @xcite .",
    "the combination of high - energy ( local ) and bulk stress ( non - local ) effects alters significantly the matching problem on the brane , as compared to the 4d einstein gravity ; for spherical objects , matching no longer leads to a schwarzchild exterior in general @xcite .",
    "the weyl stresses induced by bulk gravitons imply that the matching conditions do not have unique solution on the brane ; in fact , knowledge of the 5d weyl tensor is needed as a minimum condition for uniqueness @xcite .",
    "however , recently no exact 5d solution is known .",
    "assuming spherically symmetric metric induced on the 3-brane the effective gravitational field equations of vacuum type in both the brane and bulk can be solved , giving a reissner - nordstrm static black hole solutions endowed with a \" tidal  charge parameter @xmath1 @xcite , instead of the standard electric charge parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the tidal charge reflects the effects of the weyl curvature of the bulk space , i.e. , from the 5d gravitation stresses @xcite with bulk gravitation tidal effects giving the name of the charge .",
    "note that the tidal charge can be both positive and negative , and there are some indications that the negative tidal charge should properly represent the  back - reaction  effects of the bulk space weyl tensor on the @xcite    the stationary and axisymmetric solution of the constrained equations describing rotating black holes localized in the randall - sundrum braneworld were derived in @xcite .",
    "the solutions are determined by metric tensor of the kerr - newman form with a tidal charge describing the 5d correction term generated by the 5d weyl tensor stresses .",
    "the tidal charge has an `` electric '' character and arises due to the 5d gravitational coupling between the brane and the bulk , reflected on the brane through the `` electric '' part of the bulk weyl tensor @xcite , in analogy with the spherically symmetric black - hole case @xcite .",
    "when the electromagnetic field is introduced , the non - vacuum solutions of the effective einstein equations on the brane are much more complex in comparison with the standard kerr - newman solutions @xcite .    here",
    "we consider optical phenomena in the kerr - newman type of solutions describing the braneworld rotating ( kerr ) black holes with no electric charge , since in astrophysically relevant situations the electric charge of the black hole must be exactly zero , or very small @xcite .",
    "then the results obtained in analyzing the behavior of test particles and photons or test fields around the kerr - newman black holes could be used assuming both positive and negative values of the braneworld tidal parameter @xmath1 ( used instead of the charge parameter @xmath3 ) .",
    "the information on the properties of strong gravitational fields in vicinity of compact objects , namely of black holes , is encoded into optical phenomena of different kind that enable us to make estimates of the black hole parameters , including its tidal charge , when predictions of the theoretical models are confronted with the observed data . from this point of view",
    ", the spectral profiles of accretion discs around the black holes in galactic binaries , e.g. , in microquasars , are most promising @xcite , along with profiled spectral lines in the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "important information could also be obtained from the quasiperiodic oscillations observed in the x - ray flux of some low - mass black hole binaries of galactic origin @xcite , some expected intermediate black hole sources @xcite , or those observed in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the most promising orbital resonance model then enables relative exact measurement of the black hole parameters @xcite that should be confronted with the predictions of the optical modelling @xcite . in the case of our galaxy centre black hole sgr a@xmath4 , we could be able to measure the detailed optical phenomena , as compared with the other sources , since it is the nearest supermassive black hole with mass estimated to be @xmath5 @xcite , enabling us to measure the \" silhouette  of the black hole and other subtle gr phenomena in both weak and strong field limits @xcite .",
    "here we present an introductory study on the role of the braneworld tidal charge parameter in the optical phenomena related to profiled spectral lines generated by thin radiating tori in the braneworld kerr black - hole backgrounds .",
    "of course , for @xmath0 , the results hold as well for standard kerr - newman spacetimes due to the correspondence @xmath6 with @xmath3 being the squared charge parameter of the kerr - newman black hole .",
    "we use here the transfer function method @xcite which seems to be the most appropriate in our problem . in section 2 ,",
    "the geometry and photon equations of motion are given .",
    "in section 3 , the geodetic al circular orbits in the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetimes with a tidal charge are presented . in section 4 ,",
    "the specific energy flux of photons is given and optical phenomena related to the thin ring of radiating particles are discussed , namely the frequency shift and the focusing . in section 5",
    ", the profiled spectral lines are calculated using the transfer function method and assuming isotropically radiating sources with photon energy fixed to @xmath7 in the rest frame of the radiating source .",
    "the line profiles are determined in dependence on the viewing angle @xmath8 and the ring radius @xmath9 , which is assumed to be located in the inner part of a thin accretion disc .",
    "specially , it is assumed near marginally stable orbit @xmath10 and in the orbit corresponding to the resonance radius @xmath11 where the ratio of vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies is @xmath12 , corresponding to the qpos frequency ratios commonly observed in microquasars @xcite . in section 6 , concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the solution of vacuum effective einstein equations on the brane has been for rotating black holes given in @xcite .",
    "it is not an exact metric satisfying the full system of the 5d equations ( which is not known recently ) , but a consistent solution of constraint equations with a specialized metric form on the brane .",
    "in such a framework it represents the only useful rotating black hole solution reflecting the influence of the extra - dimensions by a single parameter called braneworld tidal charge because of expressing the tidal effects of the bulk @xcite .",
    "the properties of the circular motion in braneworld kerr spacetimes were discussed in @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize the relevant results .",
    "the 5d einstein equations in the bulk spacetime have the form @xcite",
    "@xmath13    where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the gravitational constant ) , @xmath16 is the bulk cosmological constant ( assuming anti - de sitter geometry ) , @xmath17 is the energy - momentum tensor in the bulk , @xmath18is the energy - momentum tensor on the brane , @xmath19 and @xmath20 being metric determinants of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the bulk spacetime is expressed in the form @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the unit vector orthogonal to the brane and @xmath25 represents local frame of four - vectors ; the induced metric on the brane    @xmath26    the effective einstein gravitational equations ( ege ) on the brane could then be given by using the israel junction method generalized to 5d situation .",
    "the gravitational field equations on the brane take the form @xcite",
    "@xmath27    the traceless tensor    @xmath28    is constructed from the \" electric  part of the bulk riemann tensor    @xmath29    the cosmological constant on the brane    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    is the normal compressive pressure term in the 5d spacetime , and 4d gravitational constant is related to the brane tension @xmath32 by the relation    @xmath33    the \" squared energy - momentum  tensor is given by    @xmath34,\\ ] ]    while the traceless braneworld part of the bulk energy - momentum tensor is    @xmath35    in the effective 4d ege ( [ ege])-([bulkenmomten ] ) , @xmath36 describes non - local gravitational effects of the bulk space onto the brane and is sometimes called weyl fluid , while the local bulk effects on the brane are given by @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    it should be stressed that the self - consistent solutions of the effective 4d ege ( [ ege])-([bulkenmomten ] ) on the brane require the knowledge of the non - local gravitational and energy - momentum terms coming from the bulk spacetime .",
    "therefore , the braneworld field equations are not closed in general and evolution equations into the bulk have to be solved for the projected bulk curvature and energy - momentum tensors . however , in particular cases the braneworld - equations system could be made closed assuming a special ansatz for the induced metric . in this way , both spherically symmetric @xcite and axially symmetric braneworld black hole spacetimes @xcite have been found .",
    "assuming vacuum bulk and braneworld spacetimes , the non - local gravitational effects of the bulk could be simply represented by the so called tidal charge entering the standard metric of the black hole spacetimes .",
    "the rotating black holes localized on a 3-brane in the randall - sundrum braneworld model were derived under the assumption of stationary and axisymmetric kerr - schild metric on the brane and supposing empty bulk space and no matter fields on the brane ( @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "the specialized solution of the constrained equations is thus assumed in the form    @xmath41    the effective 4d einstein equations then reduce to the form    @xmath42    where    @xmath43    is the @xmath44 part of the 5d weyl tensor , used besides the @xmath36 tensor to describe the non - local gravitational effects of the bulk space onto the brane .",
    "further , the relations    @xmath45    can be deduced from eqs ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ kappa ] ) , assuming zero cosmological constant on the brane ( @xmath46 ) . here",

    "represents the imprint of non - local ( tidal ) gravitational effects from the bulk space @xcite .",
    "the form of the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) is the same as in the case of the kerr - newman metric , with the tidal charge being replaced by the squared electric charge , @xmath3 @xcite .",

    ", we put @xmath58 in the following , using thus dimensionless coordinates and parameters .",
    "the tidal charge can be both positive and negative ; however , there are some indications favorizing negative values of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath59 , some braneworld black holes have the ring singularity of spacelike character @xcite .      in order to study the optical effects in braneworld kerr spacetimes we have to solve equations of motion of photons .",
    "it is well known that photons move along null geodesics of the spacetime under consideration .    using the hamilton - jacobi method ,",
    "carter found separated first order differential equations of motion @xcite , which in the case of the braneworld kerr spacetimes read    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    @xmath62 is the energy , @xmath63 is the axial angular momentum and @xmath64 is the constant of motion related to total angular momentum that is usually replaced by the constant @xmath65 , since for motion in the equatorial plane ( @xmath66 ) there is @xmath67 . for motion of photon , we put @xmath68 .",
    "generally , these equations can be integrated and expressed in terms of elliptic integrals @xcite",
    ". the analysis of photon motion in the kerr - newman spacetimes @xcite can be directly applied to the case of photon motion in the braneworld kerr spacetimes .",
    "it is done in @xcite ; we shall use the results in the following . as a source of radiation we consider here radiating rings composed of particles following equatorial circular geodesics .",
    "it is widely assumed that the observed profiled spectral lines of x - rays corresponding usually to the @xmath69 line at the rest energy @xmath70kev are produced in the internal parts of accretion disc near the marginally stable circular geodesic representing roughly the inner edge of the disc @xcite .",
    "therefore we briefly summarize properties of circular geodesics and the marginally stable orbits in dependence on the tidal charge @xmath1 .",
    "following the carter equations for the circular motion at a given radius @xmath50 in the equatorial plane ( @xmath66 , @xmath71 ) , we find , solving simultaneously relations @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the specific energy and angular momentum related to mass @xmath74 of the orbiting particle to be given by @xcite @xmath75 where    @xmath76    the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the corotating ( counterrotating ) orbits .",
    "the crucial limiting radii for existence of circular orbits correspond to the photon circular orbits given by the real positive roots of the equations    @xmath77    the marginally stable orbits ( @xmath78 ) are given by the relation @xcite    @xmath79    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     * @xmath59 for negative tidal charges we have fixed the value of the spin parameter to value @xmath80 close to extreme black hole state ( @xmath81 ) for kerr spacetimes ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we then illustrate the influence of the tidal charge @xmath59 for a relatively large range of its values that all correspond to the black hole spacetimes .",
    "the values of the observers inclination angle @xmath8 are chosen to represent the cases of small , mediate , extreme and very extreme inclination in order to fully exhibit the strong effect of @xmath8 on the line profile .",
    "the radius of radiating ring is restricted to the inner part of keplerian discs .",
    "again , the three values of @xmath9 reflect the optical effects in the innermost part of the disc , the mediate inner part and those where the effects of the tidal charge become to be effectively suppressed .",
    "first , the radii are fixed to be the same in all the spacetimes under consideration ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) , we have chosen @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 where the first value ( @xmath85 ) correspond to stable circular of spacetime with braneworld parameter value being @xmath88 .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[figure1 ] .",
    "we can see that the influence of the tidal charge is suppressed with growing radius , @xmath9 , as can be intuitively expected because the contributions of @xmath1 fall with @xmath50 growing faster than those of the mass and spin parameters of the spacetime and this effect is for each inclination angle @xmath8 . with @xmath50 approaching the innermost part of the disc ,",
    "the profiled lines become to be wider and flatter .",
    "these effects are strengthened for inclination angle growing , as demonstrated in fig.[figure2 ] . generally , the profiled lines has two peaks at the red - end and blue - end with the blue - end peak being always higher in comparison with the red one . for fixed @xmath59 ,",
    "the extension , @xmath89 , of the profiled line grows with @xmath8 growing and @xmath9 falling , while the difference of the profile height at the blue and red end grows with inclination growing .",
    "the tidal charge strengthens these effects while going to higher negative values ; for example the frequency shift difference @xmath89 at the radius @xmath85 and the inclination angle @xmath90 grows with descending @xmath1 such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "+ when the inclination angle reaches extreme values of @xmath94 , the profiled lines in the innermost part of the stable keplerian orbits are enriched by humps reflecting strong lensing effects caused by traversing the region in close vicinity of the black hole horizon .",
    "the two humps appearing in the profile are caused by the fact that we consider both direct and indirect photons as generating the profiled line .",
    "+ the innermost radius @xmath85 is chosen to correspond to the marginally stable orbit of k - n spacetime with @xmath80 and @xmath88 . however , for fixed @xmath95 , but @xmath96 , such a radius is far above the related marginally stable orbit at these spacetimes , since @xmath10(a=0.9981 , b=-1)=4 m while @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , in order to compare the radiating rings orbiting in close vicinity of the marginally stable orbit assumed to be the edge of a keplerian disc , we give the profiled lines at @xmath98 in fig.[figure3 ] , for the same inclination angles .",
    "now the effects of the tidal charge are represented in more precise form .",
    "again , the extension of the line @xmath89 grows more strongly with descending @xmath1 .",
    "of course , we can see that for @xmath82 , the profiled lines are strongly redshifted and suppressed in magnitude , since for @xmath82 we are dealing with a near extreme spacetime , when the radiating ring is orbiting in extremely deep gravitational potential in close vicinity of the black hole horizon . on the other hand , for @xmath99 ( @xmath88 ) the radiating ring is in much higher distance of the horizon and the gravitational field there is not so strong since these black holes ( with @xmath80 ) are far from the extreme black holes .",
    "+ the lines profiled by relativistic effects in the innermost part of the accretion disc clearly demonstrate the influence of the tidal charge as shown in fig.[figure3 ] .",
    "the lines become flatter , but again the influence of the inclination angle is quite strong , but brings some characteristic features independently on the value of @xmath1 . *",
    "now we discuss the case that could correspond also to modelling of profiled lines in the standard kerr - newman spacetimes assuming no electromagnetic interaction of the matter of the radiating ring and the black hole electric charge @xmath101 .",
    "+ while focusing our attention to the black hole spacetimes , we have to shift the spin parameter @xmath95 with changes of the tidal charge @xmath1 ( electric charge @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[figure4 ] for situations studied for the case of @xmath59 , i.e. , in the close vicinity of @xmath10 , in the middle of the innermost part of the disc and in the region where influence of @xmath1 starts to be highly suppressed .",
    "we can see that for large inclination angles ( @xmath102 ) two humps appear in the line profile , one near the red end of the line , the other close to its blue end .",
    "we have shown that the tidal charge of the braneworld rotating black holes has a general tendency to make profiled lines of the radiating rings in the inner part of an accretion disc to be wider and flatter .",
    "we constructed some theoretically grounded quantities based on characteristics of the profiled lines that could be in principle compared with data determining profiled lines observed in microquasars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "we have shown that the influence of the inclination angle on the line profiles could be stronger than that of even high values of @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "fig.[figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] ) that could make the situation difficult for estimating the black hole parameters when we have no limits on the inclination angle , but makes the estimates relatively convincing when we can strongly limit the inclination angle , as we can , at least , for some microquasars .",
    "the point is that the inclination angle influence gives some specific features on the profiled lines ( e.g. humps for very high @xmath94 ) that could serve as an additional test of the black hole parameters .",
    "it is quite important that one such a hump appears in the case of negative braneworld parameters being located near the blue end of the line , while two humps appear for positive braneworld parameters ( or equivalently for the kerr - newman spacetimes ) , one near the red end of the line , the other near the blue end of the spectral line .",
    "clearly , all the phenomena deserve attention and bring interesting , principally new results that could be extended for development of methods enabling estimates of the black hole parameters .",
