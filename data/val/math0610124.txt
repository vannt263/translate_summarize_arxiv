    "molecular dynamics is the computer simulation of a material at the atomic level . in principle",
    "the only inputs to a simulation are the characteristics of a set of particles and a description of the forces between them . an initial condition is chosen and from these first principles the evolution of the system in time is simulated using newton s laws and a simple numerical integrator @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics is a very prevalent computational practice , as a glance at an issue of the journal of chemical physics will show .",
    "it does have its limitations : the motion of only a relatively small number of particles can be simulated over a short time interval .",
    "however , most of the mesoscopic models that have been suggested to overcome these difficulties still rely on molecular dynamics as a form of calibration .",
    "it is likely that molecular dynamics will continue to be important in the future .    given its scientific importance there is very little rigourous justification of molecular dynamics simulation . from the viewpoint of numerical analysis",
    "it is surprising that it works at all .",
    "the problem is that individual trajectories computed by molecular dynamics simulations are accurate for only small time intervals . as we will see in section  [ sec : problem ] , numerical trajectories diverge rapidly from true trajectories given the step - lengths used in practice .",
    "no one disputes this fact , and no one is particularly concerned with it either .",
    "the reason is that practitioners are never interested in particular trajectories to begin with .",
    "they are interested in ensembles of trajectories . as long as the numerical trajectories are representative of a particular ensemble of true trajectories , researchers are content . however , that this statistical information is computed accurately has yet to be rigourously demonstrated in representative cases .",
    "the goal of this article is to present a concise mathematical conjecture that encapsulates this fundamental difficulty .",
    "we present a model system that is representative of systems commonly simulated in molecular dynamics .",
    "we present the results of numerical simulations of this system using the strmer - verlet method , the work - horse of molecular dynamics . in each simulation",
    "a random initial condition is generated , an approximate trajectory for the system is computed and the net displacement of one particle over the duration of the simulation is recorded .",
    "we show that even for step - sizes that are far too large to accurately compute the position of the particle , the distribution of the particle s displacement over the many initial conditions appears to be accurate . from the numerical data we conjecture a rate of convergence for this particular statistical property .",
    "we believe that if this conjectured rate of convergence ( or one like it ) can be rigourously established , even for this single system , then we will understand significantly better why molecular dynamics works .    the problem of explaining the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulation is well - known both in the physical sciences ( for example @xcite ) and in the mathematics community @xcite .",
    "this latter reference is a survey of the relation between computation and statistics for initial value problems in general .",
    "there has been plenty of excellent mathematical work that has done much to explain various features of this type of simulation , but has not resolved the issue we consider here .",
    "see @xcite for surveys .",
    "one body of work that has addressed the statistical accuracy of under - resolved trajectories in a special case is by a.  stuart and co - workers . in @xcite they have explored some linear test systems with provable statistical properties in the limit of large numbers of particles .",
    "they are able to show that if the systems are simulated with appropriate methods the statistical features of numerical trajectories are accurate in the same limit even when the step - lengths are too large to resolve trajectories .",
    "though these results are interesting since they are the only ones of their kind now known , for the highly nonlinear problems of practical molecular dynamics very different arguments will be required .",
    "one subproblem that has been attacked more successfully is that of the computation of ergodic averages .",
    "these are averages of functions along very long trajectories .",
    "all that numerical trajectories have to do to get these correct is sample the entire phase space evenly .",
    "this is a much weaker property than getting all statistical features correct .",
    "the most striking work on this question is by s.  reich @xcite which establishes rapid convergence of ergodic averages for hamiltonian systems which are uniformly hyperbolic on sets of constant energy .",
    "unfortunately , this property has never been established for realistic systems , and is unlikely to hold for them @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite established similar results for systems with much weaker properties but requires radically small time steps for convergence to occur .",
    "the contribution of this work is to precisely specify a simple problem which encapsulates all the essential difficulties of the more general problem . in section  [ sec : system ]",
    "we present the system we will study .",
    "section  [ sec : problem ] shows the results of some numerical experiments on this system .",
    "there we state our conjecture based on the results . in section",
    "[ sec : approaches ] we will discuss two possible approaches to proving the conjecture . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : discussion ] we will discuss prospects for the eventual resolution of the conjecture .",
    "the system consists of @xmath0 point particles interacting on an 11.5 by 11.5 square periodic domain .",
    "we let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the positions and velocities of the particles , with @xmath3 denoting the position and velocity of particle @xmath4 .",
    "the motion of the system is described by a system of hamiltonian differential equations : @xmath5 with hamiltonian @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the famous lennard - jones potential . in our simulations we use a truncated version : @xmath8 figure  [ fig : movie ] shows the positions of the particles on the periodic domain for one state of the system . though the particles are only points , in the figure each is represented by a circle of radius 1/2 .",
    "we take our initial conditions @xmath9 to be randomly distributed according to the probability density function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is chosen so that the function integrates to one .",
    "this is known as the canonical distribution ( or ensemble ) for the system at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "there is a simple physical interpretation of this distribution : if the system is weakly connected to another very large system at temperature @xmath12 , this is the distribution we will find the original system in after a long period of time . in our units @xmath13 , and we choose @xmath14 .",
    "there are many ways of sampling from the canonical distribution at a given temperature . for our experiments we generated initial conditions using langevin dynamics .",
    "see @xcite for an explanation of this technique and a comparison with other methods . if done correctly , the precise method of sampling from the canonical distribution will have no bearing on the results of the experiments we will present subsequently .",
    "the numerical method we use for integrating our system is the strmer - verlet scheme .",
    "given an initial @xmath15 and a @xmath16 it generates a sequence of states @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "the version of the algorithm we use is @xmath19 this is a second - order explicit method .",
    "it is symplectic , and as a consequence conserves phase space volume @xcite .",
    "finally we have to decide upon our step - length @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is too large the energy of the computed solution will increase rapidly and explode . in practice",
    ", it is observed that for small enough step lengths energy remains within a narrow band of the true energy for very long time intervals .",
    "( there is extensive theoretical justification for this phenomenon , see section  [ subsec : bea ] ) .",
    "practitioners tend to pick a @xmath20 as large as possible while still maintaining this long - term stability on their time interval of interest . for the system and initial conditions",
    "we describe here @xmath22 yields good approximate energy conservation on the time interval @xmath23 $ ] . for our numerical experiments we will let @xmath20 take this value and smaller . (",
    "the recommended value in @xcite , a standard reference , for this type of system is @xmath24 . )",
    "we will first examine how well trajectories are computed with @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : convergtraj ] shows the computed @xmath26-position of one particle versus time for the same initial conditions and for a range of step - lengths .",
    "if the trajectory computed by strmer - verlet is accurate over the time interval @xmath27 $ ] , we expect that reducing the time step by a factor of a thousand would not yield a significantly different curve .",
    "however , we see that the two curves for @xmath28 and @xmath29 very quickly diverge .",
    "they are distinguishable to the eye almost immediately and completely diverge around @xmath30 time units .    reducing the step length to @xmath31",
    "gives a curve that agrees with the @xmath29 line longer , but still diverges around @xmath32 time units .",
    "similarly , even with @xmath33 trajectory is not accurate over the whole interval depicted .    from these numerical results , we might conjecture that reducing the step - length by a constant factor only extends the duration for which the simulation is accurate by a constant amount of time .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical results about the convergence of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations .",
    "what is surprising in this case is that the time - scale on which the trajectories are valid appears to be miniscule compared to the time - scale on which computation are actually performed .",
    "it seems that the trajectories we compute here with stepsize even as small as @xmath29 are not accuarate over the whole interval @xmath27 $ ] let alone over considerably longer intervals .",
    "fortunately we almost never care about what one particular trajectory is doing in molecular dynamics .",
    "we only care about statistical features of the trajectories when initial conditions are selected according to some probability distribution . here",
    "we will consider the example of self - diffusion .",
    "self - diffusion is the diffusion of one particular particle through a bath of identical particles .",
    "we can imagine somehow marking one particle at time zero and watching its motion through the system .",
    "this single - particle trajectory will depend on the positions and velocities of all the particles ( including itself ) at time zero .",
    "since these are random , the trajectory of the single particle is random .",
    "one way to measure self - diffusion is to look at the distribution of the @xmath26-coordinate of the tracer particle relative to its initial condition . to estimate this ,",
    "we generate many random initial conditions , perform the simulation using the strmer - verlet method , and record the net displacement of the particle in the given direction . figures  [ fig : hists ] show the histograms of these displacements at time @xmath34 for three different step - lengths .",
    "in contrast to the case where we examined single trajectories , here the histograms are virtually identical for the different step - lengths .",
    "this suggests that any information we glean from the first histogram will be accurate .    to check this",
    "more carefully , we compute the variance of the total displacement at various times @xmath35 for varying step - lengths .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the total displacement of the particle after time @xmath35 .",
    "this is a random quantity through its dependence on the state of the system at @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote this same displacement as simulated with the strmer - verlet method .",
    "this also is a random quantity .",
    "now define @xmath39 to be the expected value of @xmath40 when the initial conditions are chosen according to the canonical distribution .",
    "let us see how this last quantity depends on @xmath20 .",
    "we do this by generating many initial conditions from the canonical ensemble and then simulating the system for 100 time units , keeping track of the total displacement of the tracer particle .",
    "figure  [ fig : selfdiffuse ] shows @xmath41 versus @xmath35 for three choices of step length .",
    "the inset shows a subset of the data with error bars . up to the sampling error there is no difference between the curves .",
    "as far as we can tell from this plot , the answers for @xmath42 are accurate .",
    "the time - scale is much larger than the short interval we found the trajectory to be accurate over .",
    "lest we give the impression that @xmath41 depends linearly on @xmath35 , figure  [ fig : zoom ] shows the same results for a smaller time interval .",
    "we conjecture that the reason @xmath41 does not appear to depend on @xmath20 is that even for these large values of @xmath20 it closely matches @xmath43 .",
    "it is not clear at all what the rate of convergence of @xmath38 to @xmath44 is and how it depends on @xmath35 .",
    "however we make the following conjecture :    [ conj ] for the system described in section  [ sec : system ] with the initial distribution given by ( [ eq : distrib ] ) and the strmer - verlet integrator with time step @xmath20 @xmath45 for all @xmath46 $ ] , for some constants @xmath47 .",
    "we will explain the reasons for hypothesizing this particular dependence in the next section . here",
    "we will briefly note what dependence the classical theory of convergence for numerical odes gives : @xmath48 for @xmath49 $ ] for sufficiently small @xmath20 for some @xmath50 .",
    "( see @xcite , for example . )",
    "so we need to explain why the error remains so small even for long simulations .",
    "we will discuss two possible approaches to proving conjecture  [ conj ] : backward error analysis and shadowing .",
    "typically a @xmath51th order numerical method applied to a system of odes computes a trajectory that is @xmath52 close to the exact trajectory on a finite interval .",
    "backward error analysis is a way of showing that the numerical trajectory is an @xmath53 approximation to the exact trajectory of a perturbed system .",
    "this result can be used in turn to prove results about the stability of the numerical trajectory .",
    "see @xcite for an early reference and ( * ? ? ?",
    "ix . ) for a recent comprehensive treatment of the subject .",
    "if we apply a symplectic integrator to a hamiltonian system it turns out that the modified system is also hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian function @xmath54 for the new system can be written as @xmath55 .",
    "there are two consequences for us .",
    "firstly , the numerical method agrees very closely with the exact solutions of the modified hamiltonian on short time intervals .",
    "if we denote the solution to the modified system with the same initial conditions by @xmath56 then @xmath57 $ ] , for some appropriate constants @xcite .",
    "( this alone is not useful for analysing molecular dynamics since @xmath35 and @xmath20 are both large . ) secondly , the modified hamiltonian @xmath54 is conserved extremely well by the numerical method for long time intervals : @xmath58 for @xmath59 $ ] . putting this together with @xmath55 gives @xmath60 for @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "we chose the bound in conjecture 1 in analogy with this last result .",
    "suppose we wanted to bound the error between @xmath61 and @xmath62 using these estimates .",
    "the fact that the initial conditions are random adds an extra level of complication to the problem .",
    "we have been using @xmath63 to denote the average with respect to the canonical distribution for the hamiltonian @xmath64 .",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath54 has a different canonical distribution .",
    "we denote averages with respect to it by @xmath65 .",
    "we let @xmath66 denote the net displacement of the tracer particle under the new flow given by @xmath54 .",
    "we might try bounding the error in the following way : @xmath67 we discuss each of the three terms in turn .",
    "the first term is due to the numerical trajectory not agreeing with the exact trajectory of the modified system with hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "according to ( [ eqn : smaller ] ) we can bound this term by @xmath68 for a duration of @xmath69 .",
    "the studies in @xcite suggest that this is a tight estimate for typical molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the second term is the difference in the expectation of @xmath70 due to a perturbation in the measure .",
    "since the two measures are proportional to @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , and @xmath73 , we expect this term to be on the order of @xmath74 for all @xmath35 .",
    "this probably can be rigourously controlled without much difficulty .",
    "the third term is just the difference in @xmath62 between the original system and the perturbed system .",
    "this is likely to be extremely difficult to bound .",
    "however , showing that it is small is not a question about computation but about statistical physics . for",
    "now let us assume that it is @xmath74 for all @xmath35 for now .",
    "already we can see that this approach will not get us the result that we want , even assuming we can bound the third term .",
    "the best estimate we have so far is that the error is bounded by @xmath74 for @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "the bound would hold on an interval much shorter than what is needed .",
    "it appears that backward error analysis alone can not explain the observed convergence .",
    "the idea of shadowing is complementary to that of backward error analysis . whereas backward error analysis shows that the numerical trajectory is close to the exact trajectory of a different hamiltonian system with the same initial condition , shadowing attempts to show that the numerical trajectory is close to an exact trajectory of the same hamiltonian system with a different initial condition .",
    "see @xcite for a nice review of shadowing for hamiltonian systems .",
    "in our situation , if shadowing were possible , something like the following would hold .",
    "suppose we compute a numerical trajectory starting from @xmath76 with time step @xmath20 , which we denote by @xmath77 .",
    "if shadowing is possible then there is an exact trajectory @xmath78 of the same hamiltonian system starting at some other initial condition @xmath79 such that @xmath80 for @xmath81 in some large range of times . assuming that it is possible to shadow every numerical trajectory in this way ,",
    "let us denote the map on the phase space that takes the numerical initial condition to the initial condition of the shadow trajectory by @xmath82    the idea of shadowing is used very effectively by s.  reich in @xcite . for a hamiltonian system for which shadowing holds",
    "he demonstrates that long - time averages will be computed accurately by almost all numerical trajectories .",
    "that is , @xmath83 for almost all initial conditions @xmath84 , for reasonable functions @xmath85 . since the quantity on the left does not depend on @xmath86 in the systems considered in @xcite ( except for sets of measure zero )",
    ", it is sufficient that such a map @xmath87 exists to get the result .    in our case",
    "we are interested in more general statistical features of trajectories than long - time averages .",
    "for example , the variance of the displacement of a single particle in a finite time interval can not be put into the form of a long - time average such as in @xmath88 .",
    "this puts more stringent requirements on @xmath87 . to show that statistics are captured correctly",
    "we can not consider just single trajectories ; we have make sure the entire ensemble s statistics are reproduced correctly .",
    "if the shadowing map @xmath87 systematically picked initial conditions for which the tracer particle tended to move to the left , for example , then the computed statistics could be quite inaccurate .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of this issue in the context of astrophysics .",
    "what is necessary for this shadowing to work is for @xmath87 to leave the canonical ensemble invariant : @xmath89 for some suitably broad class of functions @xmath90 on phase space .",
    "this is an even more stringent requirement than just that shadowing is possible at all , and it may be quite unlikely to hold for our system .    fortunately we can weaken some other requirements demanded of shadowing considerably for our problem .",
    "we do not need the trajectory of the whole system to be close ; we only need the trajectory of a single particle to be close .",
    "suppose that our tracer particle s numerical trajectory is denoted by @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "we say that _ weak shadowing _ holds if we can select @xmath93 , @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for @xmath81 in some long range of times .    to see how this fits in with the conjecture",
    "suppose that we have both ( [ eqn : preserve ] ) and @xmath96 for @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "this means that ( assuming we can obtain reasonable bounds on @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) that @xmath100 for @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "here we have let @xmath90 be the composition of the time @xmath35 flow map of the hamiltonian system with the 2-norm .",
    "now the first term above is bounded by @xmath101 by ( [ eqn : hardthing ] ) and the second term is @xmath102 by ( [ eqn : preserve ] ) , thus establishing the conjecture . simultaneously proving ( [ eqn : preserve ] ) and ( [ eqn : hardthing ] ) for some shadowing map @xmath87 may not be easy , but it may be much easier than proving the usual stronger shadowing result .",
    "despite the ideas presented in the previous section , the conjecture we have presented is probably not open to attack by existing techniques .",
    "the problem is that there is no rigourous mathematical theory of how statistical regularities emerge from the dynamics of generic high - dimensional hamiltonian systems .",
    "consequently , there is no theory of how perturbations in the hamiltonian dynamics leads to perturbation in the statistics .",
    "a numerical analyst has three choices when faced with this situation :    1 .   *",
    "take up mathematical physics . *",
    "if we are to make progress on the conjecture these entirely non - numerical problems need to be tackled first . mathematical physicists are interested in proving things like ergodicity and decay of correlations for hamiltonian systems such as presented here , and it is conceivable that eventually there will a robust body of theory that we can apply to our problem .",
    "so one possibility is to work on developing such a theory .",
    "this likely will not have much to do with computation .",
    "2 .   * relax standards of rigour .",
    "* theoretical physicists , as opposed to mathematical physicists , have accepted that much reliable information can be obtained through calculations that can not be rigourously justified . typically theoretical",
    "physicists study systems about which nothing interesting can be proved ; to do otherwise would be far too restrictive .",
    "there is no reason why this informal yet highly fruitful style of reasoning should be restricted to systems themselves and not numerical discretizations of systems .",
    "a combination of non - rigourous arguments and careful numerical experiments could do a lot to clarify how the strmer - verlet method is able to compute statistics so accurately for our system .",
    "3 .   * abandon the whole pursuit . * for many ,",
    "the purpose of numerical analysis is to provide reliable , efficient algorithms .",
    "if one is pursuing a theoretical question , it is hoped that it will lead to better algorithms eventually . sadly , even a complete resolution of the conjecture we have presented in unlikely to have much effect on computational practice .",
    "many people have tried for years to devise an integrator that is more efficient than the strmer - verlet method for computing statistically accurate trajectories in molecular dynamics .",
    "they have only been successful for hamiltonian systems with special structure .",
    "( the prime example of this is the multiple time stepping methods , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "viii.4 ) . ) in fact , we state another conjecture which is not formulated rigourously .",
    "+ [ conj : solver ] no integration scheme can improve the efficiency by more than a factor of two with which strmer - verlet computes statistically accurate trajectories for systems like that in section  [ sec : system ] .",
    "+ here even a clear mathematical formulation would be a challenge .",
    "obviously if we already know a lot about a system we can contrive an algorithm which will give correct statistics for a tracer particle , but this does not count .",
    "the conjecture is intended to capture the idea that strmer - verlet is a very general purpose method ; we do not need to know anything about a system to apply it .",
