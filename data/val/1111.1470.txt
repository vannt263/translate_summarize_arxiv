    ". moreover , the carbon coatings can endow magnetic particles with biocompatibility and stability in many organic and inorganic media @xcite .",
    "the instability , large aggregation , and rapid biodegradation of the pure uncoated ( naked ) magnetic nanoparticles could be overcome by replacement of the naked magnetic nanoparticles by the encapsulated ones , since the intrinsic properties of the inner magnetic cores in this case are well protected by outer carbon shells , which in turn gives many possibilities for further modification .",
    "besides , the combination of carbon coating and metallic cores having ` core - shell ' structure provides unusual catalytic properties to these nanocomposites @xcite .",

    "we have concentrated the main attention for study of ni@c nanoparticles .",
    "the previous studies are completed ( i ) by measurements of x - ray emission spectra ( xes ) , ( ii ) by studies of ni@c nanoparticles after 2 years storage , ( iii ) by calculations of the electronic structure of ni@c using the density functional theory ( dft ) for different models of carbon coating .",
    "we will show that the carbon shell of ni nanoparticles can be described by multilayer graphene with some amount of stone  wales defects .",
    "nanocomposites ni@c were produced by evaporation of overheated ( @xmath0c ) ni liquid drop by blowing up a buffer inert gas ( ar ) containing a hydrocarbon as described in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the melting of ni drop performed by induction levitation system which provides clean conditions ( no impurities and oxygen ) for the obtained nanocomposites .",
    "the morphological characteristics and the structural parameters of the composites were analyzed by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy .",

    "the additional peaks in the c  1s xps spectrum of ni@c ( 2 ) at 285.5  ev , 286.6  ev , and 288.8  ev can be identified as hydroxyl ( oh ) , carbonyl ( c@xmath12o ) , and carboxyl ( o@xmath12c  oh ) groups attached to the carbon atom in ni@c @xcite , respectively , as it is shown in [ f : xps - c1s - nic ] .",

    "the combined use of the c  k@xmath1 x - ray emission and c  1s x - ray absorption spectra ( the upper part of [ f : c1s - xas - xes - dos - nic ] ) shows that there is no gap between the occupied and unoccupied c 2p states of ni@c .",

    "two additional features in the c 1s x - ray absorption spectrum near the fermi level ( features _ a _ and _ b _ in [ f : c1s - xas - nic - multi ] ) are caused by the presence of sw defects [ feature _ a _ at @xmath16  ev   see also [ f : dos ] ( a),(b ) ] and overlapping of the electronic states of graphene layers with those of the nickel substrate [ feature _ b _ at about 1 ev   see [ f : dos ] ( e ) ] .",
    "the comparison of the calculated density of states and c 1s xas and c k@xmath1 xes spectra shows that the most appropriate structural model for the carbon coating of ni@c particles is graphene multilayers with high concentration of sw defects ( one per 18 carbon atoms  about 6  % ) but some electronic contribution from the nearest to the ni core carbon shells should be taken into account .",
    "the similarity of c k@xmath1 xes and c  1s xas spectra of ni@c ( [ f : c1s - xas - xes - dos - nic ] ) with those of polymerized fullerene @xcite evidences the presence of not only hexagonal but also pentagonal rings of carbon atoms .",
    "the presence of these defects leads to increased chemical activity of carbon encapsulated metals in comparison with that of flat carbon systems @xcite , which is experimentalyl confirmed by surface oxidation of the ni@c ( 2 ) sample .",
    "the appearance of stone  wales defects caused by spherical shape of the particles or reconstruction of the defects on the graphene - nickel interface was found experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic and atomic structures of carbon - coated ni nanoparticles by means of x - ray absorption , emission , and photoelectron spectroscopies and dft calculations .",
    "results of the measurements suggest that the atomic and electronic structures of ni cores are similar to those of metallic ni .",
    "absence of any secondary phases and traces of oxidation of ni after two years of exposure of ni@c nanoparticles in air at ambient conditions confirms good protection properties of the carbon shell .",
    "measurements of x - ray absorption and photoelectron spectra demostrate some oxidation of the carbon shell .",
    "comparison of experimental x - ray spectra and calculated densities of states points to the graphite - like structure of the carbon shell with significant amount ( about 6% ) of stone  wales defects .",
