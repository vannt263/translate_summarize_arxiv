    "in the past few years , there has been a tremendous increase in the number of studies of lattice dynamical systems , especially in the context of differential - difference equations , where the evolution variable is continuum and the spatial dependence is inherently or effectively posed on a lattice @xcite .",
    "such settings appear to be ubiquitous in very diverse physical contexts ranging from the spatial dynamics of optical beams in coupled waveguide arrays in nonlinear optics @xcite to the dynamical behavior of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices in soft - condensed matter physics @xcite , and even the dna double strand in biophysics @xcite , among others .",
    "one of the principal foci of this research effort is the analysis of the features of the localized , solitary wave solutions of such lattices .",
    "discrete solitons @xcite , and various more exotic structures such as dipole solitons , soliton - trains , soliton - necklaces and vector solitons were recently observed in optical contexts such as photorefractive materials @xcite . at the same time , experimental developments in the physics of becs closely follow with prominent recent results , including the observation of bright , dark and gap solitons in quasi - one - dimensional settings @xcite .",
    "another trend that has recently been followed is to study small lattices , such as those pertaining to double or triple - well potentials .",
    "the aim there is to better understand the underlying physics of such simpler dynamical systems and subsequently explore how much of the relevant phenomenology may persist in the infinite lattice limit .",
    "it is interesting to note that few - site lattices were among the first ones to be explored thoroughly , starting with the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "since then , a variety of theoretical works also examined features relevant especially to double - well ( such as symmetry - breaking @xcite ) , triple - well ( such as oscillatory instabilities @xcite and chaotic behavior @xcite , among others ) , or even multi- ( but few- ) well potentials ( such as synchronization @xcite ) .",
    "most of the above studies were done in the prototypical nonlinear envelope wave equation that is equally applicable to each of the above mentioned physical settings ( in appropriate parameter regimes ) , namely the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) .    in that vein ,",
    "recent experiments in both optical media @xcite and in becs @xcite have revealed a host of interesting phenomena such as symmetry breaking in double - well potentials , and constructive ( destructive ) interference of in ( out - of- ) phase pulses in triple - well media , among others .",
    "more generally , few - site lattices such as those we are going to address in what follows appear to be within the reach of state - of - art technology in optically trapped becs .",
    "actually , ref .",
    "@xcite reports on the analysis of the evolution of the density distribution and relative phase of a boson josephson junction .",
    "such a two - site system was realized by isolating a single `` edge '' of an optical lattice via an additional confining potential .",
    "likewise , single `` plaquettes '' of suitable two - dimensional  possibly quasiperiodic  lattices @xcite can be used to create few - site closed rings .",
    "a further interesting proposal is based on transverse electromagnetic modes of laser beams @xcite .",
    "our main focus here is on the ground - state properties of a system of interacting particles , hopping in a few - site lattice , described by the dnls equation .",
    "we emphasize that this is an important issue for any low- ( virtually zero- ) temperature system , in particular for ultracold bosons . in this respect , on lattices , the mean - field description in terms of the dnls equations , which results from a variational approach to the quantum ground - state , proved to be quite satisfactory with both repulsive @xcite and attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "naturally , a great deal of the relevant phenomenology has been analyzed .",
    "however , we hope to illustrate that there some of the properties of low energy states are still unexplored and yet are particularly intriguing in simple and interesting systems such as the few - site lattices . as is well known , in the case of attractive , `` focusing '' interaction , the ground state of the homogeneous systems under investigation exhibits a delocalization transition @xcite driven by the effective intersite coupling @xmath1 .",
    "the threshold for localization is in general identified with the occurrence of modulational instability in the uniform ground state characterizing the system at large values of @xmath1 .",
    "here we show that this identification applies only to sufficiently large lattices .",
    "conversely , on small lattices , these two thresholds are distinct , the delocalization transition occurring at a larger value of @xmath1 .",
    "as we will illustrate , this feature can be understood in terms of the complex interplay of three low - energy solutions to the dnls equations governing the system .",
    "these are the uniform state and two localized solutions that , for reasons that will become clear shortly , we refer to as _ single - pulse _ and _ two - pulse _ state , respectively .",
    "these two localized solutions emerge as excited states from a saddle - node bifurcation point below some threshold in @xmath1 . as this parameter",
    "is further lowered below the delocalization threshold , the symmetry - breaking single - pulse state becomes the ground state of the system , but this does not influence the stability properties of the uniform state . as we will show , this feature can be in principle exploited to access metastable states of the system . lowering @xmath1 further eventually results in the uniform - state modulational instability , caused by a bifurcation involving the uniform state and the two - pulse state .",
    "as we discuss in section [ s : numres ] , this critical point , which we dub _",
    "double transcritical bifurcation _",
    ", exhibits non - standard features which , to the best of our knowledge , have not been observed previously .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section [",
    "s : setup ] we introduce the model and recall the known results about its ground state . in section [ s : pert ]",
    "we show that interesting insight in the bifurcations involving the uniform state can be gained through a simple perturbative approach . in section [ s : trimer ] this analytical insight is fully developed for the case of the three - site lattice .",
    "section [ s : numres ] contains the numerical results for lattices comprising of @xmath2 sites .",
    "in particular , we discuss the non trivial features of the double transcritical bifurcation related to the uniform - state modulational instability , and illustrate how the known situation for large lattices is recovered for @xmath3 .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ s : concl ] .",
    "in the following , we consider the standard dnls equation on a @xmath4-site one - dimensional closed lattice , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the discrete laplacian , and periodic boundary conditions are implemented by identifying sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this equation is derived from the hamiltonian @xmath9 making use of the standard poisson brackets @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we recall that hamiltonian ( [ e : h1 ] ) is the semiclassical counterpart of the bose - hubbard model standardly adopted for describing ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite . in more detail , eq .",
    "( [ e : h1 ] ) is obtained by approximating the quantum states with suitable coherent states and subsequently implementing a standard variational method .",
    "direct comparison shows that hamiltonian ( [ e : h1 ] ) provides a description of the ground state properties of the fully quantum model that is satisfactory in many respects , both in the case of repulsive @xcite and attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "we also recall that in this framework @xmath11 and @xmath12  denoting the intersite coupling across adjacent sites and the boson - boson interaction , respectively  are directly related to experimental parameters that can be varied over a wide range of values @xcite . as to @xmath13",
    ", it is a macroscopic complex variable describing the bosonic population , @xmath14 , and phase , @xmath15 , at lattice site @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to prove that the total population @xmath17 is conserved along the dynamics @xcite .    as we mention in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , we focus on the case of attractive interactions , @xmath18 . before proceeding with our discussion , we observe that the only independent parameter in eq .",
    "( [ dnlse1 ] ) other than the lattice size @xmath4 is the effective ( rescaled ) intersite coupling , @xmath19 .",
    "actually , eq .",
    "( [ dnlse1 ] ) can be recast in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the dot now denotes the derivative with respect to the rescaled time variable @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested in the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ e : h1 ] ) , i.e. in the state @xmath23 minimizing @xmath24 therefore @xmath23 satisfies the equation @xmath25 where the eigenvalue @xmath26 is a lagrange multiplier taking into account the constraint @xmath27 stemming from the norm conservation .",
    "we note that the solutions to the nonlinear eigenvalue problem eq .",
    "( [ dnls3 ] ) correspond to the standing wave solutions to eq .",
    "( [ dnls2 ] ) of the form @xmath28 .",
    "let us now recall some well known facts about this ground state . for small values of the intersite coupling @xmath1 ,",
    "the ground state of the system is known to break the translational invariance of @xmath29 .",
    "actually for vanishing @xmath1 s , i.e. , in the so - called _ anticontinuum limit _ , it is easy to check that the ground state is completely localized at a single lattice site @xmath30 , @xmath31 . as the intersite coupling is increased , the width of the localization peak increases while maintaining its single - pulse profile , i.e. remaining mirror - symmetric with respect to the central site @xmath30 , @xmath32 .",
    "hence we refer to this solution of eq .",
    "( [ dnls3 ] ) as _ single - pulse _ state .",
    "note that the localization peak of the single pulse state can be centered at any lattice site , so that the symmetry breaking ground - state is @xmath4-fold degenerate .",
    "conversely , for sufficiently large values of @xmath1 , the translational symmetry is recovered , the ground state being the uniform ( i.e. delocalized ) state @xmath33 , of energy @xmath34 .",
    "the ( finite ) critical value of the intersite coupling at which the inversion in the nature of the ground state occurs is referred to as delocalization threshold .",
    "this critical value is usually identified with the threshold below which the uniform state becomes modulationally unstable @xcite , @xmath35 in the following we will show that this identification is correct only for @xmath36 , whereas on smaller lattices the delocalization threshold occurs at a critical value @xmath37 . furthermore we will show that the threshold for modulational instability corresponds to a non - standard bifurcation involving the uniform state and a low - energy localized solution to eq .",
    "( [ dnls3 ] )",
    ". we will refer to the latter as _ two - pulse state _ since , unlike the single - pulse state , its localization peak features a maximum at two adjacent sites , reducing to @xmath38 in the anticontinuum limit .",
    "in this section we focus on the possible bifurcations involving the uniform state @xmath39 , which is the ground - state of the system for sufficiently large @xmath1 s .",
    "hence we look for nonuniform solutions to eq .",
    "( [ dnls3 ] ) that become uniform as the intersite coupling @xmath1 approaches a finite value . adopting a simple perturbative approach ,",
    "we introduce a linear parameter @xmath40 such that @xmath41 and assume that states of the form @xmath42 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ dnls3 ] ) with @xmath43 . after some simple manipulations one gets @xmath44 according to eq .",
    "( [ lin2 ] ) , the imaginary part of the perturbation is uniform , @xmath45 .",
    "hence , it can be absorbed in the unperturbed uniform state as a phase factor , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "as to the real part , it is easy to prove that the coefficient @xmath48 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) must vanish , which suggests that spatially modulated solutions branch - off tangentially from the uniform state .",
    "this is obtained summing eq .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) over @xmath16 and making use of the constraint @xmath49 stemming at linear order from the normalization for the perturbed solution , @xmath50 .",
    "( [ lin1 ] ) is formally equivalent to the eigenvalue equation for the discrete laplacian operator @xmath51 on a @xmath4-site homogeneous one - dimensional lattice such as that under investigation , the laplacian features @xmath4 eigenvalues of the form @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "these define a set of critical values for the intersite coupling , @xmath54^{-1}$ ] , where nonuniform solutions become uniform .",
    "the relevant perturbative modulations have the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a phase that ensures that two solutions corresponding to the same @xmath57 are independent .",
    "note that @xmath58 must be discarded , since it corresponds to a vanishing perturbation , and that @xmath59 .",
    "hence , according to this picture , one expects @xmath60 distinct critical values , where @xmath61 denotes the largest integer smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "we now observe that @xmath63 , and that the largest critical value @xmath64 coincides with the known threshold for modulational instability reported in eq .",
    "( [ dnls10 ] ) .",
    "this means that modulational instability occurs in correspondence to a bifurcation point where nonuniform solutions merge with the uniform state .",
    "note that , for suitable choice of the phase @xmath56 , these nonuniform solutions @xmath65 may have either a single - pulse or a two - pulse character .",
    "explicit analytic results for the three - site lattice and numeric results for larger lattices , reported respectively in secs .",
    "[ s : trimer ] and [ s : numres ] , will confirm this scenario .",
    "these results will also evidence the non - trivial character of the bifurcation point corresponding to the onset of modulational instability .",
    "as to the remaining critical points , it can be proved that they correspond to bifurcations involving nonuniform solutions that in the anticontinuum limit @xmath66 reduce to the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes different lattice sites . since these bifurcations occur when the uniform state is unstable , and therefore not the ground state of the system , their detailed study goes beyond the purpose of this paper .",
    "we now turn to the analytically tractable case of the three - site lattice . as illustrated in the previous sections , the uniform , single- and two - pulse solutions to eq .",
    "( [ dnls3 ] ) are expected to play a significant role in relation to the ground state of the system . in this simple case ,",
    "all of these three states correspond to a triplet @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "hence they can be described by a unique parameter @xmath72 .",

    "they merely have the same energy for fixed norm .",
    "also , the collision occurring at @xmath115 appears to be definitely non - standard , from a bifurcation theory point of view .",
    "this is not only because of the `` tangency '' of the two branches at the critical point , but also due to the fact that , contrary to what would be expected from such an apparent transcritical bifurcation , the branches do not exchange their stability , but rather the two - pulse branch _ remains _ linearly unstable ( before , as well as after the collision ) .",

    "double _ eigenvalue .",
    "this double eigenvalue approaches @xmath116 , as @xmath117 ( recall that stabilization implies that this real eigenvalue pair should become imaginary as @xmath1 crosses @xmath86 , hence its square should change sign ) .",
    "for the two - site branch , an imaginary eigenvalue ( for @xmath118 , shown by green line in the figures ) tends to zero ( and becomes real for @xmath92 ) .",
    "however , in order for the multiplicity to be preserved ( given the double eigenvalue of the uniform state ) , an additional eigenvalue should cross zero at this critical point ( this time , coming from the real side , namely the blue line in fig .",
    "[ dfigb ] ) . as a result , along the former eigendirection , indeed there is a transcritical exchange of stability , however , the latter eigendirection enforces an additional change of stability for the two - site branch .",
    "this results in a novel and non - standard scenario that we call the `` double transcritical '' bifurcation resulting in one of the branches being _",
    "unstable before and unstable after _ the critical point .",
    "concerning the ground - state properties of such small - size lattices , the above analysis and numerics confirm an important feature made visible by the analytical study of the case @xmath69 , that is the presence of a critical value of @xmath1 where the inversion in the nature of the ground state takes place .",
    "this feature , in fact , does _ not always _ occur at the critical point for the modulational instability of the uniform state , @xmath86 , but rather at the crossing point @xmath108 previously discussed .",

    "likewise , there is an interval @xmath120 $ ] where the ground state is uniform , and the single - pulse state is an excited ( i.e. , higher energy for the same norm ) stable state .",
    "a further feature worth emphasizing is that the latter terminates at a finite value , @xmath121 , due to its collision with the high - energy single - pulse branch discussed above .",

    "[ dfig3 ] shows that the picture offered above with the relevant regimes persists for 3- , 4- and 5-site lattices , while for lattices with 6 or more sites the three critical points marking the boundaries of intervals @xmath124 and @xmath125 collapse to the single value @xmath115 described by eq .",
    "( [ dnls10 ] ) . that is to say , for @xmath3 the two intervals shrink to a single point , and the change in the nature of the ground state occurs at the critical point for the modulational instability of the uniform state .",
    "furthermore , for sufficiently large @xmath4 s , the latter is basically linear in the lattice size @xmath126 , so that the above discussed picture is recovered in the thermodynamic limit @xmath127 .",
    "we have illustrated that dynamical lattices ( and , in particular , small ones ) still harbor a variety of surprises .",
    "they can host previously unraveled bifurcations ( such as the `` double transcritical '' one elucidated above ) ; they may feature ground state inversions , as well as coexistence of stability between uniform and localized states .",
    "they may even be unable to sustain localized solutions for sufficiently strong tunneling .",
    "all these numerically observed traits can also be captured analytically .    among the various features we have discussed in section [",
    "s : numres ] , the inversion effect characterizing the ground state of small lattices appears to be particularly interesting . for @xmath128",
    "both the uniform state and the single - pulse state are stable solutions of the model within the interval @xmath129 .",
    "such an interval is absent for @xmath130 .",
    "the unexpected feature that we have evidenced is that at the intermediate value @xmath108 of such an interval a change in the nature of the ground state between the uniform and the single - pulse state takes place .",
    "this inversion is driven by the parameter @xmath1",
    ". an interesting consequence of this feature is that , at least in principle , by adiabatically decreasing @xmath1 across @xmath108 the system can remain in the uniform state without decaying in the proper ( single - pulse ) ground state .",
    "a similar effect can be enacted when adiabatically increasing @xmath1 over @xmath108 . in this case",
    "the single - pulse state ( the ground state for @xmath131 ) survives for @xmath132 once more leaving the system in an excited state . as discussed above ,",
    "current experimental technology furnishing two - site lattices @xcite makes forthcoming the realization of @xmath133 small lattices .",
    "given the experimental tractability of both optical waveguide arrays @xcite and becs in optical lattices @xcite , the features we have shown to distinguish few - site lattices should have directly measurable implications in nonlinear optics , as well as soft condensed matter physics .",
    "they also generate further intriguing questions , such as e.g. the origin of the `` criticality '' of the 6-site lattice which are particularly worthwhile to address in future studies .    .",

    "<S> we investigate the ground state of a system of interacting particles in small nonlinear lattices with @xmath0 sites , using as a prototypical example the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation that has been recently used extensively in the contexts of nonlinear optics of waveguide arrays , and bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the presence of attractive interactions , the dynamical scenario relevant to the ground state and the lowest - energy modes of such few - site nonlinear lattices reveals a variety of nontrivial features that are absent in the large / infinite lattice limits : the single - pulse solution and the uniform solution are found to coexist in a finite range of the lattice intersite coupling where , depending on the latter , one of them represents the ground state ; in addition , the single - pulse mode does not even exist beyond a critical parametric threshold . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the onset of the ground state ( modulational ) instability appears to be intimately connected with a non - standard ( `` double transcritical '' ) type of bifurcation that , to the best of our knowledge , has not been reported previously in other physical systems . </S>"
