    "while these variability classes have clearly established strong connections between the accretion disk and the jet , the physical processes behind this disk - jet connection have yet to be completely revealed .",
    "in an effort to quantify the physics of these unusual variability classes and the disk - jet connection in grs 1915 + 105 , we recently analyzed @xmath3 years of high - resolution _ chandra _ hetgs observations of this black hole x - ray binary ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , we found that states where the jet is quenched display strong , narrow , blueshifted absorption lines from a highly - ionized accretion disk wind ( see also ( * ? ? ? * miller et al .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that the strength of this wind is anticorrelated with the _ fractional _ hard x - ray flux , which is therefore a useful diagnostic of both the accretion state and outflow physics .",

    "* neilsen et al .  2010b ) ) using a joint _ rxte / chandra _ observation .",
    "through a combination of x - ray timing and both broadband and high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy , we show for the first time that changes in x - ray continuum on timescales of seconds ( as probed by _ rxte _ ) are associated with measurable changes in absorption lines ( _ chandra _ hetgs ) from the accretion disk wind ( fig .  1",

    "because the x - ray luminosity does not change enough to produce the observed ionization , the density of the disk wind must be modulated periodically on these timescales ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "in summary , our combined x - ray timing and spectral analysis probing timescales from 1 second to 10 years reveals new evidence for physical processes that connect the accretion disk , the radio jet , and the accretion disk wind . because the implied mass loss rate in the wind could be much higher than the accretion rate in the inner disk",
