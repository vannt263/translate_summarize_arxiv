    "the problem of the interplay of strong electronic correlations with electron  phonon interaction is of central importance in the physics of highly correlated systems . actually there is rather long history of such studies , e.g.",
    "one of the most popular models for electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) in strongly correlated systems is the so - called hubbard - holstein model ( hhm ) .",
    "the hubbard model@xcite itself describes local coulomb interaction of electrons on a lattice including e.g. mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition . on the other hand holstein model",
    "contains local linear displacement - to - density interaction of conducting electrons with local ( einstein ) phonon modes@xcite .",
    "active investigations of the properties of the hhm were undertaken in the framework of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , which is non - perturbative approach with respect to interaction parameters of the hubbard model . among many others",
    "one should mention dmft solution of hhm for the case where impurity solver used was the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) ( see for review of dmft(nrg ) applications ref .  ) .",
    "the mapping of hhm to anderson - holstein impurity was first performed by hewson and mayer@xcite .",
    "it was shown that using nrg one can compute in a numerically exact manner total electron - phonon contribution to the self - energy of the problem , thus making solution of the hhm non - perturbative also with respect to electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "one should note that self - consistent set of dmft equations is preserved in this approach .",
    "however , up to now there are apparently no studies of strongly correlated electrons interacting with debye phonons .",
    "it is even more surprising in view of the widely discussed physics of kinks in electronic dispersion observed in arpes experiments 40 - 70 mev below the fermi level of high - temperature superconductors@xcite , which are often attributed to epi @xcite . to our knowledge problem of kink formation on electronic dispersion caused by epi in strongly correlated systems",
    "was briefly discussed within hhm in papers by hague@xcite and koller  _ et al._@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report dmft+@xmath0 results for the hubbard model supplemented with debye phonons , assumung the validity of migdal theorem ( adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "we consider the influence of debye phonons on the weakly and strongly correlated electrons , studying electron dispersion and density of states ( dos ) , in particular close to mott - hubbard metal insulator transition . we analyze in details how epi affects electronic dispersions in correlated metal and discuss the interplay of recently discovered kinks of purely electronic nature in electronic dispersion @xcite and usual phonon kinks in the electronic spectra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce in sec .",
    "[ comp ] dmft+@xmath0 approach to the model at hand .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ results ] calculated results are presented and discussed .",
    "suumary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the major assumption of our dmft+@xmath0 approach is that the lattice and time fourier transform of the single - particle green function can be written as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bare electron dispersion , @xmath4 is the _ local _ self  energy of dmft , while @xmath5 is some `` external '' ( in general case momentum dependent ) self  energy .",
    "advantage of our generalized approach is the additive form of the self - energy ( neglect of interference ) in eq .",
    "( [ gk ] ) @xcite .",
    "it allows one to keep the set of self - consistent equations of standart dmft @xcite .",
    "however there are two distinctions .",
    "first , on each dmft iterations we recalculate corresponding `` external '' self - energy @xmath6)$ ] within some ( approximate ) scheme , taking into account interactions e.g. with collective modes ( phonons , magnons etc . ) or some order parameter fluctuations .",
    "second , the local green s function of effective impurity problem is defined as @xmath7 at each step of the standard dmft procedure .    eventually , we get the desired green function in the form of ( [ gk ] ) , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are those appearing at the end of our iteration procedure .    to treat electron - phonon interaction for strongly correlated system we just introduce @xmath8 due to electron ",
    "phonon interaction within the usual frhlich model . to solve single impurity anderson problem",
    "we use nrg@xcite .",
    "all calculations are done at nearly zero temperature and at half filling . for `` bare '' electrons we assume semielliptic dos with half ",
    "bandwidth @xmath9 .",
    "according to the migdal theorem in adiabatic approximation @xcite we can restrict ourselves with the simplest first order contribution to @xmath10 , shown by diagramm in fig .",
    "[ migdiag ] .     scheme .",
    "[ migdiag ] ]    the main advantage of this is possibility to neglect any order vertex corrections due electron - phonon coupling which are small over adiabatic parameter @xmath11 @xcite . contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ migdiag ] can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the usual electron - phonon interaction constant , @xmath14 is phonon dispersion , which in our case is taken as in the standard debye model @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the sound velocity and @xmath17 is debye frequency .",
    "actually @xmath18 defined by eq .",
    "( [ phse ] ) has weak momentum dependence which we can omit and continue only with significant frequency dependence . for the debye spectra ( [ dspec ] ) eq .",
    "( [ phse ] ) can be rewritten as ( cf .",
    "similar analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a characteristic frequency of the order of @xmath17 . for the case of semielliptic non - interacting dos @xmath23 with half - bandwidth @xmath9",
    "we get : @xmath24 it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant as@xcite : @xmath25 to simpilfy our analysis we shall not perform fully self - consistent calculations neglecting phonon renormalization due to epi@xcite , assuming that the phonon spectrum ( [ dspec ] ) is fixed by the experiment .",
    "let us start from comparison between pure dmft and dmft+@xmath1 doses for strong ( u/2d=1.25 ) and weak ( u/2d=0.625 ) hubbard interaction presented in fig .",
    "[ doses ] on upper and low panels correspondingly .",
    "dimensionless epi constant ( [ lambda ] ) used in these calculations was @xmath26=0.8 and debye frequency @xmath17=0.125d . in both cases",
    "we observe some spectral weight redistribution due to epi .",
    "( solid lines ) methods for strong ( upper panel , u/2d=1.25 ) and weak ( lower panel , @xmath270.625 ) hubbard interaction regimes .",
    "dimensionless electron ",
    "phonon coupling constant @xmath26=0.8 .",
    "[ doses ] ]    for u/2d=1.25 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ doses ] ) we see the well developed three peak structure typical for strongly correlated metals . in the energy interval @xmath28 around the fermi energy ( which is taken as zero energy at all figures below )",
    "there is almost no difference in the dos quasiparticle peak line shape obtained from pure dmft and dmft+@xmath1 .",
    "however outside this interval dmft+@xmath1 quasiparticle peak becomes significantly broader with spectral weight coming from hubbard bands .",
    "this broadening of dmft+@xmath1 quasiparticle peak leads as we show below to inhibiting of metal to insulator transition .",
    "in the case of u/2d=0.625 there are no clear hubbard bands formed but only some `` side wings '' are observed .",
    "spectral weight redistribution on the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ doses ] is not dramatic , though qualitatively different from the case of u/2d=1.25 .",
    "namely , main deviations between pure dmft and dmft+@xmath1 happen in the interval @xmath28 , where one can observe kind of `` cap '' in dmft+@xmath1 dos",
    ". corresponding spectral weight goes to the energies around @xmath29u , where hubbard bands are supposed to form .",
    "( solid lines ) methods close to metal - insulator transition ( from top - left to bottom right ) with @xmath26=0.8 . [ mitdoses ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ mitdoses ] we compare the behavior of pure dmft and dmft+@xmath1 doses for different u/2d values close to mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition . for u/2d=1.56",
    "both standard dmft and dmft+@xmath1 produce insulating solution .",
    "however there is some difference between these solutions .",
    "the dmft+@xmath1 hubbard bands are lower and broader than dmft ones because of additional interaction ( epi ) included .",
    "with decrease of u for u/2d=1.51 and 1.47 we observe that dmft+@xmath1 results correspond to metallic state ( with narrow quasiparticle peak at the fermi level ) , while conventional dmft still produces insulating solution . only around u/2d=1.43",
    "both dmft and dmft+@xmath1 results turn out to be metallic .",
    "overall doses lineshape is the same as discussed above .",
    "thus with increase of u finite",
    "epi slightly inhibits mott - hubbard transition from metallic to insulating phase .",
    "this result is similar to what was observed for the hhm in weak epi regime@xcite .    for more deep insight into these results",
    "let us analyze the structure of corresponding self - energies @xmath4 and @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ sigcomp ] we show both real and imaginary part of these self - energies .",
    "epi changes @xmath4 rather significantly ( see upper panel of fig .",
    "[ sigcomp ] ) .",
    "( dashed lines ) with self - energies renormalized by phonons and obtained within the dmft+@xmath1 approximation ( solid lines ) .",
    "lower panel  epi self - energies @xmath30 .",
    "black lines - real parts , red lines - imaginary parts .",
    "@xmath26=0.8 , u/2d=1.25 . [ sigcomp ] ]    at the same time in @xmath28 energy interval we find that slopes of real parts of both self - energies ( which determines quasiparticle weight in the fermi liquid theory ) are almost the same , while imaginary parts are very close to zero .",
    "thus quasiparticle peaks should be essentially identical in this region as we showed above ( fig .  [ doses ] ) . at",
    "energies higher than debye frequencies re@xmath4 goes steeper with respect to re(@xmath31 , making dmft qusiparticle peak in dos narrower above @xmath17 thus providing faster metal to insulator transition at @xmath26=0 . for the case of u/2d=0.625 ( not shown here ) pure dmft self - energy and",
    "those with the account of epi are nearly identical .",
    "corresponding @xmath1 is very close to that obtained due to phonons only and shown on lower panel of fig .",
    "[ sigcomp ] with dashed lines .",
    "it produces only the `` cap '' in the dos around the fermi level mentioned above .",
    "one can say also that such a `` cap''appears in dos when energy interval 2@xmath17 is much smaller than the quasiparticle peak width .",
    "now we address the issue of a sudden change of the slope of electronic dispersion , the so - called kinks .",
    "it is well known that interaction of electrons with some bosonic mode produces such a kink . in the case of epi typical kink energy",
    "is just the debye frequency @xmath17 .",
    "kinks of purely electronic nature were recently reported in ref .  .",
    "the energy of purely electronic kink as derived in ref .   for semielliptic bare dos is given by @xmath32 where d is the half of bare bandwidth and @xmath33 is fermi liquid quasiparticle weight .",
    "the rough estimate of @xmath34 is given by the half - width of quasiparticle peak of dos at its half - height .",
    "schematic pictures of kinks of both kinds close to the fermi level are shown in fig .",
    "[ kinksch ] .",
    " bare energy dispersion with no interactions included ; @xmath35 - dispersion around the fermi level with electron interaction included ; @xmath34 - electronic kink energy ; @xmath17 - phonon kink ( debye ) energy ; @xmath36 and @xmath37  shifts of dispersion due to pure electronic and phonon kinks .",
    "[ kinksch ] ]    electronic kink ( on the right side ) is rather `` round '' and usually hard to see .",
    "this kink is formed by the smaller slope connection of two splited branches with initial slope ( dashed line ) at energy @xmath38 . far away from the fermi level",
    "both of these branches return to the initial dispersion .",
    "in contrast the phonon kink produces rather sharp deviation from the initial dispersion at @xmath17 , but outside @xmath28 energy interval electron dispersion quickly returns to the initial one .",
    "our calculations clearly demonstrate that electronic kinks are hardly observable on the background of phonon kinks ( as e.g. on upper panel of fig .",
    "[ sigcomp ] ) , and special care should be taken to separate them by rather fine tuning of the parameters of our model .",
    "to clarify this situation we introduce an additional characteristic of the kink  the shift of electron dispersion in momentum space @xmath39 at kink energy . from simple geometry",
    "we estimate for phonon kinks @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the bare fermi velocity and @xmath26 was defined in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) . for electronic kink",
    "the similar estimate is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is quasiparticle weight in the case of absence of electronic kinks ( the same as @xmath44 defined in ref .  ) .",
    "velocity @xmath45 is the fermi velocity of initial dispersion , but it can not be just a bare one . as was reported in ref .",
    "electronic kinks can be observed only for rather strong hubbard interaction when three peak structure in the dos is well developed and electronic dispersion is strongly renormalized by correlation effects .",
    "this renormalization is determined by @xmath46 defined in eq .",
    "( [ dpph ] ) , which can be seen as kind of dimensionless interaction constant . in the case",
    "when both slopes on the fermi level and out of @xmath38 energy interval are equal there will be no electronic kink at all .",
    "now we can choose parameters of our model to make both kinks simultaneously visible .",
    "first of all one should take care that @xmath47 . for u/2d=1 with u=3.5",
    "ev we get @xmath480.1d and a reasonable value of debye frequency is @xmath490.01d . to make phonon kink pronounced at such relatively low debye frequency ( cf",
    "( [ dpph ] ) ) we have to increase epi constant .",
    "so we take @xmath26=2.0 .",
    "corresponding quasiparticle peaks of the dos together with re@xmath50 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigdos ] : at the left panel epi is switched off , while on the right panel it is switched on .",

    "on the right side of fig .",
    "[ sigdos ] , where epi is present , phonon kinks at @xmath28 are clearly visible and well separated in energy from electronic kink position .    to demonstrate coexistence of both these types of kinks we take a look on energy dispersion of simple cubic lattice with nearest neighbors transfers only .",
