    "the common trait of these optical lattice experiments consists in tunneling through potential barriers , which allows matter wave to coherently delocalize in space @xcite .",
    "a different approach to achieve coherent delocalization of matter waves is provided by discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqw ) . instead of continuous tunneling through barriers ,",
    "dtqws rely on the controlled motion of a quantum particle , which is rigidly shifted in discrete steps conditioned on its internal degree of freedom , constituting a pseudo spin-1/2 system .",

    "the two levels can be coupled by microwave radiation at @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , due to the different ac - polarizability of these hyperfine levels , a magic wavelength exists at @xmath6 that enables spin - dependent optical potentials @xcite : atoms in spin @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) state couple with light with @xmath9 right - handed ( @xmath2 left - handed ) circular polarization , yielding the following potentials : @xmath10\\}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad         u_\\downarrow(t ) = u^{(0)}_\\downarrow \\cos\\{2k_\\text{l}[x - x_\\downarrow(t)]\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the lattice depth that can be individually controlled in the experiment for both spin states , as well as the individual position @xmath12 of the two periodic potentials .    since we work in a deep optical lattice , such that tunneling between lattice sites is fully negligible , the trajectory of an atom in the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) state is determined by the motion of its @xmath9 ( @xmath2 ) sublattice . while in earlier experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ) the translation of each lattice potential was realized by an electro - optical retardation plate , we have recently developed a novel method , which synthesizes the state - dependent lattices from two independent @xmath9 and @xmath2 optical standing waves , see fig .",
    "[ aba : fig2 ] . the relative position between the two standing waves",
    "is controlled by an optoelectronic servo loop with a resolution on the order of @xmath13 and a bandwidth of approximately @xmath14 . the bandwidth is primarily limited by the finite response time of acousto - optic modulators , which are employed to stabilize the relative position of two sublattices .",
    "the state - dependent optical conveyor belt allows us to transport atoms arbitrarily over tens of lattice sites , as we demonstrated in one of our experiments falsifying classical trajectory theories @xcite ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : leggettgarg ] ) .",
    "discrete - time quantum walks are the quantum analog of random walks . in the classical world , the walker decides at discrete time steps whether to move one site leftward or rightward depending upon the result of tossing a coin  heads or tails . as shown in fig .  , a quantum walker , instead , is put at every time step in a coherent superposition of two internal states ( coin operation ) , and it is subsequently shifted by one lattice site in a direction subject to the spin state ( spin - dependent shift operation ) , e.g. , @xmath7 to the left and @xmath8 to the right .",
    "the coin operation is experimentally realized by using microwave radiation that resonantly couples the two hyperfine states .",
    "this allows us to achieve any arbitrary unitary transformation of the pseudo spin-1/2 with the coin operation . the most frequently used coin , however , is the hadamard coin , which produces an equal superposition of the two spin states ( coin angle equal to @xmath15 ) .",
    "the spin - dependent shift operation is realized by employing our conveyor belt transport technique , which moves the atom by one site rightward or leftward depending on the internal state . after applying both operations the trajectory of an atom",

    "furthermore , the quantum walk spreads ballistically with the number of time steps @xmath17 in contrast to a classic random walk , which spreads diffusively with a gaussian distribution of width @xmath18 .",

    "we investigated more than ten different physical decoherence mechanisms , which can be divided into two classes depending on whether they couple with the spin or positional degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the short horizontal lines in the figure represent the decoherence model of quantum walks , indicating a good agreement with the experimental data . with regard to the experimental data in fig .  ,",

    "we exploited the possibility of delocalizing atoms over tens of lattice sites to study the physics of a charged particle , for example an electron , in a periodic potential under the effect of an external homogeneous force . predicted by felix bloch nearly 90 years ago , the quantum particle in the lattice , instead of being indefinitely accelerated , performs periodic oscillations .",
    "we have shown experimentally that electric quantum walks do exhibit a similar behavior as bloch oscillations , where both sublattices are accelerated at each time step for a short time interval to reproduce the action of an external electric field @xcite . however , due to the time discreteness of the electric field operation ( sublattices acceleration ) , an even richer range of quantum transport regimes spanning from coherent delocalization to dynamical ( anderson - like ) localization has been predicted @xcite and observed .",
    "the superposition principle is one of the pillars of quantum theory , which goes beyond the classical concept of particles moving along well defined trajectories . to understand the motion of a quantum particle , instead",
    ", quantum theory takes into account all possible trajectories that the particle can take .",
    "this idea lies at the heart of the quantum path integral formalism @xcite .",
    "up until today it is an unresolved question how to reconcile the quantum mechanical worldview , where physical objects obey the unitary schrdinger equation , with the macro - realistic one , where objects are in one definite state at all times .",
    "for instance , the macroscopic apparatus of a stern - gerlach experiment always measures a definite orientation of the electron s spin , although the electron is , according to quantum mechanics , in a superposition of both spin orientations .",
    "to explain such a wave function reduction to a definite state , different ideas have been put forward , which can be coarsely divided into two groups @xcite : ( a ) interpretational solutions like , among others , the decoherence approach , bohmian mechanics , and many - worlds theory .",
    "( b ) objective collapse theories such as continuous spontaneous localization , and gravitational collapse theory .",
    "what distinguishes theories of type ( b ) is the assumption of an objective reduction of superposition states involving mechanical degrees of freedom ( i.e. , massive particles ) , which deviates from a schrdinger - type quantum dynamics @xcite .    in 1985",
    "leggett and garg ( lg ) derived an inequality relating correlation measurements performed at different times , providing an objective criterion to distinguish between quantum ( a ) and macro - realistic ( b ) theories  @xcite .",
    "the inequality is derived under two assumptions that embody the macro - realistic worldview , ( a1 ) macro - realism ( i.e. , massive particles follow classical trajectories ) and ( a2 ) non - invasive measurability ( i.e. , the position of a macroscopic object can be measured without perturbing its subsequent evolution ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the experimental violation of lg inequality falsifies a macro - realistic description of the studied phenomenon .",
    "our experimental apparatus offers an ideal platform to put classical trajectories theories of type ( b ) to the test , as we are capable of observing the position of a massive particle , namely an atom , moving through controlled trajectories in a one - dimensional optical lattice .    .",
    "only the position measurement at @xmath19 must be performed according to the ideal negative measurement protocol of fig .",
    "[ aba : fig6 ] .",
    "the measurement consists in spin selectively removing atoms in spin @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , atoms in spin @xmath0 are selectively removed ( not shown in the figure).,width=480 ]    the lg inequality binds the linear combinations of two - time correlation measurements according to @xmath20 where @xmath21 are measurements performed at three different times @xmath22 which are bound by @xmath23 , but can otherwise be freely defined .",
    "we aim to disprove macro - realistic interpretation of our dtqws by considering a four - step quantum walk as shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig6 ] , where we choose @xmath21 to be a function of the measured particle position @xmath24",
    "@xcite : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is position of the atom in units of lattice sites with respect to the initial position @xmath29 at time @xmath30 .",
    "note that at time @xmath19 we assign the same value regardless of the measured position .",
    "this is , in fact , entirely consistent with the lg inequality and helps remark the importance that a measurement is at all performed at time @xmath19 .",
    "this measurement also represents the most challenging aspect of an experimental violation of lg inequality . to avoid invalidating hypothesis ( a2 ) by experimental inadvertence , leggett and garg themselves introduced the idea of an ideal negative measurement protocol , which is consistent with the macro - realistic hypothesis ( a1 )",
    "the idea is based on a classical measurement protocol , which consists in performing an interaction - free measurement of position as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig5 ] . while from a macro - realistic perspective",
    ", ideal negative measurements are non - invasive ( hence , consistent with ( a2 ) ) , it is apparent that from a quantum mechanical point of view the measurement @xmath31 causes a projection of the wave function to a definite trajectory , which in turn conditions the subsequent motion .",
    "r2.4 in        in the experiment , the ideal negative measurement at time @xmath19 is implemented by selectively relocating atoms in , e.g , spin @xmath7 state so far away that they are effectively removed from the system .",
    "since position and spin after the first step ( time @xmath19 ) are perfectly correlated , a measurement of spin is equivalent to one of position .",
    "finding the particle at time @xmath32 allows us to infer its position at time @xmath19 ( in the example above : right site , @xmath8 ) .",
    "we also remark that the measurement at time @xmath32 does not need to be carried out with the ideal negative measurement protocol since the atom s evolution after @xmath32 is not relevant .",
    "experimentally , we performed ideal negative measurements utilizing a novel spin - dependent conveyor belt technique , which allows us to shift only one sublattice at a time over multiple lattice sites , while leaving the other at rest .    the measured probability distribution shown in fig .",
    "show distinct profiles depending on whether a measurement has been performed at time @xmath19 or not .",
    "this difference gives rise to a violation of lg inequality when the measured probability distributions are used to compute the correlation function @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lginequality ] ) quantum mechanically , it is also understood that the different outcome is related to the measurement process at @xmath19 , which in spite of being interaction - free , causes a projection of the wave function to a statistical mixture .",
    "[ aba : fig7 ] shows the value of @xmath33 as a function of the coin angle @xmath34 , which exhibits a maximal violation of @xmath35 for hadamard walk ( @xmath36 ) when the coin operation prepares an equal superposition of both spin states .",
    "only two particular walks ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) fulfill the lg inequality , since in these cases the coin operation creates no superposition states .",
    "although our test mass  the cesium atom  is unquestionably microscopic , this experiment represents the most macroscopic test of quantum superposition states based on the stringent criteria provided by the lg inequality .",
    "many regard the lg inequality as the gold standard to discern quantum superposition states , in like manner the bell inequality has become the widely accepted criterion to test non - locality .",
    "our experiment lays the groundwork for future tests with increasing `` macroscopicity '' @xcite that could shed light on quantum to classical transition .    .",

    "over the years , our quantum walk experiments have demonstrated a remarkable control of single quantum particles in optical lattices .",
    "the next frontier consists in exploring the motion of strongly correlated quantum particles @xcite .",
    "a necessary prerequisite for these experiments is that atoms must be cooled to the lowest three - dimensional ( 3d ) vibrational state of a single lattice site , in order to confine their motion to a very small volume and let them collide in a controllable way .",
    "after molasses cooling , our cesium atoms trapped in the optical lattice occupy different 3d vibrational quantum states , with a statistical occurrence given by the boltzmann distribution . yet",
    ", atoms can be subsequently prepared in the ground state by using resolved sideband cooling techniques to attain the 3d vibrational ground state @xcite . along the longitudinal direction of the optical lattice ,",
    "we reliably employ microwave sideband cooling  @xcite , which allows us to achieve a ground - state population of around @xmath40 starting from an initial population of around @xmath41 .",
    "sideband cooling , however , can not be directly employed in the transverse direction because of the weak transversal confinement with trap frequencies on the order of a few khz ( compared to the longitudinal trap frequency of @xmath42khz ) , which are on the same order or even smaller than the recoil frequency of a scattered photon ( @xmath43 for cs atoms ) .",
    "this corresponds to a lamb dicke parameter @xmath44 . to circumvent this problem we superimposed an additional blue - detuned hollow laser beam ( often referred to as `` doughnut beam '' ) with the one - dimensional optical lattice , which increases the transversal trap frequency up to @xmath45khz corresponding to @xmath46 .",

    "( b ) by adding a doughnut - shaped blue - detuned laser beam , atoms motion is transversally squeezed .",
    "the radius of the round shape is essentially limited by the @xmath47 optical resolution of the microscope s objective lens ( na=0.23).,width=336 ]    we use a single pair of raman beams ( one collinear with and the other perpendicular to the optical lattice ) to cool both transverse directions according to the raman cooling scheme in fig .  .",
    "in fact , we exploit a slight ellipticity ( on the percentage level ) of the doughnut trap to ensure motional coupling between the two transverse directions , so that the momentum transfer provided along a single direction by the raman transition suffices to cool the atomic motion in both transverse directions .",
    "shows an exemplary raman sideband spectrum , where the suppression of the first blues sideband demonstrates transverse ground state cooling of atoms . by analyzing the relative heights of the sideband peaks ,",
    "we infer a transversal ground - state population of 85% per direction , starting from an initial population of around @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to an overall 3d ground - state population of about 65% .",

    "we observe a reduced probability of collisional losses . ]",
    "the capability to control the position of individual cesium atoms with high fidelity combined with 3d ground state cooling gives us the possibility to study the motion of strongly interacting particles .",
    "in addition , our system provides an ideal platform to measure atomic properties such as the scattering length between different spin combinations using exactly two atoms .",
    "we carried out first experiments reporting on collisional losses due to inelastic collisions occurring at high two - atom densities . in previous experiments",
    "@xcite it was shown that a dense cloud of cesium atoms undergoes hyperfine state - changing collisions on a time scale of a minute for densities @xmath52 .",
    "our experimental apparatus allows us to achieve densities six orders of magnitude higher by transporting two 3d - cooled atoms into the same lattice site according to the scheme illustrated in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig10 ] .",
    "the energy released in the inelastic collision leads to losses of both atoms .",
    "by recording the occurrences at which both , one , or no atom remains in the optical lattice after a variable interaction time , we can extract the probability of inelastic collisional losses @xmath50 using a simple model : @xmath53          \\text{1 atom survives } = 2p(1-p)\\\\[1 mm ]          \\text{both atoms survive } = ( 1-p)^2 ( 1-{p_\\textrm{coll } } )      \\end{array }      \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is probability for a single atom to remain trapped in the optical lattice during the experimental sequence in the absence of collisions .",
    "independent measurements show that @xmath55 , which is mainly limited by technical reasons ( timing of the experimental sequence ) and additional losses experienced due to transverse cooling .",
    "experiments with tighter transverse confinement are expected to reach single - atom survival probabilities close to 99% .",
    "these preliminary results exhibit losses detectable already for interaction times on the ms scale , shown by the squares in fig .  .",
    "we can furthermore verify that the inelastic collision probability @xmath50 depends on the two - atom density .",
    "for that purpose , we excite the atom in @xmath7 with a spin - dependent shaking of the @xmath9 sublattice , which increases the volume of the atom s wave function .",
    "the reduced probability of collisional losses in this case is shown by the circle points in the same figure .",
    "ultracold atoms in the vibrational ground state of the lattice potential allow us to explore fascinating quantum - mechanical interference effects between two ( or more ) indistinguishable neutral atoms .",
    "quantum mechanics shows that quantum correlated states of two particles can be produced even if particles are non interacting .",
    "the most prominent example is provided by the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment @xcite .",
    "it demonstrated that two indistinguishable photons ( with identical polarization and transverse mode ) impinging simultaneously upon a beam splitter emerge in a quantum entangled state , where both photons exit from the beam splitter either through one or the other output port , but not from separate ones .",
    "the quantum correlation results from quantum interference of two - particle trajectories , and applies in general to any indistinguishable boson particles , including massive ones .",
    "recently , this effect has been observed in optical tweezers @xcite and atomic beams with bose - einstein condensates @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite in this conference proceedings ) .",
    "our experimental apparatus is ideally suited to implement a direct analog of the original hom experiment , thus demonstrating the essential building block to study correlated discrete - time quantum walks with indistinguishable particles .",
    "continuous - time analogues of dtqws with correlated boson particles have similarly been observed @xcite .    in our experimental realization of the atomic hom effect ,",
    "we initially prepare two atoms separated by 20 lattice sites , cool them into the 3d ground state , and transport them into the same lattice site using an adiabatic ramp ( see fig .  ) . instead of letting atoms interact on a ms time scale ( see sec .  [ ref : atomcollisions ] ) , we directly apply a microwave @xmath15 pulse ( see fig .  ) rotating the spin of both atoms onto the equator of the bloch sphere in a time ( @xmath56s ) much shorter than any other time scale . by subsequently displacing our sublattices",
    "spin dependently , we expect to produce the entangled noon state @xmath57 , as shown in fig .  .",
    "analogously to the original detection method @xcite , we provide experimental signature of the two - particle interference by recording the suppression of events where two atoms are detected at different lattice sites , corresponding to an anti - bunched state .",
    "ideally these events should not occur , yet they are detected in the experiment due to imperfect ground state cooling , which impairs the indistinguishability .",
    "in addition , our detection method does not allow a direct , unambiguous identification of all physical events due to technical reasons ( finite survival probability and imperfect efficiency of parity projection @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we need to resort to a monte carlo analysis of our results relying on experimental parameters measured independently .",
    "our analysis yields a signature of the hom interference with a statical significance of about @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , the monte carlo analysis confirms that the observed suppression of events with anti - bunched atoms is compatible with a 3d ground state population of around @xmath59 .",

    "one long - term goal consists in realizing quantum cellular automata of interacting , indistinguishable particles .",
    "the challenge for the future is to extend this technology from one - dimensional to two - dimensional lattices .",
