    "]    let us consider a @xmath160 cuboid magnet with magnetization @xmath161 along the @xmath41-axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : axes](a ) ) . as the magnetic field for a segment",
    "is analytically known , that for a rectangular coil is easy to calculate .",
    "introducing two auxiliary functions:@xmath162 the magnetic field for a current @xmath163 is @xmath164 with : @xmath165 integration along the @xmath15-axis can then be computed and the field for a rectangular solenoid reads : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a vector field whose coordinates are : @xmath168 in eq.[eqn : solenoidb ] , @xmath169 is the equivalent surface current density whose magnitude identifies with the magnetization @xmath170 for the considered cuboid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : axes ] ) .",
    "ndfeb is such a hard magnetic material that , in our case , @xmath171 can safely be taken equal to @xmath172 to get the desired magnetic field .",
    "a 3d magnetic probe was constructed using 3 honeywell ss495 hall effect sensors connected to a keithley datalogger .",
    "it was calibrated with a commercial 1d leybold probe .",
    "accuracy is estimated to be @xmath173 .",
    "measurements below the @xmath48 level should be considered carefully regarding the low sensitivity of the probe and difficulties in background subtraction .",
    "besides , the three components of the magnetic field are measured at different locations ( typically @xmath81 ) apart from each other due to sensors physical dimensions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : probe ] ) .",
    "this is the cause of some inaccuracy related to field gradients .",
    "the probe is guided in a plastic pipe passing through the zeeman slower .",
    "it is moreover attached to a flexible wire that winds around the axis of a stepper motor .",
    "when operated at a given frequency , the probe is smoothly translated and the magnetic field is recorded with a typical @xmath174 spatial resolution .",
    "assuming cylindrical symmetry , let @xmath175 denote the beam density at a distance @xmath176 from the center and @xmath177 the atomic velocity distribution .",
    "the atom flux is : @xmath178 for a probe beam at an angle @xmath40 from the atomic beam , the absorption signal @xmath124 is : @xmath179 where @xmath180 with @xmath181 is the absorption cross section . in the limit where the doppler broadening is much larger than the natural linewidth , @xmath182 , we can approximate the absorption cross section by a @xmath183-function : @xmath184 in that case eq .",
    "( [ eqn : adelta ] ) simplifies : @xmath185 and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phidelta ] ) gives : @xmath186 where @xmath133 is the typical atom beam diameter and @xmath187 a constant near unity defined according to : @xmath188 for a homogeneous cylindrical beam @xmath189 .",
    "the atom flux is thus measured from the absorption signal by numerical integration following eq .",
    "( [ eqn : flux ] ) .",
    "the atomic beam is created by an effusive oven loaded with 15  g of rubidium . in order",
    "to maximise the oven lifetime , we use a recirculating design . as compared to the so - called ` candlestick '",
    "designs,@xcite our oven , inspired in part by ref .",
    "is very simple and easy to operate .",
    "we have built several versions of the oven over the last five years , with minor variations between them , and observed comparable performances .",
    "the same design has been used also for a sodium bec setup producing extremely large condensates@xcite but no detailed description is given there .        a general view of the oven , made of standard cf-16 and cf-40 ultra - high vacuum fittings , is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : oven ] .",
    "a first chamber contains , at the bottom , molten rubidium kept at temperature @xmath190 , in equilibrium with rubidium vapor , which effuses through a circular aperture of diameter @xmath191  mm drilled in the center of a blank cf-16 copper gasket .",
    "the other parts of the chamber are kept at @xmath192  k in order to avoid the accumulation of rubidium on a cold spot and possible clogging of the oven aperture .",
    "the temperatures @xmath190 to @xmath193 are actively stabilized by means of four pid controllers , thermocouples as temperature sensors , and heating bands as actuators . to achieve a good thermal insulation , the oven",
    "is covered with two layers of alkaline earth silicate wool and an external foil of metal coated mylar . in steady state ,",
    "the average power consumption is a few tens of watts . a second chamber ( made of a conical cf-16 to cf-40 adapter )",
    "is used to collimate the beam by means of a second aperture ( diameter @xmath194  mm ) located 80 mm downstream .",
    "the rubidium not used in the collimated beam accumulates into this chamber .",
    "liquid rubidium at temperature @xmath195 flows back by gravity to the first chamber through a 6  mm inner diameter stainless steel tube . a piece of gold - plated stainless steel mesh ( alfa - aeser ref .",
    "42011 ) covers the inside of the recirculating chamber to ease the accumulation of rubidium in its lower part .",
    "the loading of the oven is made in a very simple way : we cool down the rubidium ampule(s ) in liquid nitrogen , break the glass with pliers , and insert the ampules upside down into the first oven chamber .",
    "we then close this chamber with a blank cf-16 flange , and pump down the oven to @xmath196  mbar with a turbomolecular pump .",
    "when heating the oven , the rubidium melts and drips to the bottom of the first chamber .",
    "it is not easy to obtain a definitive proof that the rubidium does recirculate in the oven .",
    "however we have been running two ovens for several years , either at moderate or high flux.@xcite in both cases , we did not observe any decrease in the atom flux after 45 times the estimated lifetime of the initial load of rubidium assuming operation in the effusive regime.@xcite",
