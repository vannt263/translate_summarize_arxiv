    "dwarf novae ( hereafter dne ) are cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) characterized by periodic outbursts , lasting few days , followed by longer periods of quiescence lasting from few weeks to several months .",
    "these outbursts ( see cannizzo 1993 and references therein ) are originated by cyclic instabilities in the accretion disk surrounding a hot white dwarf ( wd ) or subdwarf .",
    "z cam stars form a subclass of dne in the sense that they are characterized by outburst ` standstills ' ( see warner 1995 ) , i.e. by prolonged phases in which their luminosity is halfway between maximum and quiescence . according to osaki ( 1996 ) , in these systems",
    "the mass transfer rate from the secondary is very close to the limit at which the accretion rate from the secondary ceases to trigger periodic instability episodes in the accretion disk and maintains the disk in a stable state ( frank et al .",
    "according to the observations , z cam stars are above the period gap ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "v1101 aql is listed in the _ general catalog of variable stars _ ( kholopov 1987 ) as an irregular variable , although richter ( 1961 ) stated that this object was an rr lyr star . on the contrary , meinunger ( 1965 ) , vogt & bateson ( 1982 ) and",
    "downes & shara ( 1993 ) classified it as a z cam - type dn .",
    "this would be confirmed by the observations of pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) , which noticed that the star shows an ultraviolet excess , generally varies in the @xmath0 band between magnitudes 13.8 and 14.8 and has ` algol  like fadings ' down to magnitude @xmath5 ( these might possibly be observations made during the quiescent phase ) . actually , they classified v1101 aql as a cv .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by downes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from the analysis of spectra acquired on september 1992 and on august 1994 , when the object was at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "however , it should be noted that the latter authors find some spectral similarities between v1101 aql and the class of herbig ae / be stars .    in this paper",
    "we present high  time resolution photometry of v1101 aql obtained on september 1993 and on july 1996 , together with a spectrum secured on june 1996 .",
    "section 2 will describe the employed instruments and the reduction techniques , sect .",
    "3 will analyse the spectrophotometric data and sect . 4",
    "will discuss the results .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "5 will draw our conclusions .",
    "the images of v1101 aql are divided into two data sets .",
    "the first one has been acquired on september 10 , 1993 with the 0.9 m dutch telescope at la silla .",
    "this run was composed of 71 @xmath1 and 3 @xmath0 frames .",
    "the second data set was obtained on july 13 and 14 , 1996 with the 1.2 m telescope of the asiago astrophysical observatory : here , 58 @xmath1 , 2 @xmath0 and 2 @xmath2 frames were collected .",

    "magnitude calibration was performed using the secondary photometric sequence ( stars 2 , 5 , 6 and 7 ) established by misselt ( 1996 ) .",
    "the typical error on photometry is @xmath100.02 mag .",
    "the internal magnitude differences of the comparison stars were nearly constant within the errors ( see fig .",
    "3a , b ) : this confirms that only v1101 aql is responsible for the observed variability .",
    "the observation times at mid  exposure were then converted to heliocentric julian days for each magnitude measurement .",
    "a single spectrum of the system was taken on june 9 , 1996 with the 1.80 m telescope of the asiago observatory , equipped with a 300 grooves mm@xmath11 grating , ( wavelength range : 35006000  ) , and a slit width of 2 \" ( resolution of 4.3  / pixel ) .",
    "this spectrum was extracted and reduced with iraf , and calibrated in wavelength with a fe  ar lamp .",
    "flux calibration was performed with the spectroscopic standard feige 92 .",
    "on september 10 , 1993 , the mean @xmath1 magnitude of the star was 14.49 , whereas on july 1996 , it was @xmath12@xmath1@xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 color index remained constant , being 0.28 on september 1993 and 0.29 on july 1996 ; the @xmath15 was 0.16 on the night of july 13 , 1996 .",
    "the search for periodic light variations in the @xmath1 band has been performed with a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) algorithm .    to reduce the noise in the dft power spectrum",
    ", we have shifted the data points to a common magnitude level , computed by using the mean magnitude for each night .",
    "this could appear somewhat arbitrary , but is suggested by the fact that we are able to determine the mean luminosity of v1101 aql in both parts of the observing run since we observed the object for more than one orbital cycle ( see below ) during each night .",
    "the dft power spectrum of the @xmath1 data points ( fig .",
    "1a ) shows a series of peaks , the most prominent being at @xmath167 cycles day@xmath11 ( = 0.144193 days , or 3@xmath4.46 ) , with a slight prevalence on its one  day alias at @xmath166 cycles day@xmath11 ( = 0.166809 days , or 4@xmath4.00 ) .",
    "all the peaks belong to the same family of one  day aliases and are therefore produced by the sampling of one single real periodicity of the @xmath1 lightcurve .",
    "we therefore applied the clean algorithm ( roberts et al .",
    "1987 ) to discriminate the modulation responsible for producing the alias series .",
    "the results of this analysis , reported in fig .",
    "1b , suggest as real period the 3@xmath4.46 modulation . as a further check",
    ", we subtracted this periodicity with appropriate amplitude and phase to the @xmath1 data set and computed a new dft ( fig .",
    "2a ) : its power spectrum peaks at @xmath167 cycles day@xmath11 , but the power of the peak is lower than that of fig . 1a .",
    "we followed the same procedure using the 4@xmath4.00 modulation ( fig .",
    "2b ) : in this case , the dft power spectrum is the same of fig . 1a",
    "but the peaks had their spectral power doubled .",
    "finally , we applied two least squares best  fit methods to the @xmath1 data points , i.e. the sterken s ( 1977 ) and the schneich ",
    "lange s ( 1981 ) algorithms , and both methods indicate as best fit the periodicity at 0.144 days .",
    "the @xmath1 lightcurves folded with the 3@xmath4.46 and 4@xmath4.00 are shown in fig .",
    "3a , b , respectively .",
    "all the images taken at la silla under photometric conditions ( seeing @xmath171\".5 ) seem to reveal around v1101 aql the presence of an asymmetric nebulosity , best seen in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "4a ) rather than in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "this feature was not detected in the frames obtained on july 1997 frames due to poor seeing conditions .    to better disentangle the faint nebulosity from the background , we have designed , through daophot ii , the average psf using nearby field stars , and",
    "then we have subtracted it to the image of v1101 aql .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "5a , b : an underlying bow  shaped nebulosity is visible in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "5a ) and in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "5b ) .      the spectrum secured on june 9 , 1996 , is shown in fig",
    ". 6 . we can notice the balmer lines in absorption with a small emission core and , perhaps , the presence of a noisy emission of he ii at 4686  . fluxes and ew s of these lines are reported in table 2 .",
    "h@xmath18 is outside the spectral range as well as the absorption lines and bands of the secondary , possibly present at longer wavelengths .    the nad interstellar absorption at 5890   is also present .",
    "this line might be possibly contamined by the presence of he i @xmath195876 in absorption ; a double gaussian fit yields ew@xmath20  , which corresponds , according to the relation by barbon et al . ( 1990 ) , to a @xmath21 mag . this value is higher than that ( @xmath220.1 mag ) found by pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) using the ( @xmath23)/(@xmath14 ) color ratio .",

    "we can interpret the modulation in the @xmath1 lightcurve of v1101 aql as due to the orbital motion of the secondary star around the hot wd ( see warner 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the uv illumination from the disk and the wd heats the inner face of the secondary and makes it brighter than the other side .",
    "this , combined with the orbital motion , produces a sinusoidal lightcurve with the maximum in correspondence of the superior conjunction of the secondary .",
    "the small amplitude of the modulation also indicates that eclipses are absent , and thus that the inclination of the system must be small .",
    "the periodic variation of @xmath163@xmath4.5 is consistent with the mean orbital period of z cam stars , which is always more than 3 hours ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "dne with these periods have early  mid m type secondaries ( ritter & kolb 1995 ) with masses around 0.30.4 @xmath24 .",
    "this orbital period determination can also lead us to attempt an estimate of the absolute magnitude m@xmath25 of the system and hence its distance . according to warner ( 1995 ) ,",
    "z cam dne with orbital periods around 3@xmath4.5 should have m@xmath26 ( 1@xmath27 ) at standstill .",
    "if v1101 aql has , at standstill , @xmath28 , ( we assume the magnitude at quiescence to be @xmath29 ; see pastukhova & shugarov 1994 ) we derive , after taking into account the interstellar absorption in the @xmath1 band , a distance of @xmath30 pc .",
    "this value is about one half the previous estimate given by pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) and , together with the galactic latitude @xmath31 , implies a height on the galactic plane @xmath32 pc .      the spectrum presented in fig .",
    "6 shows the presence of absorption balmer lines filled in with emissions , thus supporting , in agreement with pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) , that this system might be a cv .",
    "concerning the asymmetric nebulosity around v1101 aql , we note that it is more visible in @xmath1 than in @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "actually , simple aperture photometry gives @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the total angular size of the nebulosity is @xmath166 arcsecs ; this , together with our distance estimate , leads to a linear size of @xmath2210@xmath35 cm .",
    "we observed long  term variations of v1101 aql in @xmath1 magnitude , very likely triggered by disk activity .",
    "we have detected @xmath36.46 as possible orbital period of v1101 aql , with an important alias at 4@xmath4.00 .",
    "the secondary of a dn with such an orbital period should have m@xmath37 ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath1 emission of the uv  heated secondary star is about 25 times lower than that of the whole system ; i.e. , any variation coming from the secondary could modify the total @xmath1 luminosity of the system by a factor @xmath171/25 at most , corresponding to a full amplitude fluctuation of @xmath170.04 mag .",
    "this is smaller than the amplitude ( @xmath160.1 mag ) of the modulation in fig .",
    "3a , b , then indicating an extra contribution of @xmath160.06 mag due to the uv heating of the inner face of the secondary .    the discovery of a z cam ",
    "type dn with an orbital period just above to the 3hr upper limit of the period gap of cvs is consistent with the presence of a sharp ` luminosity bump ' , in the period  absolute magnitude plane of cvs between 3 and 3.5 hr as suggested by zangrilli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    our results",
    "then , complemented with data gathered from literature , allow us to set the standstill magnitude of this z cam star close to @xmath28 and to estimate for this system a distance of about 300 pc .",
    "the spectrum , taken during standstill , seems to confirm the cataclysmic binary nature of v1101 aql , though the discovery of an asymmetric nebulosity , which seems to be associated to the object , does not rule out the possibility , already pointed out by downes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , that v1101 aql could be a herbig ae / be star rather than a cv . in this case , the presence of an associate nebulosity around the object is fully consistent with such a classification .",
    "however , due to the relatively poor seeing conditions ( @xmath161\".5 ) , we can not rule out that the image of v1101 aql has been contamined by a background object .",
