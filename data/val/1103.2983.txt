    "in this paper we study bilocal sums of spin spherical harmonics @xcite ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : ssh ] below for more details ) .",
    "such expressions occur in the computation of physical observables in systems undergoing dynamical transitions induced by rotationally invariant spin - dependent interactions . expanding the states",
    "involved in such transitions in a basis of total angular - momentum eigenfunctions leads to the sums considered here . in quantum systems , partial - wave expansions of transition amplitudes , or other matrix elements , are given by addition theorems for spin spherical harmonics .",
    "another example is provided by multipolar expansions of the classical electromagnetic radiation field @xcite in quadratic observables like energy , energy flow , or radiated power , which lead in some cases to bilocal sums of vector spherical harmonics .",
    "our main motivation for the present paper is the application of its results to the partial - wave analysis of scattering processes . in that context ,",
    "partial waves satisfying two - body unitarity play an essential role in the theoretical approach ( see @xcite for a realistic application to hadronic reactions and an extensive reference list ) .",
    "two - body intermediate states with different spins must be included in the analysis in order to satisfy unitarity , both as genuine asymptotic states or , in the case of resonances , as an approximation to higher @xmath4-body intermediate states .",
    "the addition theorems we consider in this paper are then needed for a systematic approach to partial - wave expansions of @xmath5-matrix elements between states involving particles with different spins .",
    "for that reason , we expect the results given below to be of interest also in other fields where quantum scattering is relevant .",
    "more generally , however , given the ubiquitous applications of spherical harmonics in all areas of physics as solutions to the laplace equation , we hope the addition theorems discussed here to be of interest by themselves , independently of our specific motivations .",
    "our discussion of bilocal sums of spin spherical harmonics in the following sections is entirely based on results from the first part of this paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as i. we refer to equations and sections of the first part by prefixing their numbers with i. the matrix elements obtained in sect .",
    "i.[i.sec : proj ] are restated below as bilocal sums of ordinary spherical harmonics .",
    "in particular , they provide an explicit general expression for bilocal spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "the results of sect.i.[i.sec : proj ] also lead to a completely general addition theorem for , and to some classes of bilocal sums of , one scalar and one rank-@xmath4 tensor spherical harmonic for any @xmath6 . using the results of sects .",
    "i.[i.sec : fac ] and i.[i.sec : proj ] , we obtain below a general addition theorem for two spin spherical harmonics with spins @xmath7 , and discuss it in completely explicit form in the cases @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "our approach can easily be applied to higher - spin spherical harmonics , although for @xmath10 the size of the resulting algebraic expressions grows rapidly with @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the definition and main properties of spin-@xmath1 spherical harmonics , for any integer or half - integer @xmath1 . in section [ sec:2scalar ] we study bilocal sums of ordinary spherical harmonics , including bilocal spherical harmonics . in section [ sec : scalspin ]",
