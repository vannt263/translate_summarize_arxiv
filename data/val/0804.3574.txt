    "ngc6266 ( m62 ) is one of the most massive and brightest ( @xmath4 ; harris 1996 ) galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , also is characterized by high values of the central density ( log @xmath5 , with @xmath6 in units of @xmath7pc@xmath8 ; beccari et al .",
    "it displays a king - model density profile with an extended core ( @xmath9 ) and a modest value of the concentration parameter ( @xmath10 ; beccari et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "six binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) have been discovered in m62 ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ; jacoby et al . 2002 ; possenti et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter p03 ) and it ranks fifth of the gcs in wealth of msps , after terzan 5 , 47 tucanae , m15 and m28 .",
    "p03 presented phase  connected timing solutions , yielding precise celestial coordinates , for three of the msps in ngc6266 .",
    "one of them , psrj1701@xmath03006b ( hereafter psr6266b ) displays partial or total eclipses of the radio signal at 1.4 ghz near its superior conjunction ( in the convection adopted throughout this paper , this corresponds to orbital phase @xmath11 ) , clearly due to gas streaming off the companion .",
    "the pulsar orbit is circular , with a projected semi - major axis of only @xmath12 .",
    "p03 suggested two options for explaining the behaviour of the psr6266b system .",
    "the first option is that the pulsar companion is a non - degenerate bloated star , whose mass loss is sustained by ablation of its loosely bound surface layers by the relativistic wind emitted by the pulsar . in this case",
    ", psr6266b may resemble psrs b1957 + 20 ( fruchter et al . 1990 ) and j2051@xmath00827 ( stappers et al .",
    "2001 ) : the optical light curve of their companion star presents a maximum when the side of the companion facing the pulsar points toward the observer ( i.e. , at the pulsar inferior conjunction : @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is a clear signature of the irradiation of the companion surface by the pulsar flux .",
    "the second option has the pulsar companion as a tidally deformed star overflowing its roche lobe due to the internal nuclear evolution . in this case",
    ", the system may be more like psrj1740@xmath05340 ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ; ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) , where irradiation effects are negligible ( orosz & van kerkwijk 2003 ) and the optical light curve of the companion is dominated by ellipsoidal variations ( ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) , i.e. it shows two maxima at quadratures ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "we present the optical identification of the companion to psr6266b , based on high - quality phase - resolved photometry obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , and x - ray emission detected with _ chandra _ .",
    "hst observations .",
    "the photometric data presented here consist of a set of high - resolution images obtained on august 1 2004 by using the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) , on - board the hst , and retrieved from the _ eso / st - ecf science archive_. the data comprise three @xmath16-band exposures ( @xmath17s and @xmath18s exposures ) , two @xmath19-band exposures ( of 120 and 340s ) and four @xmath20-band exposures ( of 340 , 1050 , 1125 , 1095s ) .",
    "the three longest exposures in @xmath20 are the combination of three sub - exposures .",
    "an additional set of wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 , prop .",
    "10845 , pi : ferraro ) data has been secured through the @xmath20 filter with the specific aim of testing the possible variability of the companion : ten 1200s exposures were taken between may 2 and may 5 2007 . in order to best resolve stars in the most crowded regions , the planetary camera ( with a resolution of @xmath21pixel ) of the wfpc2 was pointed at the cluster center .",
    "the photometric analysis of the acs dataset has been carried out using the acs module of the dolphot package @xcite , using the flt.fits datasets for the photometry , and the drizzled images as references for the geometric distortion correction .",
    "we set the photometry parameters as recommended in the dolphot manual , obtaining a final catalog of @xmath19 , @xmath16 and @xmath20 magnitudes , calibrated according to sirianni et al .",
    "the final catalog is reported to an absolute astrometric system by cross - correlating the stars in common with the data set of beccari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which has been astrometrized by using the standard stars from the new _ guide star catalog ii _ ( @xmath22 ) lying in the considered field of view ( fov ) . at the end of the procedure ,",
    "the rms residuals were of the order of @xmath23 both in ra and dec ; we assume this value as representative of the astrometric accuracy .    in order to carefully search for any variability from the msp companion , we reanalyzed the @xmath20 images in a small area around the nominal position of psr6266b by using romafot ( buonanno et al . 1983 ) .",
    "this package has been specifically developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded fields , and it also allows a visual inspection of the quality of the psf - fitting procedure . in particular , we extracted @xmath24-pixels ( @xmath25 ) sub - images from the ten original @xmath20 acs frames , each centered on the nominal position of psr6266b . in order to optimize the detection of faint objects , we performed the search procedure on the median image .",
    "then , we adopted the resulting mask with the star positions to the individual sub - images , and performed the psf - fitting procedure separately on each of them .",
    "we adopted the same strategy for the analysis of the nine wfpc2 @xmath20 images , after the careful alignement with the previously astrometrized acs frames .",
    "the resulting instrumental magnitudes were transformed to a common system , and we compiled a final catalog with coordinates and magnitudes for all the stars identified in the considered 19 sub - images .",
    "the photometric calibration of the instrumental magnitudes and the absolute celestial coordinates were determined by using all the stars in common with the overall acs catalog , calibrated and astrometrized as discussed above .",
    "chandra observations .",
    "ngc6266 was observed for 63 ks on may 2002 with the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the acis - s3 chip was pointed at the cluster center , its fov ( @xmath26 ) entirely covering the half - mass radius ( @xmath27 ; harris 1996 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the ciao software ( v. 3.3.0 ) , reprocessing the level 1 event files ; the task acis_run_hotpix was used to generate a new badpixel file .",
    "then we applied the corrections for pixels randomization , good time intervals and grades .",
    "our analysis includes only photons with asca grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 .",
    "about 1.5 ks of observations were not considered in the analysis because of the high background level .",
    "we searched for discrete sources in our level 2 event file using wavdetect ( freeman et al . 2002 ) , performing the source detection separetely on the 0.2 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 8 , and 0.2 - 8 kev bands .",
    "the detection threshold was set to @xmath28 , and the source detection was performed increasing the sequence of wavelets from 1 to 16 by factors of @xmath29 .",
    "more than 110 sources were detected in the 0.2 - 8 kev band in the entire chip .",
    "the astrometry of all the detected sources was corrected by using the aspect calculator provided by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center .",
    "then we searched for possible optical counterparts both in our hst images and catalog .",
    "about 5 bright stars and 2 faint and extended objects ( likely background galaxies ) were found to coincide with the x - ray sources well outside the half - mass radius , where the stellar density is relatively low .",
    "we therefore used these optical counterparts for extending the astrometric solution of hst to the _ chandra _ sources , thus obtaining the same accuracy in the absolute astrometry for both the optical and the x - ray sources .",
    "figure [ fig : chart ] shows the @xmath30 wfpc2 @xmath20 map centered on the psr6266b nominal position ( marked with a _ cross _ ) , as derived from timing ( see p03 ) .",
    "an accurate photometric analysis has been carried out for all the @xmath31 stars found in our catalog within a distance of @xmath32 from the psr6266b position .",
    "this correspond to 3 times the @xmath33 uncertainty ( @xmath34 ) in the absolute astrometry of the hst data .",
    "in particular , we have extracted 19 individual images from our dataset ( 10 exposures with acs and 9 with wfpc2 ) and compared the resulting magnitudes for each object in order to search for variability and estimate the typical photometric uncertainties at different magnitude levels .",
    "only one source in the catalog ( hereafter named com6266b , marked with a small circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] ) showed @xmath20 variability ( @xmath35 mag ) significantly larger than the typical rms magnitude fluctuations of stars of similar luminosity ( @xmath36 mag in acs data , and @xmath37 mag in wfpc2 data ) .",
    "its celestial coordinates are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , whereas the mean apparent magnitudes are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is from beccari et al .",
    "it is located at @xmath45 from psr6266b just at the edge of its positional error circle .",
    "figure [ fig : cmds ] reports the @xmath46 and @xmath47 color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for all the stars detected in the @xmath48 box centered on the psr6266b nominal position .",
    "com6266b is marked with a _",
    "large filled triangle _ in both the cmds . as apparent from the figure ,",
    "the star has almost the same luminosity of the cluster turn off , but it shows an anomalous red color which locates it out of the main sequence .",
    "the photometric properties imply that it is not a degenerate star and that it has a moderate @xmath20 excess , indicating the presence of ionized gas surrounding the system",
    ". these findings are consistent with the irregulaties seen in the radio signal of psr6266b and supports the scenario that com6266b is a mass losing star .    in order to firmly assess the physical connection between com6266b and the binary pulsar psr6266b , we have accurately investigated the time scale of the optical variability ) west in the acs map ( see fig.[fig : chart ] ) .",
    "this object turns out to be a normal sub - giant branch star , slightly brighter ( @xmath49 mag in @xmath19 , @xmath16 and @xmath20 ) than com6266b and not displaying any evidence of variability .",
    "although very close to each other , the two stars are clearly separable in the high resolution acs and wfpc2 images and we have verified that the photometric analysis of com6266b is not affected by the presence of this close star . ] ( in the 0 - 1 day range ) .",
    "the @xmath20 time series ( 19 points ) was processed using the gratis @xmath50 fitting routine , a code developed at the bologna astronomical observatory in order to study the periodicity of variable stars ( see , e.g. , clementini et al .",
    "following the procedure fully described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the most significant ( 99% confidence interval ) of the fourier time series fit ( at different modulation periods ) to the @xmath20 data ( see for example figure 2 of ferraro et al .",
    "periodicity was found at a period of @xmath51 day , consistent , within the uncertainties , with the orbital period of psr6266b derived from timing ( @xmath52 day , where the figure in parenthesis is the uncertainty , at 99% confidence level , on the last quoted digit ; p03 ) .",
    "given that , we have folded the 19 magnitude values , by using @xmath53 and the reference epoch of the psr6266b radio ephemeris ( @xmath54 ; p03 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : lc ] .",
    "as apparent , the acs and the wfpc2 data ( obtained about 3 years later ) agree with each other , drawing a well defined light curve with two distinct maxima at about @xmath14 and @xmath55 this fact , as well as the phases and the amplitudes of the minima , confirms that the optical modulation is associated with the pulsar binary motion and strongly suggests that com6266b is a deformed star overflowing its roche lobe ( see  1 ) .",
    "additional properties of this system can be derived from the analysis of the _ chandra _ data .",
    "we found an x  ray source located at only @xmath56 from com6266b and at @xmath57 from the nominal radio position of psr6266b .",
    "the derived coordinates of the x - ray source are @xmath58 and @xmath59 and the @xmath33 uncertainty area on its position is encircled in fig.[fig : chart ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "given the number of sources ( 50 ) detected within the half - mass radius of ngc6266 , the probability of a chance superposition of a x  ray source within @xmath57 from the radio position of psr6266b is @xmath60 strongly supporting the association of the detected source with the psr6266b system .",
    "the ( background substracted ) photons counts are @xmath61 ( soft : 0.21 kev ) , @xmath62 ( medium : 12 kev ) and @xmath63 ( hard : 28 kev ) , implying hr1@xmath64 and hr2@xmath65 ( where hr1=medium / soft counts and hr2=hard / medium counts ) .",
    "hence the source is harder than the typical msp population observed in gcs ( e.g. grindlay et al .",
    "2002 ) and the hr1 , hr2 values resemble those of a source in which the pulsar wind shocks the material released from the companion ( see , e.g. , the cases of psrj1740@xmath05340 in ngc6397 , and psrj0024@xmath07204w in 47tuc ; grindlay et al . 2002 , and bogdanov et al . 2005 , respectively ) . even if the small number of photons prevents a detailed spectral analysis , for an absorption column density @xmath66 ( pooley et al .",
    "2003 ) , the counts in each band and the hr1 and hr2 values are consistent with a power law model having a photon index @xmath67 , and a total unabsorbed flux @xmath68 in the 0.2 - 8 kev band , translating ( for a distance of 6.6kpc ; beccari et al .",
    "2006 ) into a x  ray luminosity of @xmath69 .",
    "many observed features of com6266b ( namely , its anomalous red colour , the @xmath20 excess , the shape of the light curve , the x - ray emission from the binary ) are suggestive of a tidally deformed star which is experiencing heavy mass loss , similar to the system found in ngc6397 by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . on the other hand , other photometric properties of the source",
    "do not fit this picture , as described below .    by assuming the reddening @xmath70 and the distance quoted by beccari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and adopting @xmath71=-1.1 $ ] and an age of 12 gyr for ngc6266 , we have determined the physical parameters of com6266b from the comparison of its position on the cmds ( fig.[fig : cmds ] ) with the isochrones of pietrinferni et al .",
    ". the resulting effective temperature , bolometric luminosity and radius of this star are @xmath72k , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , where the quoted uncertainties are conservative estimates , essentially due to the uncertanties in the distance modulus ( @xmath75 mag ) and in the reddening ( @xmath76 mag ) .",
    "if the luminosity variations shown in fig .  [ fig : lc ] are mainly due to tidal deformations of the companion star , the stellar radius @xmath16 is expected to be of the order of the roche lobe radius @xmath77 .",
    "the latter can be estimated from the mass function and the projected semi - major axis of psr6266b ( derived from pulsar timing ; p03 ) , provided that a pulsar mass @xmath78 and an orbital inclination @xmath79 are assumed . as already discussed in p03 ,",
    "the presence of radio eclipses indicates that @xmath79 is not small . conservatively taking @xmath80 and assuming @xmath81 , the companion star is expected to span a mass interval ranging from @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) to @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "] , corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is only slightly affected by the choice of @xmath88 being , for instance , @xmath89 for @xmath90 ( a safely large neutron star mass range ; see , e.g. , freire et al .",
    "note that in order to match the estimated @xmath77 with the observed @xmath16 it should be @xmath91 ( for @xmath92 ) , thus implying an unreliable companion mass of @xmath93 . in summary , for all plausible binary parameters , it turns out that the observed stellar radius of com6266b is significantly larger ( @xmath94 ) than the expected roche lobe radius of the companion to psr6266b , i.e. com6266b appears @xmath95 times brighter than the expected luminosity of any pulsar companion having an effective temperature @xmath96      _ ( i ) _ the binary system could not belong to the cluster . in this case the adopted distance would be inappropriate and the value of the radius deduced from the luminosity would be largely overestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "the celestial position of psr6266b is at less than @xmath97 from the cluster center , and the pulsar shows a negative value of the spin period derivative , as expected if psr6266b lies in the cluster potential well .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ the optical luminosity of com6266b could be dominated by strong non - thermal processes , possibly triggered by the pulsar spin down power @xmath98 ( see p03 ) .",
    "also in this case the value of the stellar radius deduced from the observed luminosity could be significantly overestimated . however , at the orbital separation of @xmath99 , the energy captured by a roche lobe filling companion would be of the order of @xmath100 which is too low to explain the observed value .",
    "moreover , it is hard to explain how a large non - thermal component may generate a light curve with maxima that fall at orbital phases nicely consistent with those expected for light curves modulated by ellipsoidal variations .    _",
    "com6266b could be the blend of two low - luminosity stars : one star would be the optically variable companion to psr6266b and the other one a non - variable star in the foreground ( background ) .",
    "while stellar blends are not uncommon in the highly crowded gc cores , this possibility only partially alleviates the problem .",
    "in fact , by assuming that com6266b is the blend of two stars of equal mean @xmath20 magnitude ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) , the observed ellipsoidal modulation could only be produced if the pulsar companion varies by @xmath102 mag , which is a rather extreme value for variabilities induced by tidal distortions . moreover , even in this case , the star would have a radius @xmath103 .",
    "matching @xmath16 with @xmath77 would require that com6266b is e.g. the blend of a non - variable star with @xmath104 and a star with mean magnitude @xmath105 varying by @xmath106 mag .",
    "we note that similar considerations would apply also if psr6266b were a triple system .    in conclusion , while option _ ( iii ) _ seems to be a quite unlike _ ad hoc _ scenario , options _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ will be finally addressed as soon as spectroscopic data are available for the system .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the nature ( thermal or not thermal ) of the optical emission and the association of the source to the cluster ( via the determination of the radial velocity ) , hence shedding some light on the nature of this puzzling object .",
