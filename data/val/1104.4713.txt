    "the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion has been strongly confirmed by numerous and complementary observational data @xcite . in the context of standard cosmology such an expansion",
    "requires the existence of an unknown dominant energy component , usually dubbed `` dark energy '' whose equation of state parameter satisfies @xmath13 . although we can affirm that the ultimate fate of the universe is determined by the feature of dark energy , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin is still rather uncertain .",
    "( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "disclosing the nature of dark energy has been one of the most important challenges of the modern cosmology and theoretical physics in the past decade .",
    "a great varieties of dark energy models have been proposed , to explain the acceleration of the universe expansion within the framework of quantum gravity , by introducing new degree of freedom or by modifying the underlying theory of gravity @xcite .    recently a very interesting suggestion on the origin of a dark energy",
    "is made , without introducing new degrees of freedom beyond what are already known , with the dark energy of just the right magnitude to give the observed expansion @xcite . in this proposal",
    ", it is claimed that the cosmological constant arises from the contribution of the ghost fields which are supposed to be present in the low - energy effective theory of qcd @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the veneziano ghost , which is unphysical in the usual minkowski spacetime qft , exhibits important physical effects in dynamical spacetime or spacetime with non - trivial topology .",
    "the ghosts are required to exist for the resolution of the @xmath14 problem , but are completely decoupled from the physical sector @xcite .",
    "the above claim is that the ghosts are decoupled from the physical states and make no contribution in the flat minkowski space , but once they are in the curved space or time - dependent background , the cancelation of their contribution to the vacuum energy is off - set , leaving a small energy density @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the hubble parameter and @xmath17 is the qcd mass scale of order a @xmath18 . with @xmath19 ,",
    "this gives the right magnitude @xmath20 for the observed dark energy density .",
    "this numerical coincidence is remarkable and also means that this model gets rid of fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this new model compared to other dark energy models is that it is totally embedded in standard model and general relativity , one needs not to introduce any new parameter , new degree of freedom or to modify gravity .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the ghost dark energy ( gde ) model in flat universe have been studied @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to extend the previous discussion on ghost dark energy @xcite to a universe with spatial curvature .",
    "there are enough observational evidences , at present time , for taking into account a small but non - negligible spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "for instance , the tendency of preferring a closed universe appeared in a suite of cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "the improved precision from wmap provides further confidence , showing that a closed universe with positively curved space is marginally preferred @xcite .",
    "in addition to cmb , recently the spatial geometry of the universe was probed by supernova measurements of the cubic correction to the luminosity distance @xcite , where a closed universe is also marginally favored .",
    "most discussions on dark energy models rely on the fact that its evolution is independent of other matter fields . given the unknown nature of both dark matter and dark energy",
    "there is nothing in principle against their mutual interaction and it seems very special that these two major components in the universe are entirely independent .",
    "indeed , this possibility has got a lot of attention in the literature in recent years ( see @xcite and references therein ) and was shown to be compatible with snia and cmb data @xcite .",
    "all above reasons , motivate us to study the interacting ghost dark energy model in a nonflat universe . in this paper",
    ", we would like to generalize the ghost dark energy model to the universe with spacial curvature in the presence of interaction between the dark matter and dark energy .",
    "taking the interaction between the two different constituents of the universe into account , we study the evolution of the universe , from early deceleration to late time acceleration .",
    "in addition , we will show that such an interacting dark energy model can accommodate a transition of the dark energy from a normal state where @xmath21 to @xmath22 phantom regimes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the ghost dark energy model in a flat universe . in section [ nonflat ]",
    ", we generalize the study to the universe with spacial curvature in the presence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy .",
    "observational constraints on the free parameters of model will be given in section iv .",
    "we summarize our results in section v.",
    "let us first review the ghost dark energy model in flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe where first investigated in @xcite .",
    "although , our approach in dealing with the problem differs to some extent from those of ref .",
    "@xcite .      for the flat frw universe filled with dark energy and dust ( dark matter ) , the corresponding friedmann equation takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the energy densities of pressureless matter and dark energy .",

    ", @xmath30 gives the right order of magnitude @xmath31 for the observed dark energy density @xcite .",
    "we define the dimensionless density parameters as @xmath32 where the critical energy density is @xmath33 .",

    "we reach @xmath38 substituting ghost energy density ( [ gde ] ) in friedmann equation ( [ fried ] ) we find @xmath39 combining eq .",
    "( [ fried2 ] ) with ( [ wd ] ) we reach @xmath40 using the fact that @xmath41 we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ wd2 ] ) as @xmath42 it is easy to see that at the early time where @xmath43 we have @xmath44 , while at the late time where @xmath45 the ghost dark energy mimics a cosmological constant , namely @xmath46 .",
    "it is worthy to note that in @xmath47 of this model , there is no free parameter . in the left panel of figure ( [ fig1 ] )",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath47 versus scale factor @xmath48 . from this figure",
    "we see that @xmath47 of the ghost dark energy model can not cross the phantom divide and the universe has a de sitter phase at late time .     for ghost dark energy .",

    "this implies that at the early time the universe is in a deceleration phase while at the late time it enters an acceleration phase .",
    "we have plotted the behavior of @xmath58 in the right panel of figure ( [ fig1 ] ) . from this figure",
    "we see that the transition from deceleration to acceleration take places at @xmath59 or equivalently at redshift @xmath60 .",

    "this figure shows that at the late time the dark energy dominates , as expected .     for ghost dark energy .",
    "here we have taken @xmath68.,width=302 ]      next we extend the discussion to the interacting case and study the dynamics of the ghost dark energy .",
    "although at this point the interaction may look purely phenomenological but different lagrangians have been proposed in support of it ( see @xcite and references therein ) . besides , in the absence of a symmetry that forbids the interaction there is nothing , in principle , against it .",
    "in addition , given the unknown nature of both dark energy and dark matter , which are two major contents of the universe , one might argue that an entirely independent behavior of dark energy is very special @xcite .",
    "further , the interacting dark mater - dark energy ( the latter in the form of a quintessence scalar field and the former as fermions whose mass depends on the scalar field ) has been investigated at one quantum loop with the result that the coupling leaves the dark energy potential stable if the former is of exponential type but it renders it unstable otherwise @xcite .",
    "thus , microphysics seems to allow enough room for the coupling ; however , this point is not fully settled and should be further investigated .",
    "the difficulty lies , among other things , in that the very nature of both dark energy and dark matter remains unknown whence the detailed form of the coupling can not be elucidated at this stage . in this case , the energy densities of dark energy and dark matter no longer satisfy independent conservation laws .",

    "it is worth noting that the continuity equations imply that the interaction term should be a function of a quantity with units of inverse of time ( a first and natural choice can be the hubble factor @xmath16 ) multiplied with the energy density .",
    "therefore , the interaction term could be in any of the following forms : ( i ) @xmath73 , ( ii ) @xmath74 , or ( iii ) @xmath75 .",
    "thus we can present the above three choices in one expression as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 it should be noted that the ideal interaction term must be motivated from the theory of quantum gravity . in the absence of such a theory , we rely on pure dimensional basis for choosing an interaction @xmath71 . in the present work for the sake of generality , we choose the third expression for the interaction term .    inserting eqs .",
