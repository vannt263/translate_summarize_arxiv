    "quantum antiferromagnetism for unfrustrated systems has been one of the most extensively researched subjects in condensed matter physics .",
    "one of the simplest models in this family , the nearest neighbor spin @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice , has been studied extensively : analytically with spin wave  @xcite and schwinger boson approaches  @xcite and numerically with quantum monte carlo  @xcite  ( which has no `` sign problem '' for bipartite lattices ) .",
    "that said , effects from physical imperfections such as the presence of open edges  @xcite and static non magnetic impurities  @xcite are less well understood and hence are areas of active research .    in this paper , we study quantum antiferromagnetism on the cayley tree  ( or bethe lattice  @xcite ) a bipartite lattice without loops , with the motivation of understanding the low energy spectrum of the spin half heisenberg model on this lattice .",
    "the cayley tree has the well - known general pathology that , in the thermodynamic limit , the number of boundary sites is a finite fraction of the total number of sites ; as a consequence , different ways of approaching the thermodynamic limit may give different results in any problem based on the cayley tree .",
    "a particular manifestation of this for the antiferromagnet is that finite trees may have a large excess of sites belonging to one sublattice over the other .",
    "our systematic study of the low energy spectrum of the spin half heisenberg hamiltonian on the cayley tree shows that the effect of sublattice imbalance is to create a `` tower of states '' , lower than the anderson tower of states  @xcite .",
    "a similar result was obtained by wang and sandvik  @xcite from their study of spin half antiferromagnets on diluted square lattices . aided by numerical calculations ,",
    "we propose a framework for understanding this effect .",
    "we also find that schwinger boson mean field theory  @xcite is a good description of the many body ground state and can reproduce many of its features quantitatively .",
    "previous studies of this model by otsuka  @xcite and friedman  @xcite focused primarily on ground state properties and excited states were not considered in these studies .",
    "more recently kumar et al .",
    "@xcite have significantly extended this analysis to both the spin-1/2 and spin-1 heisenberg model .",
    "we use all these studies as useful benchmarks for our own numerical calculations .    from a theorist s perspective",
    ", the cayley tree achieves many simplifications which makes exact solutions possible , e.g. the bose hubbard model on this lattice was recently solved by semerijan , tarzia and zamponi  @xcite .",
    "it is also the basis of approximations such as the brinkman - rice treatment of the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it found applications in the treatment of the quantum impurity problem which is at the heart of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . it does not appear that a spin model has been realized on such a topology experimentally ( though there has been interest in the study of dendrimers  @xcite ) .    in our case , the complete absence of loops makes this lattice conducive for the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm  @xcite . with the dmrg method we have an explicit ( yet compact ) representation of ground and excited state many - body wavefunctions which gives us abundant information to understand the low energy properties of these systems .",
    "in particular , reduced density matrices can be used as tools to understand properties of these states  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is divided as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model and lattices being investigated and define a measure of sublattice imbalance associated with them . in section  [ sec : dmrg ] , we give a brief overview of our implementation of the dmrg algorithm applied to generic trees . in section  [ sec : gs ] , we discuss the general properties of the ground state and excited states of the bond - centered cayley tree . in section  [ sec : sma ] , we use a variational ansatz given by the single mode approximation , in conjunction with an argument from first order perturbation theory , to explain the finite size scaling of the spin gap . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : sbmft ] , we corroborate our observations of the ground state properties , by the use of the schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) .",
    "we consider the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 heisenberg model with uniform coupling @xmath2 , @xmath3 in this paper , we use the spin rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg_hamiltonian ] ) , to label many body states by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 refers to the spin of the state and @xmath6 is its @xmath7 component .    on a bipartite lattice ( with sublattices _ a _ and _ b _ ) , like the cayley tree , with @xmath8 sites in sublattice _ a _ and @xmath9 sites in sublattice _",
    ", it is rigorously known  @xcite that the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian has a net spin @xmath10 .",
    "the first kind of tree we consider is the `` bond - centered '' cayley tree of the form depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : bond_site_center](a ) .",
    "the number of sites @xmath11 for such a cluster is related to the `` generation '' @xmath12 by , @xmath13 since the bond centered clusters have no `` global imbalance '' i.e. @xmath14 , the ground state is a singlet ( and the monotonicity of the energy with total spin @xmath5 implies that the first excited state is a triplet ) .        as mentioned before",
    ", the notion of `` local sublattice imbalance '' will be crucial in understanding the low energy physics . for the bond centered cluster , we define a measure of imbalance ( which we refer to as @xmath15 from here on ) by dividing the cluster at the central bond into two equal parts .",
    "we count the excess of one sublattice over the other in one half of the cluster and multiply by 1/2 for spin 1/2 .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath16 is related to the generation @xmath12 as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is for @xmath12 odd(even ) .",
    "[ fig : bond_site_center](b ) is the more usual way of defining a cayley tree and which we refer to as `` site - centered '' . the number of sites is related to the generation @xmath12 by , @xmath19 unlike the bond centered cluster , a global sublattice imbalance exists here which leads to a ground state spin of @xmath20 .",
    "we measure the imbalance @xmath21 in either of the three symmetrical arms of the site centered cayley tree : specifically , we count the excess sites of one sublattice over the other ( in one arm ) and multiply by 1/2 .",
    "this definition is particularly convenient as it gives us @xmath22 for all @xmath12 . a recent publication on the study of the heisenberg model on the cayley tree by kumar , ramasesha and soos  @xcite considers the site - centered clusters .",
    "we confirm their results for the site - centered case , but interestingly find that the bond - centered cluster has significantly different ground and excited state properties .",
    "we will provide some brief comparisons in section  [ sec : gs ] to illustrate this point .",
    "how is the situation different if there is no imbalance locally ? to address this , we introduce the `` fibonacci cayley tree '' . the recipe for constructing the generation @xmath23",
    "fibonacci - cayley tree is to combine the generation @xmath12 and @xmath24 trees by connecting their roots ( head sites ) to a common site ( which in turn serves as the root ( head site ) of the generation @xmath23 tree ) .",
    "[ fig : bond_site_center](c ) illustrates this construction .",
    "the total number of sites @xmath11 at generation @xmath23 is , @xmath28 observe that @xmath29 satisfies the fibonacci recursion , that is , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the @xmath12-th fibonacci number , which justifies the name of the tree .",
    "the size of this lattice grows as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the golden ratio @xmath34 . also , every 3rd generation is unbalanced by 1 and every other generation is both globally and locally balanced .",
    "table  [ table : fibonacci ] shows the sizes of the fibonacci - cayley clusters along with the number of sites in the even and odd sublattices for up to @xmath35 generations .",
    ".number of sites in a fibonacci - cayley tree as a function of generation @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath36 is number of @xmath37 sublattice sites ; @xmath38 except for the entries marked with @xmath39 , in which case @xmath40 .",
