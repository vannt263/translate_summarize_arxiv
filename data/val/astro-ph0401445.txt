    "all reach the earth together .",
    "they provide a record of the history of the universe throughout its evolution , but it is a confused record .",
    "two photons that simultaneously pierce the same pixel of a detector may have been emitted billions of years apart by regions of the universe that were in vastly different stages of evolution .",
    "one of the challenges in observational cosmology is to separate the layers of history that we on earth receive superposed .",
    "this paper is concerned with a small part of the challenge : locating galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 among the countless objects that speckle the night sky .",
    "the redshift range is interesting for a number of reasons . during the @xmath13 billion years that elapsed between redshifts  3 and  1 , the comoving density of star formation was near its peak",
    ", the hubble sequence of galaxies may have been established , and a large fraction of the stars in the universe were born ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 , rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) . observing star - formation at these redshifts will likely play an important role in our attempts to understand galaxy formation .",
    "identifying galaxies at @xmath2 would be easy if observing time were infinite .",
    "one could simply obtain a spectrum of every object in a deep image and discard those at lower or higher redshift . in practice telescope time",
    "is limited and one would like to spend as much of it as possible studying objects of interest  not finding them . our aim is to present simple strategies that allow observers to locate star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 with only a minimal loss of telescope time to deep imaging or spectroscopy of objects at the wrong redshifts .",
    "we shall assume throughout that the goal is to identify star - forming galaxies that lie inside a narrow range of redshifts within the wider span @xmath2 .",
    "concentrating on a narrow range has obvious observational advantages ; galaxies at similar redshifts have similar spectral features that lie at similar observed wavelengths , and consequently the spectrograph can be chosen and configured in a way that is optimized for every object on a multislit mask .",
    "it is also necessary for many scientific programs .",
    "one might want to discover where galaxies lie relative to the intergalactic gas that produces absorption lines in the spectra of a qso at @xmath14 , for example , or to create a large and homogeneous sample of galaxies at a single epoch in the past that can then be compared to existing samples of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "projects with wildly different goals may benefit less from the strategies we advocate .",
    "standard magnitude - limited spectroscopy or photometric redshifts might be preferable if ( for example ) one wanted to create a sample that contained all galaxy types at all redshifts .",
    "our approach exploits the fact that the wavelength - dependent cross - sections of various common atoms and ions give distinctive colors to galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "it has been recognized for decades that measuring a galaxy s brightness through a range of broad - band filters should therefore provide some indication of its redshift ( e.g. , baum 1962 ; koo 1985 ; loh & spillar 1986 ) .",
    "recent work suggests that a redshift accuracy of @xmath15 can be achieved for galaxies at @xmath16 given extravagantly precise photometry through 7 filters that span the wavelength range @xmath17 m ( e.g. , hogg et al .",
    "1998 ; budavri et al .",
    "2000 ; fernndez - soto et al . 2001",
    "; rowan - robinson 2003 ) .",
    "an accuracy @xmath15 is clearly sufficient for finding galaxies at @xmath2 , but obtaining the necessary deep images through numerous filters consumes enormous amounts of telescope time that could be more profitably devoted to galaxy spectroscopy .",
    "we were led to seek specialized color - selection techniques that could identify galaxies at @xmath2 even in comparatively noisy images taken through a small number of optical filters .",
    "such techniques can succeed only if they take advantage of strong and obvious features in galaxies spectra .",
    "no feature is stronger than the lyman break at 912  produced by the photo - electric opacity of hydrogen in its ground state .",
    "meier ( 1976 ) argued that the strength of this break would allow high - redshift galaxies to be identified in images taken through just three filters , a claim that steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1999 ) have since confirmed .",
    "although the lyman break itself is not visible from the ground at @xmath18 , other weaker features are , and the success of two - color selection at @xmath19 inspired us try to develop similar two - color optical selection strategies for @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : filters ] shows some of the spectral features that we had to work with .",
    "most obvious , after the lyman - break , is the balmer - break at 3700 .",
    "the strength of the balmer - break can be estimated from the model galaxy spectra described in   [ sec : bcseds ] or from the galaxy observations described in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "  [ sec : bbg ] explains how it can be used to find galaxies at @xmath20 .",
    "franx et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and davis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have also used this feature to find distant galaxies . at @xmath21",
    "no strong breaks are present in the optical spectra of galaxies , but the lack of spectral breaks is itself a distinguishing characteristic of galaxies at these redshifts .    [ sec : bx ] ,  [ sec : bmz ] , and  [ sec : anyz ] explain .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "together with the lyman - break technique , the selection techniques presented here allow the efficient creation of large samples of star - forming galaxies throughout the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "our development of selection strategies began with theoretical models of galaxy spectra . at redshifts",
    "@xmath18 a galaxy s optical broad - band colors are determined by the mixture of stellar types it contains .",
    "this is in turn largely determined by a galaxy s star - formation history .",
    "galaxies that formed most of their stars recently have spectra dominated by bright and hot massive stars , while galaxies that formed most of their stars in the distant past will have spectra dominated by fainter , cooler , but longer - lived low - mass stars .",
    "we considered five model galaxy spectra that were intended to span the range of possible star - formation histories .",
    "each model spectrum was calculated with the code of bruzual & charlot ( 1996 , private communication ) and assumed that the galaxy s star - formation rate as a function of time , @xmath23 , was a decaying exponential : @xmath24 .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath25 and assumed time - lapse since the onset of star formation for our five models are listed in table  [ tab : bcseds ] .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) show that star - formation histories with these parameters reproduce the observed spectra of different galaxy types in the local universe . because a wide range of star - formation histories can result in nearly identical model spectra , we were not concerned that some of our adopted model parameters are physically impossible at high redshift due to the young age of the universe .",
    "parameter combinations that are more plausible can produce similar spectra , and in any case our aim was only to have model spectra that roughly spanned the range of conceivability .",
    "subsequent empirical refinements of our selection criteria would compensate for any shortcomings in our model spectra .",

    "for the reddening @xmath28 that appears typical for high - redshift galaxies ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ) the resulting change in galaxy color is not large : 0.22 magnitudes from rest - frame 1500  to 2000 , 0.16 from 2000  to 2500 , 0.13 from 2500  to 3000 , 0.21 from 3000  to 4000 .",
    "the formulae that we used to calculate template galaxies colors can be found ( e.g. ) in   4.2 of papovich ,",
    "dickinson , & ferguson 2001 .",
    "although our initial ideas for color - selection strategies were motivated by model galaxy spectra (   [ sec : bcseds ] ) , our final selection criteria were determined by the observed broadband colors of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "the galaxies we used lay within fields observed during our survey of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath29 ( steidel et al .",
    "2003 ) or within fields chosen with similar criteria .",
    "@xmath7 images of each field were obtained as described in steidel et al .",

    "a complete description of our @xmath32 observations can be found in steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "galaxies were selected for spectroscopic follow - up on the basis of their colors .",
    "initially our spectroscopy was exploratory , as we sought to establish whether a certain combination of colors reliably indicated that a galaxy lay within a targeted redshift range . during this",
    "phase galaxies were observed on multislit masks that were primarily devoted to the lyman - break survey .",
    "the spectroscopic set - up for these observations ( @xmath39 slits , @xmath40  resolution , @xmath41  wavelength coverage , @xmath42 hour integration time with lris on the keck i or ii telescopes ) is described in steidel et al .",
    "later , after our initial color - selection criteria had been validated or refined , entire masks were filled with objects that satisfied them , and the spectroscopic set - up was optimized to the targeted redshift . for redshifts @xmath43 , where our redshift measurements were based primarily on absorption lines in the rest - frame far - uv , the difference from the lyman - break survey set - up was slight .",
    "most of these spectra were obtained with the blue arm of lris using a 400 line mm@xmath44 grism blazed at 3400  and @xmath45 slits . the resulting spectra had @xmath46  resolution and stretched from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . for roughly half of the spectra we concurrently obtained spectra with the red arm , usually with a 6800  dichroic and 400 line mm@xmath44 @xmath49  grating that provided spectra of @xmath46resolution from 6800  to 9500 . at @xmath50",
    "our redshift measurements were based primarily on the [ oii]@xmath51 doublet .",
    "here we benefited from redder , higher - resolution gratings and could tolerate shorter exposure times .",
    "@xmath52 slits , @xmath53  resolution , wavelength coverage from @xmath54  to @xmath55 , and 1 hour integration times were typical .",
    "all data were reduced with procedures similar to those described in steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "because our goal was to measure the maximum number of galaxy redshifts , we would begin observing a new slitmask after the previous slitmask s allotted integration time had elapsed , even if ( as was usually the case ) our exposures had not been long enough to produce spectra that allowed us to measure a redshift for every object . in the best conditions we were able to measure redshifts for @xmath56% of the objects . in the worst conditions few of our spectra",
    "were usable .",
    "averaging over all conditions , our net spectroscopic success rate was roughly @xmath57% .",

    "nevertheless readers should be aware that our sample suffers from some incompleteness .",
    "figure  [ fig : specsuccess ] shows our spectroscopic failure rate as a function of @xmath7 color for objects whose spectra were obtained with the blue spectroscopic configuration described above and in steidel et al . ( 2003 ) .",
    "there is little evidence that the failure rate depends strongly on objects intrinsic colors within the color selection windows described below .",
    "most galaxies have a break in their spectra at @xmath60that is produced by a combination of hydrogen balmer - continuum absorption in the spectra of b , a , and f stars and caii h&k absorption in the spectra of f , g , and k stars .",
    "the relative strengths of the balmer and 4000  breaks depends upon the mixture of stellar types in a galaxy  younger galaxies have stronger balmer breaks and older galaxies have stronger 4000  breaks  but few galaxies have no break at all ( figure  [ fig : bbgmethod ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : filters ] suggests that this break should give distinctive broadband colors to galaxies at @xmath50 . at no other redshift",
    "will a strong break between @xmath61 and @xmath30 be accompanied by a flatter spectrum at bluer wavelengths .",
    "our first guess at photometric selection criteria targeting galaxies at @xmath50 was inspired by figure  [ fig : expcolz1 ] , which shows the @xmath3 colors of model galaxies at various redshifts (  [ sec : bcseds ] ) and of stars in our own galaxy .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of objects with colors that are characteristic of @xmath50 galaxies and distinct from the colors of other objects should produce a redshift survey consisting primarily of galaxies at @xmath50 .",

    "these criteria are called `` fn '' in our internal naming convention and may be referred to by that name in subsequent publications .",
    "even if galaxies at @xmath50 had colors that matched the models perfectly , and even if we suffered no photometric errors , figure  [ fig : expcolz1 ] makes it clear that some galaxies at @xmath50 would not satisfy the selection criteria above .",

    "are galaxies at the opposite extreme , galaxies with present star - formation rates much higher than their past average .",
    "the spectra of these galaxies are dominated by light from massive o stars  by stars whose atmospheres are too hot to contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen  and consequently they do not have balmer breaks . since a balmer break begins to be discernible when a star - formation episode has lasted longer than the typical @xmath63 yr lifetime of an o star , and since most star formation in the local universe ( e.g. , heckman 1997 ) and at @xmath29 ( e.g. , papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al . 2001 ) occurs in episodes that last substantially longer than @xmath64 yr , we suspected that our reliance on the balmer - break in our selection criteria would not cause us to miss significant numbers of star - forming galaxies at @xmath50 .    in order to obtain empirical support for our proposed selection criteria ( equation  [ eq : fn ] )",

    "these galaxies have rest - frame colors nearly identical to those of local ellipticals ( see figure  [ fig : expcolz1 ] ) .",
    "they are objects that formed the bulk of their stars in the past and are no longer forming stars at a significant rate .",
    "their absence from a color - selected survey of star - forming galaxies is expected and harmless .",
    "second , there are objects with colors identical to those of low redshift galaxies but with reported spectroscopic redshifts @xmath59 .",
    "some of these objects may have unusual star - formation histories or large photometric errors or exceptionally strong emission lines , and some may have incorrectly measured spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "third , there are objects with measured colors that lie just outside the balmer - break color selection window .",
    "these galaxies may have been scattered out of our selection window by photometric errors , which are typically @xmath68 magnitudes in both @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "their absence from a balmer - break selected survey can be largely corrected with statistical techniques described in adelberger ( 2002,2004 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : z1triptych ] presents the data of figure  [ fig : showcandsz1 ] in a way that may be easier to grasp .",
    "we produced one alternate realization of figure  [ fig : showcandsz1 ] s data by adding to each galaxy s @xmath3 colors a gaussian deviate with standard deviation @xmath71 that is similar to the color s measurement uncertainty .",
    "after repeating this procedure numerous times , we concatenated the alternate realizations into a large list of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath31 triplets , and then calculated , for each point in the @xmath3 plane , the fraction of galaxies with those colors in the large list that had redshift @xmath4 .",

    "one exception is the region near @xmath72 , @xmath73 , which is populated primarily by galaxies at @xmath50 but lies outside our selection window",
    ". it would be easy to modify the window to include this region , but , as mentioned above , galaxies at @xmath50 with these colors do not account for much of the star - formation density .",
    "we chose to ignore them .",
    "readers interested in stellar mass rather than star - formation rate might choose differently .",
    "ideal color - selection criteria would be perfectly complete and perfectly efficient ; they would be satisfied by every galaxy in the targeted redshift interval and only by galaxies in the targeted redshift interval .",
    "figure  [ fig : z1triptych ] shows that in practice the goals of completeness and efficiency are incompatible .",

    "if we wanted our color - selected survey to be as complete as possible , we would want to make our selection box very large so that it would include even galaxies with large photometric errors or abnormal spectral shapes , but this improvement in completeness would come at the price of admitting more galaxies at the wrong redshifts and it would therefore decrease our efficiency . to quantify",

    "it is often asserted that studying galaxies at redshifts @xmath2 will be tremendously difficult .",
    "the optical spectra of galaxies near the middle of this redshift range contain neither the strong spectral breaks that are sometimes thought to be necessary for effective photometric selection nor the strong emission lines ly-@xmath74 or [ oii]@xmath51 that are sometimes thought to be crucial for spectroscopic identification .",
    "the supposed difficulty of galaxy observations causes many to refer to this redshift range as the spectroscopic desert or high place of sacrifice ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we are sceptical .",
    "the optical colors of galaxies at redshifts @xmath2 _ are _ distinctive .",
    "we showed in sections  [ sec : bbg ] ,  [ sec : bx ] , and  [ sec : bmz ] that these galaxies are easy to locate in deep images using simple color - selection criteria ( equation  [ eq : fn ] for @xmath129 , equation  [ eq : fnz15 ] for @xmath82 , equation  [ eq : bx ] for @xmath9 , and equation  [ eq : bm ] for @xmath8 ) .",
    "once they have been found their redshifts are no harder to measure than those of comparably bright galaxies at slightly higher or lower redshift .",
    "this is due in large part to the strength of their interstellar absorption lines . with an appropriately chosen spectroscopic set - up , redshifts are as easy to measure from absorption lines as from the lyman-@xmath74 or [ oii]@xmath1303727 emission lines .",
    "the point is illustrated by figure  [ fig : zperhour ] ; during our surveys we obtained as many redshifts per hour of observing time at @xmath43 as at the higher redshifts where lyman-@xmath74 is more easily observed .",
    "that was possible only because we knew the approximate redshifts of our sources in advance and could optimize our choice of spectrograph and its configuration accordingly .",
    "we could not have measured a redshift for many of the galaxies at @xmath43 with a spectrograph that lacked the good uv throughput of lris - b .",
    "see steidel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a more detailed discussion .",
    "two to three nights spent imaging a single field with a uv - sensitive @xmath131 camera on a 4 m telescope is sufficient to detect @xmath132 galaxies that satisfy one set of the @xmath2 color - selection criteria that we have presented .",
    "a major benefit of color - selected spectroscopy is that it lets one draw statistically significant conclusions from this large number of high - redshift galaxies without having to measure a redshift for every one .",
    "for example , the @xmath133 spectroscopic redshifts we have measured for objects whose colors satisfy equation  [ eq : fn ] tell us , with high precision , what the redshift distribution must be for the large ensemble of objects in the @xmath131 image whose colors satisfy equation  [ eq : fn ] .",
    "one can use this knowledge to derive the luminosity function or spatial clustering strength of galaxies at @xmath50 from the list of photometric candidates alone . because the redshift distribution of photometric candidates does not depend strongly on magnitude for faint galaxies ( figure  [ fig : meanz_vs_r ] )",
    ", it should be possible to use purely photometric observations to learn about the properties of the numerous high - redshift galaxies that are too faint for spectroscopy .",
    "this may be best use of our @xmath50 color - selection criteria , since the brightest galaxies at this redshift are routinely detected in the large and ongoing spectroscopic surveys of davis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and le fevre et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the weakness of color - selected surveys is that not all galaxies at the targeted redshifts will satisfy the adopted selection criteria .",
    "a high level of completeness at the targeted redshifts can be obtained only at the price of admitting large numbers of galaxies at the wrong redshifts . with the simple selection criteria we presented",
    ", observers will find more than @xmath134 one - half of the galaxies brighter than the magnitude limit at the redshift of interest and will waste no more than @xmath134 one - half of their observing time observing objects at other redshifts .",
    "50% completeness is not ideal , but the problem is less severe than one might imagine .",
    "first , a star - forming galaxy at @xmath2 that does not satisfy one of our color - selection criteria will likely satisfy another .",
    "consider galaxies with redshift @xmath135 and magnitude @xmath124 , for example .",
    "equation  [ eq : z2alpha ] implies that only 63% of them will satisfy the @xmath9 selection criteria of equation  [ eq : bx ] .",
    "but an additional 26% will satisfy the @xmath136 selection criteria of equation  [ eq : bm ] , and an additional 5% will satisfy the lyman - break galaxy selection criteria of steidel et al .",
    "a total of 94% of photometrically detected galaxies with @xmath111 and @xmath135 will satisfy one of the @xmath7 selection criteria we have presented . by conducting redshift surveys with each of these criteria",
    ", one can reduce the incompleteness to a reasonably low level .",
    "second , even if a survey adopts only one of our selection criteria , much of the incompleteness can be corrected in a statistical sense .",
    "the incompleteness is largely due to the photometric errors in our color measurements , which are not small compared to the size of our color - selection window .",
    "many galaxies whose true colors lie inside our selection window will have measured colors that lie outside the window ; many galaxies whose measured colors lie inside will have true colors that lie outside .",
    "the result is a broad , bell - shaped redshift histogram rather than a boxcar extending from the minimum to the maximum targeted redshift .",
    "because photometric uncertainties are easy to characterize with monte - carlo simulations , their contribution to our incompleteness is easy to understand and correct .",
    "adelberger ( 2002,2004 ) explains in detail .    in any case , all observational strategies require some compromise between efficiency and completeness , and the compromises of color selection do not look bad compared to the alternatives .",
    "suppose one were interested in studying galaxies at @xmath4 . by obtaining a spectrum of every galaxy brighter than @xmath137 in an image one would be certain to produce a statistically complete sample of galaxies at @xmath50 to this magnitude limit , but over 80% of the observing time would have been spent on objects at the wrong redshifts ( e.g. , cohen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if one were willing to tolerate 15% incompleteness in observed @xmath76 luminosity density , one could cull spectroscopic targets with the color criteria of equation  [ eq : fn ] and reduce the required observing time by more than a factor of three ( see table  [ tab : fncompint ] ) .",
    "as redshift increases the benefits of color - selection become more obvious .",
    "only one object out of 50 in the magnitude limited survey of cohen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) had a redshift @xmath9 .",
    "if one wished to study galaxies at these redshifts with a magnitude limited survey the required observing time would be 33 times longer than if one color - selected targets with equation  [ eq : bx ] ( see table  [ tab : z2compint ] ) .",
    "a project that could be completed in 12 years with color - selection would require a lifetime of observing with standard magnitude - limited techniques .",
    "the @xmath138% incompleteness of color - selected surveys does not seem a high price to pay .",
    "than cohen s 1 in 50 , so the comparison is somewhat unfair . in practice , however , few would chose to undertake a magnitude - limited survey with a blue spectrograph because it would make spectra more difficult to identify at the lower redshifts where most sources lie .",
    "the ability to take full advantage of optimized spectrographs is a non - negligible benefit of color selection . ]",
    "magnitude - limited optical surveys are not the only alternative to color - selected optical surveys .",
    "many have advocated finding galaxies at @xmath2 with photometry outside of the optical window .",
    "we chose to develop criteria that relied solely on optical photometry because ground - based optical imagers offer an unrivaled combination of high sensitivity , high spatial resolution , and large fields - of - view .",
    "this is an advantage that is difficult to overcome .",
    "surveys at other wavelengths have their strengths  near - ir observations should provide a more complete census of older stars ( e.g. , franx et al .",
    "2003 , rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) and far - ir / sub - mm observations should yield more reliable estimates of star - formation rates  but the fact remains that an investigator given two nights on an older 4 m optical telescope can create a photometric sample of high - redshift galaxies larger than all existing samples at other wavelengths combined .",
    "it seems likely to us that much of what we will learn about galaxies at @xmath139 in the coming decade will come from large optical surveys selected with color criteria similar to ours .",
    "attentive readers may have recognized that the derivation of these criteria did not require much thought .",
    "that is exactly the point .",
    "the value of this paper , if any , lies not in our photometric selection criteria themselves but in the proof that large samples of galaxies at @xmath2 can be created with trivial techniques that rely solely on ground - based imaging and well - developed ccd technology .",
