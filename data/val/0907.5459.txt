    "acceleration of charged particles is an internal property of energy release in solar flares , which has not yet been fully understood in spite of a significant progress achieved recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a traditional way of getting information on the accelerated electrons in flares is the analysis of the hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission produced by nonthermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , because the bremsstrahlung intensity increases with the density of the ambient plasma , it is likely that in most cases the acceleration site and hxr emission site are spatially separated ; therefore , the hxr emission does not carry direct information on the acceleration site .",
    "this concept of distinct acceleration , propagation , and emission regions was then inherited by solar radio astronomy ( e.g. , fig . 9 in",
    "* ) , which looks relevant to relatively weak events of electron acceleration visualized by coherent emission of type iii groups and of accompanying metric spikes ( e.g. , fig .",
    "10 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , it is well known that a charged particle produces electromagnetic emission as it moves with acceleration .",
    "stated another way , fast electrons must produce radiation immediately at the acceleration region with intensity and other characteristics defined by type of the acceleration , or more precisely , by the type of fast electron trajectories in the acceleration region .",
    "we show in this letter that typically this emission has a spectral peak at the microwave range , which makes the radio observation the most suitable to study the acceleration region in flares .    by now , a huge variety of acceleration mechanisms and models has been proposed and developed for the solar flares .",
    "acceleration by dc electric fields , both sub - dreicer and super - dreicer , @xcite ; stochastic acceleration by turbulent waves @xcite , the classical diffusive shock acceleration @xcite ; the regular ( betatron plus fermi ) acceleration in collapsing magnetic traps @xcite ; all are currently considered in the context of solar flares .    to illustrate potential ability of radio observations to detect the radiation from the flare acceleration site and to distinguish then between competing acceleration mechanisms",
    ", we calculate here radio emission generated within two distinct acceleration models ",
    "stochastic acceleration by a turbulence spectrum and regular acceleration in collapsing traps .",
    "radio emission of flares is known to be produced by a variety of emission mechanisms including gyrosynchrotron ( gs ) emission , bremsstrahlung , transition radiation , and a number of coherent radiative processes @xcite .",
    "some of the observed emission types can in fact originate from acceleration sites , while others  from electrons trapped in closed magnetic loops or from electrons propagating along open field lines .",
    "based on our analysis , we suggest that some of the narrowband microwave and decimeter continuum bursts may be a signature of the stochastic acceleration in solar flares , while the collapsing trap acceleration must reveal itself in drifting to higher frequencies microwave gs bursts .",
    "basically , various models of stochastic acceleration differ from each other by the accelerating agent ( the plasma or mhd eigen - mode responsible for the wave - particle energy exchange ) and presence or absence of some pre - acceleration ( injection ) process . to be specific , we assume a pure stochastic acceleration process when the electrons are accelerated directly from the thermal pool @xcite , perhaps as a result of mhd turbulence cascading towards the smallest scales involved into resonant interaction of the waves with thermal or weakly superthermal electrons",
    ".    within this model the mhd turbulence is created at some large scale and then a broad spectrum of the turbulence develops due to the turbulence cascading .",
    "as soon as small - scale waves capable of resonant interaction with electrons from maxwellian tail are produced they start to accelerate those electrons .",
    "this process can be modeled by growing a power - law tail ( sf . ,",
    "e.g. spectra of accelerated electrons presented by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath0 where the time - dependent acceleration is modeled by increasing the break energy @xmath1 and hardening the energy spectrum ( decreasing spectral index @xmath2 ) .",
    "this nonthermal distribution of accelerated electrons is assumed to match the original maxwellian distribution at a certain energy @xmath3 ; @xmath4 is evidently defined by the matching condition : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number density and temperature of the thermal electrons , @xmath8 is the boltzman constant .",
    "figure  [ fig01 ] shows a sequence of the electron spectra as the electron acceleration progresses .",
    "let us consider the radio emission produced by accelerated electrons with the spectrum ( [ el_spectrum_st_acc ] ) at the acceleration region .",
    "we note that gyrosynchrotron ( gs ) emission by nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic electrons available during an initial phase of the acceleration modeled by eq .",
    "( [ el_spectrum_st_acc ] ) is inefficient ; the flux of the gs emission remains typically very small until sufficient number of electrons is accelerated up to a few hundred kev @xcite .",
    "however , along with the regular magnetic field , there is a spectrum of turbulent waves ( those accelerating the electrons ) at the acceleration site .",
    "the nonthermal electrons , interacting with those random waves , experience spatial diffusion and so produce so called diffusive synchrotron radiation ( dsr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we calculate here .    neglecting for simplicity the plasma gyrotropy we can take the refractive index of the radio waves in the form @xmath9 then",

    "similarly to the derivation in ultrarelativistic case @xcite , the transverse component of the acceleration can be expressed via temporal and spatial fourier transform of the external lorentz force , @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of emitting particle and @xmath24 is the source volume . for electric component of the lorenz force @xmath25",
    "we have    @xmath26    where @xmath27 @xmath28 is the correlation tensor of the random electric field , such as @xmath29 @xcite .    for magnetic component of the lorenz force",

    "( [ e_corr ] ) we have    @xmath31    where @xmath28 is the correlation tensor of the random magnetic field , such as @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the dsr intensity , @xmath33 , of a nonrelativistic particle in the presence of random magnetic field is @xmath34 this expression is valid for arbitrary spectrum of magnetic turbulence including anisotropic distributions .",
    "we consider here the dsr produced by accelerated nonrelativistic electrons interacting with the mhd turbulence . in mhd waves",
    "@xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the alfvn speed , therefore the magnetic part of the lorenz force is larger than the electric part for all electrons with @xmath37 . assuming this condition to be fulfilled , we calculate only the dsr related to the magnetic field of the mhd turbulence ; inclusion of electric field effect will further increase the dsr intensity .",
    "since we are interested in overall spectral shapes and flux level of the dsr , rather than model - dependent details of the emission , we consider here the simplest case of the isotropic mhd turbulence :    @xmath38    as we assumed @xmath37 , i.e. , the electrons move faster than the waves , we can adopt the mhd turbulence to be quasi static , @xmath39 . when the mhd turbulence is isotropic , the accelerated electrons are isotropic as well , and so the radiation produced is also isotropic .",
    "thus , we consider further the radiation produced into the full solid angle    @xmath40    where , like in the ultrarelativistic case @xcite , we introduce the scattering rate of the nonrelativistic particle by mhd turbulence @xmath41 :    @xmath42    to proceed further we have to specify the shape of the turbulence spectrum @xmath43 ; we adopt a single power - law down to the smallest ( resonant to thermal electrons ) scales :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 with @xmath46 the largest turbulence scale , @xmath47 is the mean square of the turbulent magnetic field , and @xmath48 is the turbulence spectral index .",
    "then , substituting ( [ k_pow_law ] ) into ( [ q_w_iso ] ) , integrating over @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the thermal velocity of the plasma electrons , @xmath52 is the step function , and using the electron charge @xmath53 and mass @xmath54 for @xmath18 and @xmath23 , we find @xmath55 so the dsr spectrum produced by accelerated electrons reads @xmath56    now we calculate the dsr power from @xmath57 electrons with the spectrum described by eq .",
    "( [ el_spectrum_st_acc ] ) @xmath58 in fact , we are interested in the radio flux observed at the earth . to transform this radiation power into the flux observed at the earth , we change the variable @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 .",
    "then , the flux is @xmath61 where @xmath62  au@xmath63  cm is the distance from the earth to the sun .    to evaluate the dsr from the acceleration region of a solar flare , we adopt some typically assumed parameters of the acceleration site as follows : ( a ) the size of the site @xmath64 cm ; ( b ) the thermal electron number density @xmath65 @xmath66 ; ( c ) the electron temperature @xmath67 k ; ( d ) the energy density of the magnetic turbulence @xmath68 erg/@xmath69 .",
    "accordingly , the total energy , @xmath70 ergs , corresponds to a very modest solar flare .",
    "we assume that the power - law tail of the accelerated electrons grows from @xmath71 with @xmath4 specified by matching condition ( [ el_matching_st_acc ] ) and as the acceleration has started , the power law index @xmath72 changes from @xmath73 while the break energy @xmath74 increases from @xmath75 kev .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] presents the sequence of calculated dsr spectra for 11 different @xmath72 values from @xmath76 ; the spectra are calculated for three different @xmath48 values and for two different @xmath3 values .",
    "the blue curves indicate larger @xmath72 , while the red ones show smaller @xmath72 .",
    "then , figure  [ fig04](a ) presents the dsr spectra for three different temperature values , @xmath77 .",
    "in addition to spectrum shapes , light curves of the radiation at different frequencies can be informative . to estimate the light curve behavior we adopt a soft - hard - soft spectrum evolution as follows from theory of spectrum evolution for the stochastic acceleration @xcite , and which is typical for impulsive flares , with the electron energy spectral index @xmath2 changing from 8 to 3 and then back to 8 , while the break energy @xmath74 increasing all the way from 50 kev to @xmath78  mev .",
    "figure  [ fig04](b ) shows the corresponding model light curves at a few frequencies around the spectrum peak .",
    "one can note from the figure that higher frequency light curves have a somewhat shorter duration , although peaking at the same time ; so no appreciable time delay between the light curves is expected .",
    "+    we note that the dsr spectra are very narrowband , much narrower that typical gyrosynchrotron spectra .",
    "the high frequency slope of the dsr spectrum can easily be evaluated from eqns .",
    "( [ dsr_flux ] ) , ( [ dsr_ensemble ] ) , ( [ q_w_plw ] ) , and ( [ dsr_w_eps ] ) , @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the dsr high frequency spectral index varies from 11 to 3 as the spectral index of accelerated electrons changes from 7 to 3 , while the gs spectral index would vary from 5 to 1 for the same range of @xmath72 variation .",
    "the peak flux of the dsr is highly sensitive to the turbulence spectral index ( specified eventually by the mhd cascading law ) , while less sensitive to the plasma temperature and electron spectral index .",
    "the peak flux can be very large ( up to a few hundred sfu ) , which makes it easily observable even by full sun radio instruments .",
    "if so , the corresponding radio emission must have been widely observed by available radio spectrometers working in the decimetric and/or microwave range .",
    "indeed , there is a class of radio bursts with the properties resembling the dsr properties described here ",
    "it is the class of narrowband decimetric and microwave continuum bursts ( including type ivdm ) , which , we suggest , may contain burst - candidates to the radio emission from the regions of stochastic acceleration in solar flares .",
    "although this interpretation is tempting , spatially resolved radio observations of the dsr will be needed to confirm it , to locate the region of stochastic acceleration , and study it in detail .",
    "another plausible candidate for radio emission from stochastic acceleration episodes is so - called transient brightenings , whose radio spectra are often narrowband @xcite .",
    "let us consider another model , a collapsing magnetic trap , which can efficiently accelerate charged particles .",
    "unlike the stochastic acceleration models , no turbulence spectrum is essential to accelerate particles in the collapsing trap model ; however , some spectrum of pre - accelerated particles is needed , otherwise , the collapse of the trap will only give rise to plasma heating without nonthermal particle generation .",
    "therefore , we assume that just before collapsing the trap contained both thermal plasma and nonthermal electron population with a power - law spectrum .",
    "to be specific , we adopt the initial conditions as follows : ( a ) the magnetic field strength @xmath80 g ; ( b ) the minimum and the maximum energy of the power - law spectrum @xmath81 mev , @xmath82 mev ; ( c ) the thermal electron density @xmath83 @xmath66 and the non - thermal electron density @xmath84 @xmath66 ; ( d ) the source size @xmath85 .    during the trap contraction",
    ", the number of accelerated electrons evolves . for our modeling",
    "we adopt a solution obtained by @xcite , see figure  [ fig05 ] , which takes into account the betatron and fermi acceleration and the particle escape from the trap via the loss cone :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 so @xmath88 changes from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the largest magnetic field value at the end of the trap collapse , and @xmath92 deceases from @xmath93 to a very low value , say , @xmath94 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume a self - similar contraction of the collapsing magnetic trap . in this case ,",
    "evolution of all parameters of the trap is uniquely defined by their initial values and the dimensionless source scale @xmath92 .",
    "thus , for any given contraction law , @xmath92 , we can easily calculate the corresponding time history of all other relevant source parameters , as the magnetic field , the thermal electron number density , the source volume and the projected area , and the evolution of the nonthermal electron spectrum @xcite . for our modeling",
    "we adopt that the trap volume @xmath24 linearly decreases with time during the trap contraction from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ; we adopt 10  s for the trap collapse time , which is a few alfven times ( @xmath97 ) for the trap parameters used .",
    "+    thus , we can straightforwardly calculate the gs spectra at different time frames and the radio light curves at different frequencies within the adopted collapsing trap model .",
    "figure  [ fig05 ] displays the gs spectra at different moments of the trap contraction . in agreement with a statement made in the previous section , at initial phase of acceleration",
    "the gs flux is small ( less than 1 sfu ) , which can only be recorded by high sensitivity spatially resolved observations .",
    "however , during the trap contraction the magnetic field increases and the fast electrons are accelerated , which all together lead to a significant increase of the peak flux and the peak frequency of the radio emission produced at the acceleration site ; thus the radio emission becomes easily detectable by available radio instrument soon after the trap starts to contract .",
    "+    figure  [ fig07 ] presents the light curves of the emission at a number of fixed frequencies , 5 , 10 , 17 , 34 ghz . within the adopted model the peak flux increases with frequency ,",
    "see figures  [ fig05 ] ,  [ fig07 ] ; in fact , this increase may become less pronounced if the coulomb losses in the collapsing trap are taken into account @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of the light curves , contrasting to that of dsr produced from the stochastic acceleration sites , is a noticeable time delay : the higher frequency light curves are delayed relative to lower frequency light curves ; this time delay will be present even when the coulomb losses @xcite are included . a time delay in the sense predicted by our modeling",
    "is frequently observed in solar flares , in particular , in those with quasiperiodic pulsations @xcite .",
    "observationally , however , the gs emission from a collapsing trap can be contaminated by gs emission from trapped electrons produced by previous acceleration episodes , so unambiguous detection of the gs emission from a collapsing trap itself requires additional accurate analysis to separate the contributions , which as yet has not been performed .",
    "there are many models in which electrons can be accelerated to nonthermal energies .",
    "some mechanisms accelerate a tiny fraction of the electrons , which can only be observed via coherent radio emissions ( e.g. , type iii bursts produced by electron beams , or accompanying metric spikes ) , others produce more powerful acceleration , sufficient to generate observable incoherent radio emission from either the acceleration site itself of from a remote radiation site.    the idea of using radio observations to probe energy release / acceleration regions in flares has been around for awhile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , the studies focused mainly on _ coherent _ decimeter radio bursts . for example , @xcite argued that decimeter narrowband millisecond radio spike clusters can be a signature of electron acceleration in flares , and , if so , the flare energy release must have been highly fragmented with each spike indicating a single energy release / acceleration episode .",
    "however , it has been found @xcite that the radio spikes are frequently delayed compared with associated hard x - ray emission , implying the spikes are a secondary phenomenon associated with flares .",
    "moreover , spatially resolved observations @xcite show that the spike sources are typically far away from main flare locations . even though higher frequency microwave radio spikes @xcite can be produced at or around the main flare location @xcite , it seems doubtful that the coherent radio burst originate from elementary acceleration episodes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this letter we have calculated _ incoherent _ radio emission from the acceleration region of a solar flare within two distinct acceleration models ",
    "stochastic acceleration by cascading mhd turbulence and regular ( betatron and fermi ) acceleration in a collapsing trap .",
    "we have demonstrated that the radio emissions produced within these two competing acceleration models are distinctly different , which potentially allows distinguishing between them by the radio observations . in particular , we have found that the stochastic acceleration process is accompanied by a very narrowband dsr continuum radio emission , whose predicted properties are generally consistent with observed properties of narrowband microwave or decimetric ( type ivdm ) continuum bursts , thus , we suggest that some of those bursts can be produced from the sites of stochastic acceleration . this work was supported in part by nsf grants ast-0607544 , atm-0707319 , and atm-0745744 , and nasa grant nng06gj40 g , nnx0 - 7ah78 g , and nnx0 - 8aq90 g to new jersey institute of technology , and by the russian foundation for basic research , grants 08 - 02 - 92228 , 09 - 02 - 00226 , and 09 - 02 - 00624 .",
