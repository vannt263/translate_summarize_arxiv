    "the complexity of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) inhibits the computation of hadronic properties and reactions from first principles . as a consequence models that potentially imitate the essentials of the qcd dynamics",
    "have been developed in the past to describe hadrons . a relativistic description of baryons as three  quark bound states is provided by the solutions of the bethe  salpeter equations for quarks and diquarks which interact via quark exchange  @xcite .",
    "once the full three  quark problem has been reduced to an effective two  body problem , the only model ingredients are the ( di)quark propagators along with the quark  diquark vertices .",
    "it is hoped for that further progress in the study of the qcd quark propagator and two  quark correlations will eventually justify the reduction to quarks and diquarks in this approach to describe baryons .",
    "actual calculations utilize either simplifying assumptions or phenomenological parameterizations of the respective propagators and interaction vertices of quarks and diquarks . by choosing the simplest _ anstze _ , _ i.e. _ free spin1/2 and spin0/spin1 propagators for quarks and diquarks , respectively ,",
    "various spacelike nucleon form factors have been successfully reproduced  @xcite .",
    "however , the nave use of perturbative ( di)quark propagators leads to asymptotic states in the spectrum that carry the respective quantum numbers .",
    "hence baryons would decay into quarks unless kinematically bound .",
    "this decay process would contradict the confinement phenomenon . in this paper",
    "we will therefore investigate the possibility of incorporating confinement into the diquark model by suitable modifications of the quark and diquark propagators .",
    "essentially these propagators are modified by multiplicative dressing functions to completely remove the poles that occurred in the perturbative propagators at the ( di)quark masses .",
    "this enables us to calculate the spectrum not only of octet but also decuplet baryons  @xcite .",
    "together with an _ ansatz _ for the quark  diquark bound state wave  function of the nucleon ( faddeev amplitude ) such pole  free propagators have already been used to calculate nucleon form factors in the spacelike regime  @xcite . unfortunately in this context",
    "the computation of the electro ",
    "weak form factors is not as simple as merely modifying the propagators .",
    "since gauge invariance relates off  shell propagators and vertices it is obvious that any change in the propagators requires modifications of the effective interaction with the electro ",
    "weak gauge bosons  @xcite . when incorporating gauge invariance in the model with free propagators the nucleon isovector magnetic moments come out too small by about 30%",
    "unless model parameters are used that do not properly reproduce the baryon spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , these unacceptable parameters result from requiring the @xmath2isobar to be kinematically bound against its decay into free quarks . it is hoped for that when modeling confinement the results on the magnetic moments will also improve due to the modifications of the photon vertices which are mandatory when employing dressed ( di)quark propagators .",
    "a very serious disadvantage of the lack of confinement is that hadronic reactions with _",
    "momenta of the order of @xmath3 transferred to the nucleon , _",
    "e.g. _ meson production processes , can not be described properly .",
    "again , the free  particle poles of quark and diquark cause unphysical thresholds in these processes that are triggered by the poles in the propagators . an appropriate modification of these propagators would not only remove the unphysical thresholds but also serve as an effective description of the strong interaction",
    ". certainly , a relativistic description of such processes would be very desirable . at present",
    ", the covariant diquark model appears to be the only relativistic one that is both , feasible and applicable at this energy scale .",
    "as already mentioned we wish to eliminate the singularities associated with real timelike momenta in the ( di)quark propagators that would lead to imaginary parts in those @xmath4matrix elements that are calculated from diagrams containing internal quark loops .",
    "so , either these singularities are absent or their contributions cancel in some manner  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behavior described can be encoded in the following models ( which are certainly not the only possibilities ) for the quark propagator in euclidean space , @xmath5 with @xmath6      \\label{f2}\\ ; , \\\\    f_3 ( x , x^\\ast ) & = & \\tanh\\left [ d\\left(1+x\\right )           \\left(1+x^\\ast\\right ) \\right ] \\ ; .",

    "@xmath7 represents a parameter that would be interpreted as the quark mass if and only if the poles were on the real axis . in another scenario  ( [ f2 ] ) ,",
    "the dressing functions are chosen such that the propagators are entire functions and non  trivial in the whole complex plane  @xcite .",
    "if they are required to be analytic , they must possess an essential singularity , at least for infinite arguments .",
    "third , it might be helpful to approximate propagators by non ",
    "analytic functions  ( [ f3 ] ) and constrain them such that they asymptotically behave like @xmath8 for both , large spacelike and timelike momenta .",
    "since we enforce the propagators to be free of poles , they must be non ",
    "analytic functions depending on both the particle momentum @xmath9 and its complex conjugate  @xmath10 .",
    "consequently the quark  photon and quark  meson vertices are non  analytic and , even worse , translation invariance is lost in the solutions to the nucleon bethe ",

    "using the above given scenarios for implementing the confinement phenomena at the level of propagators this will set the stage for the main topic of our paper : the sensitivity of the predicted observables on the various effective parameterizations of confinement .",
    "these parameterizations concern the structure of the ( di)quark propagators for complex momenta . in section  [ relevance",

    "note that the choice @xmath49 and @xmath50 corresponds to the free propagators of spin0 and spin1 particles . as a major purpose of the present paper we will study various deviations from the free propagators as an avenue to mimic confinement . in general , the dressing functions @xmath51 are different in the scalar and axialvector channels as well as they are distinct from the one for the quark propagator .",
    "for simplicity , however , we will assume identical functions for all propagators . as we will not consider any axialvector diquark loops it is sufficient for the present purpose to use @xmath52 , see ref .",

    "these vertex functions have a finite extension in momentum space and fall off fast enough to render all integrals finite .",

    "note that by parameterizing the quark ",
    "quark @xmath29matrix we do not make any reference to the nature of the relevant quark  quark interaction .",
    "for example , to quantitatively include pionic effects we would have to solve dyson ",

    "studies within the nambu  jona  lasinio model using diquark  quark correlations either in a soliton background  @xcite or with explicit pion interaction between the quarks  @xcite lead to a substantial gain in the binding energy .",
    "since we determine the coupling constant @xmath73 from the nucleon mass , those studies suggest that the inclusion of pion degrees of freedom would merely lead to a shift of this constant .",
    "equipped with the separable form of the two  quark correlations , see eq  ( [ tsep ] ) , and the functional form of the scalar and axialvector diquark correlations in eqs  ( [ dqvertex_s],[dqvertex_a ] ) , we will set up the effective bethe - salpeter equation for the nucleon .",

    "this independence is exactly what one observes in the numerical solutions of the bse , provided the analytic form of the dressing functions , eq  ( [ f0])([f2 ] ) , is used .",

    "the structure of the equations for the octet baryons is similar to that of the nucleon  ( [ bse_nuc ] ) .",

    "these equations are given in full detail in refs .",

    "the vertex  ( [ pisa.vert ] ) describes the coupling of the diquarks to the derivative of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "such a construction is suggested by the chiral structure of the strong interactions that can be written as expansion in the derivatives of the goldstone bosons , at least in the chiral limit .",
    "having collected all ingredients we may now proceed and compute the diagrams in figure  [ sff_diag ] . according to the mandelstam formalism @xcite",
    "the diagram shown in the left panel translates into an expression of the form @xmath147 where we only indicated the general structure , _",
    "i.e. _ we omit indices that are associated to the coupling and propagation of axialvector diquarks .",
    "the conjugated vertex function , @xmath148 relates to the vertex function , @xmath94 as the conjugated wave function  ( [ psi_con ] ) to the wave function : @xmath149 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 when the involved diquark is respectively of scalar or axialvector type .",
    "we note that @xmath150 also solves the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation  ( [ bs2 ] ) .",
    "we denote the loop momentum by @xmath151 and introduce the momentum partition , @xmath152 again , @xmath84 $ ] is the momentum partition parameter . for the diagram in the right panel quark and diquark",
    "propagators need to be exchanged .",
    "in this section we will discuss that regime in the complex momentum plane where we need to know the quark and diquark propagators in order to solve the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation  ( [ bse_nuc ] ) and compare that regime to the one that enters the computation of the production processes like @xmath135 and @xmath153 . in principle these propagators can be calculated using dyson ",
    "schwinger equations@xcite and also respective lattice measurements should be available in the near future ; for preliminary results see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "both methods comprise the non  perturbative dynamics and should therefore give the basic ingredients to describe hadrons as bound state of quarks .",
    "however , both approaches are set up in euclidean space and one has to revert to extrapolations when the propagators are demanded for timelike momenta .",
    "if we wanted to perform an appropriate analytic continuation from euclidean back to minkowski space we would even require the propagators in a region of the complex momentum plane . in order to calculate amplitudes of physical processes between on  shell particles using the euclidean bethe ",
    "salpeter formalism the temporal components of the external momenta must be purely imaginary . in this framework",
    "the momenta become complex . in these calculations",
    "therefore the structure of the propagators in the complex momentum plane is essential .",
    "furthermore , it is important for the phenomenological parameterization of confinement .",
    "as repeatedly mentioned we comprehend the confinement phenomenon as the absence of poles on the timelike @xmath154axis in the propagator of colored `` particles '' .    the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation is most conveniently solved in the rest frame of the bound state , @xmath155 . here",
    "we want to specifically discuss the kinematical domain that is probed by the ( di)quark propagators in the bound state rest frame . in eq  ( [ bse_nuc ] ) the loop momentum , @xmath125 , relative between quark and diquark is chosen to be real .",
    "hence the temporal component of the quark momentum @xmath156 becomes complex .",
    "the values of @xmath157 that are covered when integrating over @xmath125 lie within a parabola that opens towards the spacelike axis , _ cf . _ figure  [ prod_kinem ] .",
    "the intercept of the parabola with the real axis is at ( small ) timelike @xmath158 .",
    "thus , solving the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation mainly probes the behavior of the quark propagator for spacelike momenta .",
    "since mainly the spacelike momenta are relevant , the propagators that are parameterized by the dressing function ( [ f2 ] ) approach the free propagators in the limit @xmath159 . in this limit the dressing functions ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) approach the bare propagators , both in the spacelike and timelike regions .    0.5 cm",
    "next we will explore the @xmath154 regime relevant for production processes like kaon photoproduction .",
    "the contribution to the reaction @xmath160 that involves a quark loop is shown in the left panel of figure  [ kaon_hand_bag ] .",
    "it turns out that it suffices to consider a parabola shaped region of the complex @xmath154plane ( _ i.e. _ it is sufficient to consider only this momentum and ignore the others ) .",
    "this can be understood in at least two ways : we could use the wave ",
    "functions rather than the vertex  functions for the calculation of the diagram . in this case",
    "the propagators that depend on @xmath161 and @xmath124 are included in the wave  functions and there would be no necessity to treat them separately .",
    "nevertheless , considering the propagators @xmath162 and @xmath163 separately we find that among all the internal momenta in the diagram it is @xmath151 that reaches farthest in the timelike regime . thus the following analysis for @xmath123 and",
    "@xmath164 would yield less restrictive conditions .    from the momentum routing",
    "shown in the left panel of figure  [ kaon_hand_bag ] we have : @xmath165 where @xmath33 is the momentum partition parameter ( @xmath166 ) while @xmath167 refers to the loop momentum .",
    "we chose the loop momentum to be real which implies that the external momenta like @xmath35 and @xmath168 must have an imaginary temporal component in order to correspond to physical particles .",
    "0.5 cm    for the following kinematical considerations we choose the proton rest frame and take the photon to propagate along the @xmath169-axis , @xmath170 hence the momentum entering the quark propagator becomes @xmath171 where the real and imaginary parts of @xmath154 have been separated .",
    "this shows that we need to know the propagator @xmath172 at complex @xmath154 in order to be able to compute the handbag diagram shown in the left panel of figure  [ kaon_hand_bag ] .",
    "the set of values of @xmath154 that occur has already been shown in figure  [ prod_kinem ] .",
    "the situation seems to be completely parallel to what we found for the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation ; in both cases we need to know the propagators in a parabola shaped region of the complex plane .",
    "the intercept with the imaginary axis is in both cases minus two times the intercept with the real axis .",
    "however , there is one important difference . for",
    "the production processes the intercept with the real axis does depend on the photon energy @xmath173 , more precisely : @xmath174 .",
    "thus for @xmath175 the computation of the handbag diagram shown in figure  [ kaon_hand_bag ] uses the same region of the complex plane that is necessary to solve the bethe  salpeter equation .",
    "however , for @xmath176 the parabola is shifted in the direction of the negative real axis .",
    "the threshold for kaon photoproduction is at @xmath173 slightly less than @xmath3 and the cross section has been measured @xcite up to @xmath177 .",
    "this implies that the handbag diagram ` probes ' the quark propagator _ much _ farther into the timelike region than the bethe  salpeter equation .",
    "the second production process we are especially interested in is associated strangeness production , @xmath21 .",
    "this reaction can be described similarly to the standard picture of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction by one  boson exchange .",
    "that is , one of the incoming protons acts as a meson source and the emitted off ",
    "shell meson couples to one of the constituents of the baryon ; the corresponding subprocess is shown diagrammatically in figure  [ kaon_hand_bag ] .    the analogous kinematical analysis for strangeness ",
    "production exhibits the same qualitative features .",
    "that process as well ` probes ' a parabola shaped subset of the complex plane , whereby the parabola is somewhat broader than the one in figure  [ prod_kinem ] .",
    "however , there again is an important difference : the parabola does extend only up to @xmath178gev@xmath179 into the timelike region .",
    "that is , the reaction @xmath21 ` probes ' the propagators in essentially the same region as the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation does .",
    "it is therefore not as sensitive as kaon photoproduction to the behavior of the propagator in the timelike region .",
    "the main conclusion of the above discussion is that certain production processes may be significantly more sensitive to the structure of the ( di)quark propagators than the bethe  salpeter equation and thus the baryon spectrum .",
    "hence the study of such processes should provide important information about these propagators .",
    "in this section we present the key issues of the formalism to compute the cross sections for kaon photoproduction , @xmath180 and the associated strangeness production , @xmath21 . in the diquark ",
    "quark model relatively few diagrams contribute to these processes and therefore we may analyze these reactions in detail . for further details on the definition of the involved observables and the relevant kinematics we refer the reader to appendix  [ app_product ] .    as already indicated in the discussion of the strong form factors we consider the pseudoscalar mesons as additional model degrees of freedom .",
    "this does not imply any double counting because the model interaction ( diquark exchange ) does not lead to bound ( would  be ) goldstone bosons .",
    "thus we also include intermediate pseudoscalar mesons at tree level when computing the above mentioned observables .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in figures  [ kp_photo_diag ] and [ pppkldiag ] . as a general remark",
    "we note that these diagrams need to be computed in any covariant diquark  quark model",
    ". however , the propagators that are essential components of these diagrams are specific to our model , _ cf . _ eqs  ( [ f0])([f3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the covariant wave or vertex  functions that also enter these diagrams are obtained as solutions of the bethe  salpeter equation . since",
    "this equation is subject to the model propagators they enter the calculation not only explicitly but also implicitly .",
    "1.0 cm      in this subsection we will discuss kaon photoproduction @xmath181 within our covariant diquark  quark model . some more details and technicalities of the calculation are given in appendix [ app_kapho ] .",
    "we show the dominant diagrams in figure  [ kp_photo_diag ] .",
    "the internal momenta of the ( uncrossed ) ` handbag diagram ' are defined according to @xmath182 here @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the momentum partition parameters of the proton and the @xmath100 , respectively .",

    "it reduces to the bare vertex in the limit that both momenta @xmath9 and @xmath151 are large .",
    "the ward identity constrains only the longitudinal part of the vertex .",
    "anstze _ for the transversal part of the vertex have been proposed ( _ cf .",
    "_ ref  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while those _ anstze _ solve problems related to multiplicative renormalizability and gauge invariance , the transversal part is generally assumed to be of minor influence on the resulting cross sections . thus we will henceforth neglect the transversal part of the quark ",
    "photon vertex .",
    "although the form of this vertex is not model specific , it contains the self  energy functions and thus it implicitly depends on the model propagators .",
    "the expression for the crossed handbag diagram can be easily inferred .",
    "the tree level diagram models the exchange of a virtual kaon and is expected to yield a non  negligible contribution for large photon energies . for the photon  meson coupling we use a bare vertex multiplied with the kaon electromagnetic form factor ( see appendix [ app_kapho ] ) while the meson ",
    "baryon vertex is proportional to @xmath191 that has been discussed in subsection  [ strongff ] .",
    "the ` handbag diagrams ' shown in figure  [ kp_photo_diag ] probe the propagators not only for spacelike momenta but also for comparably large timelike momenta , as we have emphasized in section  [ relevance ] .",
    "this sensitivity to the behavior of the propagators for timelike momenta distinguishes the reaction @xmath160 from most other production processes .      here",
    "we apply the covariant diquark  quark model to associated strangeness production , @xmath21 . again",
    ", some technicalities are relegated to appendix  [ ap_aspro ] .",
    "we describe the reaction @xmath21 as a sum over one  boson exchange contributions for which we consider the exchange of pions and kaons .",
    "the main contributions are shown in figure  [ pppkldiag ] .",
    "other diagrams like planar kaon exchange or crossed pion exchange with couplings to the quark are excluded by the flavor algebra .",
    "we neglect diagrams in which the exchanged particle and the emitted kaon couple to different constituents , because they imply a large relative momentum at the baryon vertex which is strongly suppressed .",
    "in addition we omit the direct coupling of the pion to the emitted kaon .",

    "conservation we only have to consider scalar  axialvector and axialvector  axialvector diquark transitions at any meson ",
    "diquark vertex .",
    "flavor algebra also shows that the axialvector diquark components of the incoming proton can not contribute in diagram # 4 .",
    "the diquark content of the diagrams shown in figure  [ pppkldiag ] is listed in table  [ tab_asstr_1 ] .",
    "counting the diquark combinations in table  [ tab_asstr_1 ] we arrive at 15 diagrams .",
    "this number is actually doubled because all diagrams have to be antisymmetrized with respect to the two incoming protons .    as an example , we outline the calculation of one of the two planar pion exchange diagrams .",
    "the calculation of the other diagrams is very similar .",
    "the amplitude of diagram # 1 can be factorized according to @xmath193 where @xmath194 denotes the form factor part and @xmath195 denotes the loop part of the diagram .",

    "the pion couples to the quark while the diquark acts as spectator . as discussed above such diagrams mainly produce @xmath100spins that are parallel to the spin of the incoming proton . on the contrary",

    "we observe that the parameter sets ( ii  iv ) predict cross sections that are comparable with the experimental data .",
    "these model calculations do not include axialvector diquarks .",
    "once these degrees of freedom are taken into account ( sets v and vi ) , the cross  section is overestimated by about a factor four .",
    "for the five sets ii  vi we find that the total cross section is strongly dominated by the kaon  exchange diagram ( _ cf .",

    "tuning the model propagators such that the two diagrams are of equal importance this dip could be reproduced @xcite .",
    "as it has been the case for the associated strangeness production we find that utilizing an exponential dressing function ( set i ) widely overestimates the experimental data . in this case",
    "actually the handbag diagrams dominate while the kaon exchange contributions are comparatively tiny .",
    "figure  [ tot_sig ] clearly shows that the large disagreement of the model results with the data certainly is not a fine  tuning problem .",
    "rather we must conclude that the comparison with data rules out propagators that strongly rise in the timelike region as the one dressed by an exponential function does .",
    "contrary to the case considered above the kaon exchange diagram exceeds the handbag diagram by almost one order of magnitude for the parameter sets ii ",
    "possible corrections from subleading meson amplitudes in the kaon ",

    "nucleon@xmath100 form factor in a similar fashion as they do for the pion ",
    "nucleon form factor .    in figure  [ tot_sig ]",
    "we also present the differential cross section in the energy interval @xmath261 as a function of the angle between the momenta of the initial proton and the final kaon in the center of mass frame , _ cf . _ appendix  [ app_product ] .",
    "although the model calculations reproduce the empirical increase of the differential cross section as @xmath262 goes from minus to plus unity , the increase appears to be overestimated . for those parameter sets ( ii  vi ) for which the resulting cross sections are dominated by the kaon exchange diagrams the predicted differential cross sections turn out too small in the backward scattering region while they are too big in the opposite direction . as a result",
    "the total cross section agrees with the empirical data reasonably well .",
    "again , the exponential type propagators yield differential cross sections that are way off the data and we repeatedly conclude that this type of propagators is ruled out .",
    "we have also computed the asymmetries that are defined in eqs  ( [ p_asym])([s_asym ] ) .",
    "we find that they essentially vanish for the model propagators that we consider reasonable , _",
    "i.e. _ sets ii  vi .",
    "although the model calculation correctly predicts that the polarized photon asymmetry @xmath210 , see eq  ( [ s_asym ] ) , is positive for @xmath263 and negative otherwise , the absolute values are off by several orders of magnitude . only when substituting propagators that are characterized by the exponential dressing function the predicted asymmetries roughly agree with the empirical data .",
    "however , we have discarded already that propagator for other reasons given above .",
    "in this paper we have considered baryons as fully relativistic bound states of quarks and separable quark ",
    "quark correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ , diquarks .",
    "the main purpose of this study has been to utilize empirical information in order to restrict the structure of the propagators that model confined quarks and diquarks .",
    "these propagators enter the four  dimensional bethe ",
    "salpeter equations from which we have computed the mass eigenvalues and wave functions that are associated with physical baryons .",
    "the full covariance of the model wave functions allows us to unambiguously calculate form factors up to momentum transfers of several @xmath264 . for spacelike momenta",
    "the empirical form factors can be very well reproduced with tree ",
    "level quark and diquark propagators  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the description of processes involving timelike momenta is obscured by the presence of quark thresholds in the tree ",
    "level propagators . of course , these thresholds are unphysical and reflect the absence of confinement .",
    "it is thus appropriate to modify these tree ",
    "level propagators in order to implement the confinement phenomenon . in this framework",
    "we have considered three qualitatively different cases : in the first case , the tree ",
    "level poles at timelike real @xmath265 have been traded for a pair of complex  conjugate poles . in this case",
    "the imaginary parts ( and therefore thresholds ) cancel . in the second scenario ,",
    "the pole on the timelike real @xmath265 axis has been screened at the expense of an essential singularity for infinite timelike momenta . in the third case ,",
    "we have emphasized the issue that the propagators should equal the tree ",
    "level ones for all complex values of @xmath265 as @xmath266 . together with the condition that no poles occur this property enforces a non  analytic form .",
    "we have then investigated the phenomenological implications of either of these forms rather than attempting to precisely reproduce the experimental data . obviously , those processes are most interesting whose computation involves timelike momenta of the order of one gev entering the model propagators . in diquark models",
    "the flavor algebra alleviates the calculation of processes with a @xmath100 hyperon in the final channel .",
    "we have therefore focused on kaon photoproduction and associated strangeness production with the photoproduction being , at least in principle , more sensitive to timelike momentum transfers .",
    "the model parameters have been fixed by fitting the baryon spectrum and the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "both , the results for the magnetic moments of the nucleon and those for the ratio @xmath226 show that it is important to include contributions from the axialvector diquark . the strong form factors @xmath267 and @xmath191 for",
    "spacelike momenta @xmath268 depend on the amount of admixture of axialvector diquarks in the baryon wave functions .",
    "our numerical result for @xmath269 using both , scalar and axialvector diquarks , overestimates the empirically determined value by approximately  30% .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is the omission of subleading amplitudes in the pion ",
    "quark vertex .",
    "future calculations should therefore include these contributions and the ones from the kaon ",
    "quark vertex as well . in any event , all these observables are almost insensitive to the specific structure of the propagators .",
    "therefore they do not provide an adequate tool to distinguish between different parameterizations of the confinement phenomenon .",
    "the production processes , on the other hand , strongly depend on the form of the propagators in the timelike region . in particular we have observed that the class of propagators that is characterized by an exponential growth for large timelike momenta overestimates the cross sections by orders of magnitude .",
    "we have associated this failure to the dominance of the handbag  type diagram .",
    "apparently any quark propagator that for timelike momenta is significantly more enhanced than the tree ",
    "level one immediately implies the dominance of this diagram .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that those propagators should be discarded .",
    "the other two forms of the propagators have the potential to describe the data reasonably well .",
    "as mentioned , we have omitted the so far undetermined subleading contributions in the kaon exchange diagram that dominates the kaon photoproduction amplitude . from the discussion of the pion form factor",
    "we have sufficient reason to believe that the inclusion of such contributions will favor parameter sets that contain axialvector diquarks .",
    "although the non  analytic form for the propagator could not be ruled out by quantitative arguments we nevertheless think it should be discarded , because it poses several fundamental problems related with gauge and translational invariance which we have detailed in the text . therefore propagators that are characterized by pairs of complex conjugated poles seem to be best suited for further studies .",
