    "quasielastic scattering of protons on nuclei is an attractive phenomenon for the study of the basic nucleon - nucleon interaction in the nuclear medium , because it exhibits the approximate behavior of the scattering of a nucleon on only one nucleon of the target nucleus .",
    "quasielastic scattering has been modeled by the relativistic plane wave impulse approximation @xcite which considers it as a single - step process , whereby the projectile interacts with only one nucleon of the target nucleus , while the rest of the nucleons remain inert .",
    "the well known and outstanding success of the original rpwia was its prediction of the analyzing power for @xmath1 and @xmath2 at 500 mev ; a case in which all non - relativistic models failed @xcite .    in the rpwia approach",
    ", the description of the initial and final free particle in the medium is based on mean - field theory , as described by serot and walecka in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the rpwia model",
    "the associated dirac plane waves have their free nucleon mass decreased by the real part of the average nuclear scalar field to yield an effective nucleon mass .",
    "the values of the effective masses serve as an indicator of the nuclear medium effects on the nn interaction .    in former theoretical studies of scattering",
    "@xcite the nucleon - nucleon scattering matrix @xmath3 was parameterized in terms of the five fermi covariants which is commonly referred to as the spvat form of @xmath4 or the ia1 model",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that eventhough the spvat form gave reasonable results for elastic and quasileastic scattering observables , it is in principle not correct , since as was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a five - term representation of the relativistic nn scattering matrix is necessarily ambiguous . in addition , tjon and wallace @xcite have shown that a general lorentz invariant representation of @xmath4 ( referred to as the ia2 model ) contains additional terms that can not be neglected .",
    "the ia2 representation of @xmath4 contains , in fact , 44 independent invariant amplitudes , instead of the previously used five , which are consistent with parity and time - reversal invariance as well as charge symmetry together with the on - mass - shell condition for the external nucleons .",
    "comparison to the limited data available with subsequent and more refined calculations @xcite have also revealed that quasielastic @xmath5 and @xmath6 prefer different five - term representations of @xmath4 : the @xmath7 data favor a pseudovector @xmath8 coupling , whereas the @xmath5 data are consistent with a pseudoscalar term for the @xmath8 vertex .",
    "therefore , the most basic question which has to be addressed is the representation of the nn scattering matrix .    in the current application of the rpwia to quasielastic scattering ,",
    "the following components play a key role :    1 .",
    "the amplitudes in the basic two - nucleon interaction , which are partly determined from free nn scattering data and partly from a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation employing a meson - exchange model for the nn force .",
    "the lorentz covariant set constructed from the dirac matrices which serves as a representation for @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   the effective nucleon mass for both projectile and target nucleons interacting in the nuclear medium .    in this paper",
    "a theoretical formalism is presented for the calculation of calculate polarization transfer observables for quasielastic proton - nucleus scattering using a general lorentz invariant representation of the nn scattering matrix @xcite ; a systematic survey of the predictive power of the model compared to data will be presented in a future paper . by adhering to the symplifying features of the rpwia",
    ", one can focus on the basic nn interaction without introducing additional complications .",
    "a complete and unambiguous expansion of @xmath4 allows for a correct incorporation of medium effects ( within the rpwia framework ) and therefore one can distinguish between experimental results which are genuine medium effects and those which arise due to other effects not taken into account by the rpwia . in section [ section_rpwia ]",

    "the rpwia models quasielastic scattering as a single - step process whereby the projectile knocks out a single bound nucleon from the nucleus .",
    "the rest of the nucleons are assumed to remain inert , but their effect is taken into account in that the free mass of the projectile and target nucleons are shifted to _ effective masses _ , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . in the context of the walecka model @xcite the effective masses",
    "can both be calculated microscopically as follows : for the projectile , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the free nucleon mass , @xmath23 is the average value over the whole nucleus of the real part of the scalar potential found by weighting it with @xmath24 , the transmission probability through the nucleus at an impact parameter @xmath25 , and with the nuclear density @xmath26 for the specific nucleus @xcite .",
    "the effective mass of the target nucleon is determined from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scalar meson coupling constant and @xmath29 is the scalar field for the specific nucleus with the averaging done as described above .",

    "experimental data seem to suggest that the spin observables are target independent @xcite , and therefore we assume , as a first step , a fermi - gas approximation for the target nucleus .",
