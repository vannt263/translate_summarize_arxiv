    "this _ letter _ contains the classification of power spectral features in gx 340 + 0 and a determination of the @xmath0invariant using observational data from jonker et al .",
    "psaltis , belloni & van der klis ( 1999 ) discussed many similarities and correlations between the qpo frequencies in atoll sources , z - sources and black hole candidates , which may be related to the similar phenomena and physical processes occurring in all of these systems .",
    "in addition , wijnands & van der klis ( 1999 ) found that the break frequency of the broken power law which describes the power spectrum correlates well with the frequencies of the peaked noise components observed in atoll sources and black hole candidates .",
    "titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ; hereafter to99 ) attempted to classify qpo frequencies using the basic properties of accretion flow around compact objects .",
    "the first property is an adjustment of the keplerian flow in the disk to the sub - keplerian inner boundary condition ( titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 , hereafter tlm98 ) , which is a common phenomenon for neutron star ( ns ) and black hole candidate systems . in this respect",
    "all correlations between the break frequencies @xmath3 and low qpo frequencies @xmath4 should be similar in both types of system because they are related to the diffusion and oscillation time scales in the transition region between the keplerian flow and the rotational inner boundary ( either the ns surface or the inner edge of the accretion flow in bh systems ) .",
    "later the predicted correlation was confirmed by ford & van der klis ( 1998 ) who analyzed rxte data from 4u 1728 - 32 .",
    "furthermore , in to99 the authors demonstrated that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related through the power law @xmath5 which fits to the data in most bh and ns systems ( wijnands & van der klis , 1999 ) .",
    "the second property is an effect of the sub - keplerian rotating magnetosphere located above the disk .",
    "osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999a , hereafter ot99a ) suggested that the radial oscillations of the fluid element bounced from the disk shock region ( presumably at the adjustment radius ) would be seen as two independent oscillations in the radial and the vertical directions due to the presence of coriolis force in the magnetospheric rotational frame of reference .",
    "the observed evolution of two khz peaks allows one to infer the profile of the differentially rotated magnetosphere and then to verify it using the observed correlation of the horizontal branch quasi - periodic oscillations ( hbo ) frequencies with the low khz peak .    in a black hole system",
    "the corona above the disk should also rotate with less than keplerian velocity .",
    "when oscillating fluid elements of the disk are thrown to the corona , these oscillators would be under the influence of the coriolis force which leads to the same rotational splitting effect ( ot99a ) seen in the ns systems .",
    "the main qpo keplerian frequency would be split into two frequencies , the hybrid and low branch related to the radial and vertical oscillations respectively in the rotational frame of references .",
    "the recent discovery of a 450 hz qpo ( strohmayer 2001 ) in addition to the previously reported 18 and 300 hz ( remmilard 1999 ) in gro j1655 - 40 provides additional support for the rotational splitting effect .",
    "there are three other qpo models in the literature .",
    "the first one is the beat frequency model suggested by alpar & shaham ( 1985 ) , and recently modified as a sonic - point beat frequency model by miller , lamb & psaltis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the second is the relativistic precession model proposed by stella & vietri ( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the third is the inner accretion disk model promoted by psaltis & norman ( 2000 ) .",
    "all observational arguments for these models and their problems are discussed in detail by wu ( 2001 ) where these models are also compared with the transition layer model ( tlm ) ( tlm98 , to99-ot99a ) .",
    "we do not go into the details of this comparison in this letter but we do give more arguments for tlm in terms of the new qpo data for gx 340 + 0 ( jonker et al .",
    "2000 , here after j00 ) .    precise simultaneous measurements of the frequencies of the two khz qpos and hbo harmonics in a wide frequency range for gx 340 + 0 ( j00 )",
    "give us an opportunity to derive the @xmath0invariant .",
    "in osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 , hereafter ot99b ) , the authors demonstrated for the source 4u 1702 - 42 that the inferred angle @xmath2 , ( see eq 2 , 5 in ot99b ) @xmath6\\ ] ] depends only on _ observed frequencies : _ the low and high khz qpo peaks @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the hbo ( the low branch ) peak @xmath9 .",
    "it stays the same ( @xmath10 ) over significant range of @xmath7 ( 650 - 900 hz ) .",
    "using a series of observations where @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 are detected simultaneously [ van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; markwardt , strohmayer & swank 1999 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ; j00 ) ] we check that the angle @xmath2 is a true invariant for four specific sources : sco x-1 , 4u 1702 - 42 , 4u 0614 + 09 and gx 340 + 0 ( see  2 ) .",
    "we present the magnetospheric rotational profile for gx 340 + 0 inferred from j00 data in  3 . using this profile and the @xmath2 value we will reproduce the theoretical dependence of the low branch on the low khz frequency in  4 and compare it with the j00 observations .    according to the tlm ,",
    "also known as `` two - oscillator model '' all frequencies ( namely @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) have specific dependences on @xmath7 .",
    "the comprehensive summary of the tml model and its successes to date is present in titarchuk & osherovich ( 2000a )    in  5 we offer the full classification of the qpo frequencies containing six branches which fit to the data with at most one ( constrained ) parameter .",
    "discussion and summary follow in the last section .",
    "we have used the frequencies measured for sources gx 340 + 0 , 4u 0614 + 09 , sco x-1 and 4u 1702 - 42 where the low and high khz qpo peaks @xmath7 and @xmath8 and hbo frequencies @xmath9 are measured simultaneously .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath2 calculated from eq .",
    "( 1 ) are shown in figure 1 . indeed , for each of these sources , the @xmath0values show little variation with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "they are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , for 4u 1702 - 42 , sco x-1 and 4u 0614 + 09 respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath2 obtained for the source gx 340 + 0 is @xmath14 and is similar to the values obtained for sco x-1 and 4u 1702 - 42 .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0invariant predicted by the tlm [ ot99b , titarchuk & osherovich ( 2000b here after to00 ) ] is a challenge for any other qpo model .",
    "it is important to note that _ all frequencies included in this @xmath0relation are observed frequencies and thus the relation eq .",
    "( 1 ) is a model independent invariant_. it is worth pointing out once again that the @xmath15angle varies from source to source .",
    "in fact , wu ( 2001 ) confirms the existence of the delta - invariant for three more sources ",
    "cyg x-2 , gx 17 + 2 and gx 5 - 1 , using the rxte observational data obtained by psaltis et al . ( 1999 ) , wijnands et al .",
    "( 1998a , b , 1997 ) . for all these sources",
    "the @xmath0angle is about @xmath16 which is very close to that obtained for sco x-1 and gx 340 + 0 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath0 determination is of order 5% .",
    "from the observed khz frequencies ( j00 , table 3 ) , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , the profile of @xmath17 has been calculated according to @xmath18^{1/2},\\ ] ] and modeled using the theoretically inferred magnetic multipole structure of a differentially rotating magnetosphere ( ot99a ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 . the constants @xmath21 hz , @xmath22 hz@xmath23 , @xmath24 hz@xmath25 and @xmath26 hz@xmath27 have been obtained by a least - squares fit with @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 profile for gx 340 + 0 is very similar to those of 4u 1608 - 52 , and sco x-1 ( see ot99a , figs .",
    "the gx 340 + 0 data of j00 allows one to check the prediction of the model for the low branch frequency @xmath30 . taking the profile of @xmath31 , ( eq .",
    "3 ) , we plot @xmath30 in figure 2 . fixing @xmath32 , we find that our plot for @xmath9 and @xmath33 , calculated according to formula ( ot99a , eq .",
    "9 ) @xmath34 fits the data for the observed frequencies of ( 20 - 40 ) hz and ( 40 - 80 ) hz respectively .",
    "there are three observational points in figure 2 ( square points with error bars ) which we interpret as the second harmonics @xmath33 .",
    "the first harmonics @xmath9 for these frequencies are not observed by j00 and they are obtained using @xmath33 and presented as squares without error bars .",
    "the error bars of the observational points shown by circle marks are less than the mark size in most cases .",
    "it is worth noting that the observational points follow the theoretically predicted curve , which shows the signs of saturation at high @xmath7 .",
    "the same type of behavior of @xmath9 vs @xmath7 is also seen in the sco x-1 data .",
    "further tests of the tlm can be done using a comparison of the observed correlations of break and viscous qpo frequencies vs khz qpo frequencies ( j00 ) with the theoretical dependences derived in tlm98 and to99 . in figure 3 ( the classification plot ) , we present the theoretical curves calculated using eqs .",
    "( 9 , 12 - 13 ) in to99 using the dimensionless parameter @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the neutron star ( ns ) spin , @xmath37 is the ns mass in the solar masses , @xmath38 is the ns radius in units of schwarzchild radii . in to00 ( eq .",
    "4 ) we approximate the solution of eq ( 9 ) of to99 by a polynomial @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the normalization of the theoretical curve is controlled by the constant @xmath42 ( to00 ) which reflects the properties of the specific source .",
    "for instance , for 4u 1728 - 34 the observed frequencies are fitted by the curve ( to99 ) for which the constant @xmath43 and @xmath44 km for 1.4 solar masses ( see to00 , eq .",
    "2 ) . it should be pointed out that the ns spin for 4u 1728 - 34 is known to be @xmath45 hz . for gx 340 + 0",
    "we fit the data points by curves with the parameter @xmath46 hz for which the corresponding constant @xmath47 . for the source",
    "gx 340 + 0 we found the lebesgue s measure ( for a definition , see titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov 1999 , hereafter tok ) is 16% for @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , the theoretical curves are functions of two parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath36 , and for ( a given ) @xmath49 that curve with @xmath50 can be obtained by scaling the argument ( see to00 ) .    according to solutions presented in to99 and tok , the break frequency @xmath3 correlates with the low lorentzian frequency @xmath4 ( which we interpreted as a viscous frequency in the tl model ) through the power law relation @xmath51 using the data of wijnands & van der klis ( 1999 )",
    "it was confirmed in tok that approximately the same index is valid for most ns and bh objects .",
    "we have also found that the observed correlation of @xmath3 vs @xmath4 in gx 340 + 0 is well described by the same power law dependence ( eq .",
    "5 ) but with a proportionality coefficient @xmath52 ( which is twice more than that for 4u 1728 - 34 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath53 vs @xmath7 is shown in figure 3 by the red curve . to fit the theoretical curve to the data we use only those data points which were specified by j00 as the new discovered frequencies .",
    "they pointed out that these frequencies well close to half that of the hbo .",
    "however looking at the classification in figure 3 we argue that these power spectral features are the same low noise component frequencies  in our terms , @xmath53 that were found by ford and van der klis ( 1998 ) in 4u 1728 - 34 and by tok in sco x-1 .",
    "furthermore , we have found that at least two power spectra features which were identified by j00 as the break frequencies also belong to the viscous branch .",
    "the appropriate points are denoted by triangle marks in fig .",
    "3 .    the dependences of @xmath3 and @xmath53 on @xmath7 allow us to retrieve information regarding the turbulent scale @xmath54 , the sonic velocity @xmath55 , the magnetic field strength and structure in the transition layer .",
    "we discuss these issues in detail in titarchuk , bradshaw & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "wu ( 2001 ) uses the @xmath56prescription ",
    "i.e. @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a half - thickness of the disk  to specify the absolute value of the viscous frequency @xmath53 . however we argue that the introduction of one more free parameter ( @xmath59 ) in tl model is not necessary and furthermore it leads to very small values of kinematic viscosity , @xmath60 .",
    "one may conclude using wu s best - fit parameters of @xmath61 that @xmath62 is at least two orders of magnitude less than @xmath63 . on the other hand , the reynold s number @xmath64 is tightly constrained by the observed absolute values of khz frequencies ( tlm98 , fig .",
    "3 ) and one can find that @xmath65",
    ". in tlm98 authors have already realized this problem with the @xmath56 prescription and therefore they have not used it in the model .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have further verified predictions of the transition layer ( tl ) model for four sources by presenting our analysis of jonker et al.s gx 340 + 0 data .",
    "furthermore we demonstrate that the right classification of the power spectra features allows us to shed light on their nature and origin .",
    "the unifying characteristic of tlm is that all qpo features are natural and necessary consequence of the adjustment of keplerian disk to the sub - keplerian rotation of the neutron star . in the transition",
    "layer the interaction of the two oscillators may occur because they share the common boundary at the outer edge of the transition layer . in this case a strong dependence is supposed to exist between all frequencies in the tlm and the fundamental keplerian frequency @xmath7 at the tl outer edge . in our model , assuming high electric conductivity , we describe the frequency of the differential rotation of the magnetosphere @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that the ns magnetic field has a discontinuity in the equatorial plane similar to the discontinuity of the field in the equatorial plane of the solar corona and related current sheet in the heliosphere as described in the model of osherovich , tzur and gliner ( 1984 ) .",
    "both the current sheet and differential rotation are observed elements of solar corona and heliosphere ( e.g. hoeksema & scherrer 1987 , burlaga 1995 ) .",
    "the tlm model reveals the physical nature of the low branch ( hbo ) oscillation frequency as a low branch of the keplerian oscillator under the influence of the coriolis force . the angle @xmath2 as a global parameter describes the inclination of the magnetospheric equator to the equatorial plane of the disk . measured locally for different radial distances ( therefore different @xmath66 ) , @xmath2 may vary considerably if the observed oscillations do not correspond to the predicted low keplerian branch .",
    "the angle @xmath2 is calculated using the observed frequencies only .",
    "the constancy of @xmath2 shown in figure 1 argues in favor of our model .",
    "thus , if a similar rotational splitting effect occurs in bh systems , are the needed frequency trio simultaneously observed : a pair of high frequencies of order 200 - 300 hz ( for black hole with mass of 7 - 10 ) , and a low frequency close to 20 hz ?",
    "strohmayer ( 2001 ) reports precisely this case for bh candidate gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "he simultaneously observed three frequencies , 450 , 300 and 18 hz .",
    "if we assume the rotational splitting paradigm as an origin for these three frequencies , we can estimate the rotational frequency of the corona - configuration above the disk @xmath67 hz using the hybrid relation ( ot99 , eq .",
    "7 ) for @xmath68 hz and @xmath69 hz . furthermore ,",
    "if we assume that the corona configuration rigidly rotates with the black hole , we can estimate the bh dimensionless angular momentum @xmath70 .",
    "we have also assumed a bh mass of about seven solar masses .",
    "the low 18 hz frequency can be interpreted as the low branch qpo if @xmath71 ( see eq .",
    "1 ) , which is a typical for ns systems ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    strohmayer ( 2001 ) argues that the gro j1655 - 40 qpo data , with @xmath72 , could account for the higher frequency , 450 hz , when identified with the radial epicyclic frequency within relativistic disk models ( see e.g. stella , vietri & morsink 1999 ; psaltis & norman 2000 ; markovich 2000 ) .",
    "he also suggests that the 300 hz qpo is associated with lower khz qpos in neutron stars ( _ c.f .",
    "_ ot99 and psaltis et al 1999 ) .",
    "however , if this parallel between ns and bh systems assumes that the higher frequency qpo twin frequency is due to general relativity ( gr ) effects , the question arises of how this gr model works for ns systems when khz qpo frequencies of 400 - 500 h ( corresponding to 10 - 12 schwarzschild radii where gr effects are negligible ) are observed .",
    "such qpos , along with higher khz frequencies , are seen very often in ns systems ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . one may conclude that the association between qpos in ns and bhc along with their interpretation within the gr model is somewhat problematic .",
    "the observed correlations of the viscous and break frequencies versus khz qpo frequencies allow us to retrieve information about the ns spin .",
    "we found that for gx 340 + 0 as well as for sco x-1 the ns spin should be close to 360 hz which is similar to that measured directly in 4u 1728 - 34 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "on the other hand there is an indication ( to00 ) that the ns spin in 4u 0614 + 09 can be as high as 700 hz or more .",
    "the authors acknowledge discussions with joe fainberg , kent wood and reba bandyopadhyay .",
    "we are grateful to peter jonker for use of his data .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee for a thorough analysis of the paper content and constructive suggestions"
