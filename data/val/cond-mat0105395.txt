    "the reference homogeneous cooling state for a binary mixture has been discussed in detail recently @xcite to provide the proper basis for analysis of transport due to spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "those results are used here to describe mass , heat , and momentum transport .",
    "the expressions for the distribution functions , fluxes , and transport coefficients are exact to navier - stokes order ( within the context of the boltzmann equation ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for a binary mixture at low density are derived from the coupled set of boltzmann equations for the two species in the same manner as for a one component system .",
    "the solutions for the distribution functions are expanded about a local homogeneous cooling state that is analogous to the local equilibrium state for a gas with elastic collisions .",
    "the expansion is in powers of the spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields ( e.g. , species densities , temperature , and flow velocity ) and is an extension of the familiar chapman - enskog procedure for elastic collisions .",
    "the primary technical complication for inelastic collisions is an inherent time dependence of the reference state due to collisional cooling . in a one component system",
    "this occurs through the time dependence of the temperature defined in terms of the mean square velocity for the homogeneous cooling distribution .",
    "for a two component system the temperature is defined in terms of the algebraic average of the mean square velocities for the two distributions . in the case of elastic collisions",
    "the average temperature is the same as the kinetic temperatures for each species in the local equilibrium state .",
    "however , a surprising result of the study in ref .",
    "is that these temperatures are all different for inelastic collisions .",
    "this does not mean that there are additional hydrodynamic degrees of freedom since their cooling rates are the same and consequently , the partial kinetic temperatures still can be expressed in terms of the average temperature .",
    "but the relationships between these temperatures are functions of the densities for the two species and lead to a new dependence of the reference cooling states on these hydrodynamic variables .",
    "the consequences of this effect for the transport coefficients is significant , as shown below .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for a binary mixture are somewhat more complicated than for the one component case : six coupled equations with eight transport coefficients .",
    "the irreversible ( dissipative ) parts of the mass , heat , and momentum fluxes are calculated to leading order in the spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields . for systems with elastic collisions",
    "the specific set of gradients contributing to each flux is restricted by fluid symmetry , time reversal invariance ( onsager relations ) , and the form of the entropy production.@xcite for inelastic collisions only fluid symmetry applies so there is greater freedom in representing the fluxes and identifying associated transport coefficients .",

    "first , the macroscopic balance equations ( [ 2.9])([2.11 ] ) for number densities , total momentum and energy are obtained from the corresponding kinetic equation .",
    "next , the fluxes and cooling rate in these equations are determined from a solution of the coupled boltzmann equations given in terms of the hydrodynamic fields and their spatial gradients . the corresponding constitutive equations for the mass , heat and momentum fluxes",
    "are given to navier - stokes order by eqs .",
    "( [ n1])([n3 ] ) , and the associated transport coefficients are given by eqs .",
    "( [ 3.34])([3.36 ] ) , ( [ 3.37])([3.39 ] ) , and ( [ 3.40])([3.41 ] ) , respectively .",
    "these results are exact within the context of the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "a practical evaluation of these coefficients is possible by means of a sonine polynomial approximation and the derivation and approximate results are _ not _ limited to weak inelasticity .",
    "an exploration of the full parameter space ( mass ratio , diameters , concentrations , inelasticity parameters ) is straightforward but beyond the scope of this presentation .",
    "we intend to create a library of programs for calculation of distribution functions and transport coefficients in one and two component granular systems , available to the public on our web site .",
    "the chapman - enskog method provides an expansion of the distribution function for weak spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "this means that the relative spatial variation of all hydrodynamic fields must be small over distances of order of the mean free path .",
    "this encompasses a wide range of interesting phenomena , but excludes strongly driven systems such as those under steady shear . for such states",
    "it is not profitable to go beyond the order considered here in the chapman - enskog expansion , but rather to use other methods not based on small gradients .",
    "previous applications of the chapman - enskog method have typically introduced additional assumptions for convenience that are not internally consistent with constructing a solution to the boltzmann equation . in most of these cases",
    "the reference state was chosen to be a maxwellian , presumed to give accurate results at weak dissipation .",
    "this is not the case , as has been demonstrated in the one component case.@xcite in addition , the effects of cooling in the lowest order time derivative of the temperature and pressure were neglected , again under the assumption of weak dissipation . here , the reference state has been taken to be an exact solution to the uniform boltzmann equation and consequently , there is no limitation on the parameters of the system ( mass ratio , size ratio , concentrations , restitution coefficients )",
    ". an interesting and important result of this exact analysis is that the temperatures of each species must be different .",
    "furthermore , the time derivatives are calculated at each order in the gradient expansion without restriction on the restitution coefficients .",
    "this assures that a consistent solution to the boltzmann equation is constructed at each order in the gradients , without any restrictions on the system parameters .",
    "this consistency is reflected in the verification of solubility conditions for the integral equations determining the transport coefficients .",
    "these are the primary new features of this work .",
    "the evaluation of the transport coefficients for practical results introduces a new approximation , truncation of an expansion for the solutions to the integral equations in polynomials .",
    "the leading order truncation is known to be accurate to approximately five percent in the case of elastic collisions .",
    "exceptions are extreme mass ratios ( e.g. , electron - proton systems ) .",
    "its validity for inelastic systems has been recently checked by monte carlo simulation for shear viscosity .",
    "the accuracy is found to be similar to that for elastic collisions .",
    "recently , a seemingly similar analysis for granular binary mixtures has been given in ref .",
    ", also based on a two temperature description . however , this work is phenomenological with no attempt to solve the kinetic equation .",
    "instead , it is assumed that the distribution function is a local maxwellian .",
    "this is reasonably for estimating the dense gas collisional transfer contributions to the fluxes , but it predicts that all transport coefficients calculated here at low density should vanish . clearly , the phenomenology is flawed .",
    "in a next paper , we will evaluate the expressions for the different transport coefficients for a variety of mass and diameter ratios . here , as an illlustration and to give some insight into the influence of dissipation on transport",
    ", we consider the pressure diffusion coefficient @xmath199 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath146 .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , consider the case @xmath232 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the reduced pressure diffusion coefficient @xmath233 as a function of the restitution coefficient for @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and for two values of the mass ratio ( @xmath236 ) . here , @xmath237 is the pressure diffusion coefficient for elastic collisions .",
    "we see that the deviation from the functional form for elastic collisions is quite important even for moderate dissipation ( say @xmath238 ) .",
    "this tendency becomes more significant as the mass of the defect particles is larger than that of the excess particles .",
    "also shown for comparison in this fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the result for @xmath239 with @xmath240 , which would be obtained if the differences in the partial temperatures were neglected .",
    "clearly , inclusion of this effect makes a significant difference over the whole range of dissipation shown ( the actual value is @xmath241 for @xmath242 ) . at the level of the mass flux ,",
    "the main transport coefficient is the diffusion coefficient @xmath146 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the dependence of the ratio @xmath243 on @xmath244 for @xmath234 , @xmath245 , and for several values of the mass ratio ( @xmath246 ) . as before",
    ", @xmath247 is the diffusion coefficient for elastic collisions .",
    "the shape of these curves is very similar to those presented for the coefficient @xmath147 , although the influence of dissipation on @xmath146 is a bit stronger than the one observed in the case of @xmath147 .",
    "according to the behavior of @xmath146 and @xmath147 one can conclude that the main effect of inelasticity in collisions is to enhance the mass transport with respect to the elastic collisions case .",
    "the application of the chapman - enskog procedure here follows closely recent derivations of hydrodynamics and transport coefficients for one component granular gases .",
    "@xcite an important difference in the mixture is the need for two different temperatures in the reference local homogeneous cooling states , leading to qualitative differences in the concentration dependence of the transport coefficients relative to the elastic limit .",
    "this reference state is discussed in more detail in ref .   .",
    "effectively , the absence of energy conservation for granular gases leads to a failure of detailed balance between the velocity distributions in the homogeneous state .",
    "one consequence is non maxwellian distributions observed already for one component systems . for multicomponent systems a second consequence is different covariances of the distributions for different species , although the cooling rates are all equal .",
    "the latter property implies that the different partial temperatures can be expressed in terms of the global temperature ( as is required for a hydrodynamic description ) although the functional relationships defining such partial temperatures introduce a new dependence on the concentrations .",
    "this leads to additional spatial gradients at first order in the chapman - enskog expansion and consequently additional contributions to the transport coefficients .",
    "the effect of these terms can be significant , as illustrated in fig .",
    "previous work on granular mixtures @xcite is restricted by weak dissipation approximations .",
    "in addition , these studies do not include contributions from the partial temperature differences which are significant even for weak dissipation .",
    "one interesting question is whether the mixture hydrodynamics is more or less stable than that of the one component case , and if such phenomena as phase separation or segregation can occur .",
    "another direction of study is the extension of the present simple hydrodynamic state to higher densities based on the revised enskog kinetic equation , following recent results for the one component fluid .",
    "@xcite in this case the new complexity is due to the dependence of the collision operator on concentration through the pair correlation functions for the different species . finally , we hope that the present results stimulate the performance of computer simulations ( molecular dynamics and/or by using the direct simulation monte carlo method @xcite ) to study hydrodynamics in granular binary mixtures",
