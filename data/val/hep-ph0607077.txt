    "the discovery by belle @xcite of the anomalously narrow @xmath1 meson and of other hidden - charm states , in particular @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite , revitalized the experimental and theoretical interest in heavy quarkonium .",
    "the observation of @xmath1 has been confirmed by cdf @xcite , do @xcite and babar @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of interpreting these resonances as charmonium states are explained , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite . as alternatives",
    ", these resonances might be interpreted as tetraquarks , meson - meson molecules , hybrids , glueballs , etc . here",
    "we shall discuss the tetraquark option .",
    "the study of multiquark systems , as tetraquarks or hexaquarks has been initiated by jaffe @xcite in the mit bag model .",
    "later on it has been extended to potential models and applied to light scalar mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "subsequently heavy tetraquarks have been considered in search for stability @xcite .",
    "flux tube models @xcite suggested instability .    in a previous work we studied a light tetraquark system of identical particles in a standard nonrelativistic potential model with colour confinement and hyperfine chromomagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "our result showed explicitly the role of hidden colour states ( see below ) .",
    "subsequently we have studied the stability of a system of two light quarks @xmath6 and two heavy antiquarks @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath8 we performed a simple variational calculation with results comparable to other studies @xcite .",
    "we focused on the @xmath9 system because it has more of a chance to be bound than @xmath10 , the latter having a lower threshold .",
    "the argument was based on the following inequality @xcite @xmath11 valid for any value of the heavy - to - light mass ratio and where @xmath12 .",
    "this means that @xmath13 is a lower threshold than 2 @xmath14 .",
    "in addition the @xmath9 system is free of quark - antiquark annihilation processes which in @xmath10 can not be avoided .",
    "the open charm @xmath15 tetraquark with spin @xmath16 and isospin @xmath17 appears unbound in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the four - body problem was solved by an expansion in a harmonic - oscillator basis up to @xmath18 quanta .",
    "however , in the recent study of janc and rosina @xcite it is bound .",
    "this work , where a more sophisticated variational basis was used , has been inspired by the considerations made in ref .",
    "@xcite to include all possible channels which accelerate the convergence and in particular the meson  meson channels .    in the above calculations the potential of bhaduri et al .",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is of chromomagnetic type .",
    "the parameters include constituent quark masses , the string tension of a linear confinement , the strength of the coulomb interaction , and the strength and size parameter of the hyperfine interaction which is a smeared contact term .",
    "they were fitted over a wide range of mesons and baryons .    in this paper",
    "we use the classification of tetraquark states as given in refs .",
    "@xcite and a simple quark model to calculate the spectrum of @xmath19 tetraquarks and we discuss it in the light of recent data .",
    "here we suppose that particles 1 and 2 are quarks and particles 3 and 4 antiquarks , see fig .",
    "we define the basis states in the orbital , colour and spin space taking into account the pauli principle .",
    "the flavour space is trivial if we restrict to su(2 ) .",
    "the total wave function of a tetraquark is a linear combination of products of orbital , spin , flavour and colour parts .",
    "there are at least three possible ways to define the relative coordinates .",
    "the three relevant possibilities for our problem are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 the internal coordinates are @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 the first system of coordinates is convenient when the quarks or antiquarks are correlated to form diquarks , as in the diquark - antidiquark model . the coordinates ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are useful in describing the direct and exchange meson - meson channels _ i. e. _ the strong decays . one should use the system which is more appropriate for a given problem .",
    "but in specific calculations one can pass from one coordinate system to the other by orthogonal transformations . in the diquark - antidiquark picture the radial wave function can be written as a function of 6 variables @xmath25 but it can also be expressed in terms of coordinates ( [ direct ] ) or ( [ exchange ] ) . all channels which accelerate convergence should be included .",
    "the non - orthogonality between different @xmath26 functions can be handled without problems  @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ]          in the colour space one can construct a colour singlet tetraquark state using intermediate couplings associated to the three coordinate systems defined above . in this way one obtains three distinct bases .",
    "these are @xmath27 are antisymmetric and 6 and @xmath28 are symmetric under interchange of quarks or antiquarks .",
    "each set , ( [ directcolor ] ) or ( [ exchangecolor ] ) , contains a singlet - singlet colour and an octet - octet colour state .",
    "the amplitude of the latter vanishes asymptotically , when the mesons , into which a tetraquark decays , separate .",
    "these are called _ hidden colour _ states by analogy to states which appear in the nucleon - nucleon problem , defined as a six - quark system  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of hidden colour states to the binding energy of light tetraquarks has been calculated explicitly in ref .",
    "below we shall point out their crucial role in the description of @xmath19 tetraquarks",
    ".      as the quarks and antiquarks are spin 1/2 particles the total spin of a tetraquark can be @xmath29 or 2 . for @xmath30",
    "there are two independent basis states for each channel .",
    "the bases associated to ( [ diquark ] ) , ( [ directcolor ] ) and ( [ exchangecolor ] ) are @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for pseudoscalar and vector meson subsystems respectively and the lower index 0 indicates the total spin .",
    "the corresponding young tableaux for the states ( [ diquark0 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]    ) .",
    ", width=226 ]    for @xmath33 there are three independent states in each channel , to be identified by three distinct young tableaux @xcite . as an example we give the basis for the direct meson - meson channel @xcite @xmath34 the lower index indicates the total spin 1 .",
    "the permutation property under transposition ( 13 ) manifestly is @xmath35 and similarly for ( 24 ) @xmath36 with the identification 1 = @xmath37 , 2 = @xmath38 , 3 = @xmath39 and 4 = @xmath40 the permutation ( 13)(24 ) is equivalent to charge conjugation , reason for which the basis vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 defined below have charge conjugation @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 have charge conjugation @xmath48 .",
    "the case @xmath49 is trivial .",
    "there is a single basis state    @xmath50    which is symmetric under any permutation of quarks .",
    "below we shall first briefly describe the diquark - antidiquark model and next we shall calculate the full spectrum of tetraquarks @xmath51@xmath52 in the framework of a simple model .",
    "the diquark model for tetraquarks , named also exotic mesons , has been attractive for some time already .",
    "one obstacle is to estimate the mass of the diquark .",
    "a simple consistent picture has been given by lichtenberg et al .",
    "@xcite . in that context",
    "the mass of @xmath53 with diquarks of spin 0 and 1 was 3910 mev and that of @xmath54 with diquarks of spin zero 3920 mev .",
    "the heavy - light diquark picture of maiani et al .",
    "@xcite is more sophisticated .",
    "it contains explicitly a hyperfine interaction between quarks ( antiquarks ) and the diquarks have spin zero or one in all cases .",
    "however the colour space is truncated to @xmath55 so that the number of basis vectors is twice less than that presented in the following subsection .",
    "quarks the approximation is better . ]",
    "accordingly there are only two basis vectors for @xmath56 , one for @xmath57 , two for @xmath58 and one for @xmath59 , so that in the tetraquark spectrum there are twice less states than in fig . 3 below .",
    "the narrow decay width is explained by a rearrangement and by a `` bold guess '' of the coupling constant @xmath60 .",
    "here we use the simple model of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to point out the important role of hidden colour channels introduced above .",
    "accordingly the mass of a tetraquark is given by @xmath61 where    @xmath62    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcm ] ) contains the effective masses @xmath63 which incorporate the conventional constituent mass plus the kinetic energy and the confinement potential contributions .",
    "the constants @xmath64 represent the integral in the coordinate space of some unspecified analytic form of the one gluon - exchange potential and of spatial wave functions .",
    "a fit within @xmath65 mev to properties of charmed baryons gave the following parameters    @xmath66    for a tetraquark the possible states are @xmath67 and @xmath59 .",
    "in each case a basis can be built with ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,4 ) as quark - antiquark subsystems where each subsystem has a well defined colour , singlet or octet .",
    "this arrangement corresponds to @xmath68 + _ light meson _ channel .",
    "other intermediate couplings can also be defined , as for example , ( 1,4 ) and ( 2,3 ) which can correspond to the @xmath69 channel , when the total spin allows .",
    "one can pass from one coupling to the other , depending on the problem one looks at and also , for convenience in the calculations .",
    "for the colour - spin basis states we shall use the notation introduced in the previous section , i. e. @xmath70 for colour singlet and @xmath71 for colour octet subsystems and @xmath72 and @xmath73 for spin 0 and 1 respectively .    for @xmath56",
    "the basis constructed from products of states ( [ directcolor ] ) and ( [ directcolor0 ] ) is @xmath74 the chromomagnetic interaction hamiltonian with minus sign , -@xmath75 , acting on this basis leads to the following symmetric matrix + -20pt @xmath76@xmath76 for @xmath77 there are six linearly independent basis vectors built as products of colour ( [ directcolor ] ) and spin ( [ directcolor1 ] ) states . @xmath78 and @xmath79 have charge conjugation @xmath43 and the others @xmath48 .",
    "the 6 @xmath80 6 matrix of -@xmath81 can be found in ref .",
    "note that all matrix elements between states with opposite charge conjugation are naturally zero which means that the 6 @xmath80 6 matrix of ref .",
    "@xcite has a block - diagonal form .",
    "one block is the 2 @xmath80 2 submatrix for states of charge conjugation @xmath43 .",
    "this is + -20pt @xmath76@xmath76 which can be related to x(3872 ) .",
    "the other block is a 4 @xmath80 4 submatrix for states of charge conjugation @xmath48 , not written explicitly here , but which can be easily identified from ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath59",
    "the basis vectors are latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : deltai } \\hskip -10pt & \\delta_1 =    &   \\delta_2 =    @xmath49 spin state ( [ spin2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding 2 @xmath80 2 matrix is + -20pt @xmath76@xmath76 in the calculation of the matrix elements we have used the equalities @xmath83 due to charge conjugation .",
    "one can extend the observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath84 to @xmath85 states as well , namely the matrices of both @xmath84 and @xmath85 are diagonal provided the chromomagnetic interaction is the same for a quark - quark pair as for a quark - antiquark pair ,",
    "@xmath86 @xmath87 = @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the eigenvectors are either a pure colour singlet - singlet or a pure colour octet - octet state . in each case",
    "the pure octet - octet state is the lowest and obviously can not dissociate into a charmonium state and a vector meson .",
    "but if one allows for a difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , see parameters ( [ eq : par ] ) , then the lowest state receives a small singlet - singlet component which can then decay into @xmath89 or @xmath90 with a small width .",
    "such a description is very suitable for @xmath1 which has a width @xmath91 mev ( 95 % c.l . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "the states with @xmath92 can decay into @xmath93 + _ pseudoscalar meson _ as required by charge conjugation .",
    "there is no observation which can be associated to these states .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the calculated spectrum with the parameters ( [ eq : par ] ) . these parameters were obtained from a fit to charmed baryons , but determined within @xmath9410 mev .",
    "this means that the levels in fig .",
    "3 should be submitted to some uncertainties , not easy to be estimated .",
    "one can see that the 3910 mev @xmath84 level is close to @xmath1 but the 4057 mev @xmath85 level is about 100 mev above the observed @xmath2 resonance .    [ fig4 ]     tetraquarks , width=377 ]",
    "the work of ref . @xcite and",
    "its present extension suggests that the resonance x(3872 ) is an interesting candidate for the tetraquark @xmath95 .",
    "but the resonance x(3940 ) does not fit so well into this scheme as a @xmath96 state , its mass being 100 mev below the calculated value . for x(3872 ) further work is necessary .",
    "one has to quantitatively estimate the contribution of annihilation channels .",
    "also estimates of the strong decay widths are necessary before any definite conclusion .",
    "besides the chromomagnetic interaction , other effects may be important to the description of tetraquarks , as for example a long - range strong attraction between light quarks , generated by one - meson exchange .",
    "actually this is the basic mechanism of the molecular picture @xcite .",
    "a speculative discussion on an additional effect of the one - meson exchange interaction can be found in ref .",
