    "grbs were first discovered accidentally in the late sixties by the vela satellite @xcite .",
    "the vela satellites detected photons at the 150 - 750 kev range .",
    "this led to several dedicated missions at the sub - mev energy range . indeed",
    "the peak of the energy flux was found to be in this energy range .",
    "for that reason , the main observational and theoretical efforts were made at this range .",
    "egret , the gev detector on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) , was the first to detect grbs at energies above 100mev ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "two particular results of egret were extremely puzzling .",
    "the first , was a detection of an 18 gev photon 1.5 hours after the burst in grb 940217 @xcite .",
    "the second , was the detection of a late time rising gev spectral component in grb 941017 @xcite . for most of the bursts ,",
    "though , there was no high energy ( gev ) detection and only upper limits were obtained @xcite indicating that the gev fluence is at most comparable to the mev fluence @xcite .    at june 2008 ,",
    "nasa launched the fermi gamma - ray space telescope which consists of two instruments .",
    "the lat is a high energy ( 30mev to 300 gev ) detector .",
    "it has a larger energy range , a larger field - of - view ( 2.4sr ) and a shorter dead time ( 26 @xmath1sec ) than its predecessor egret @xcite .",
    "the second instrument on board of fermi , the gbm , covers the lower energy range of 8 kev to 40 mev @xcite , operating as a burst monitor . up to february 2010",
    ", the lat has detected 10 bursts at @xmath2100 mev @xcite while at the same time the gbm detected over 400 bursts @xcite .",
    "the lat detected bursts continue to show those features first seen by egret .",
    "namely , a delayed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and prolonged @xcite gev emission as compared with the sub - mev .",
    "the lat fluence in all the lat detected bursts was lower than , or comparable to , the gbm fluence @xcite .    understanding the properties of",
    "the gev emission is crucial in order to answer two fundamental questions concerning grbs : what is the emitting mechanism of the prompt gamma rays ? and what is the origin of the high energy emission ?",
    "for example , many authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) considered synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) as a mechanism for strong gev emission .",
    "the ratio between the ssc fluence and the synchrotron fluence is of order kev photons to gev is done in the thomson regime by electrons with lorentz factor of @xmath3 . ]",
    "@xmath4 @xcite ( where @xmath5 is the fraction of energy in the electrons and @xmath6 is the fraction of energy in the magnetic field ) , and is therefore expected to be at least of order unity . therefore limits on the gev to mev fluence , put strong limits on the ssc model and the conditions within the emitting region .",
    "ssc was also considered as a plausible radiation mechanism of the sub - mev emissions ( @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that this model is challenged by the lack of gev emission that is brighter than the sub - mev emission .",
    "tighter limits on the gev fluence will rule out this model entirely .",
    "@xcite has discussed the implications of a lack of strong gev emission on the internal shocks model .",
    "he has shown that the model could work if there is a cutoff in the gev due to pair creation and an ssc peak at the far tev range .",
    "an alternative source of the gev emission , motivated by the fact that it is prolonged , is that gev emission arises from a different emitting zone than the prompt emission .",
    "this idea has been explored extensively in such models as the external shock afterglow model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the multi - zone internal shocks model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the low lat detection rate is consistent with a detection rate derived by assuming a ratio of 0.1 between the lat and the gbm fluence and by extrapolating the mev spectrum to the high energy range @xcite .",
    "although @xcite find some grbs that by extrapolating their mev fluence to the gev window should have been detected by lat , but were not . therefore , putting upper limits on the fluence ratio is crucial in order to test the nature of the spectrum at high energies .",
    "this , in turn , will further constrain the emitting mechanism .",
    "for example , in the case of pure synchrotron , we might expect an extrapolation of the sub - mev spectrum , while for ssc we might see a rising spectral slope in the sub - gev .",
    "there has been one example of such a rising spectral slope in the famous grb 090902b @xcite , but the overall picture is still highly uncertain .    in an earlier study , @xcite have used the non - detection of gev emission from the majority of fermi grbs , to put upper limits on the gev fluence of long grbs .",
    "they find an upper limit on the lat / gbm fluence ratio of less than unity for @xmath7 of grbs .",
    "this is consistent but not better than the egret - derived limits @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a more subtle approach to further constrain these limits . as the lat",
    "detected grbs are also among the brightest grbs in the gbm band @xcite , we examine the brightest group of gbm bursts with no lat detection . those are expected to be the bursts with the highest undetected gev fluence .",
    "we obtain upper limits on their gev fluence and use them to gain more stringent upper limits on the lat / gbm fluence ratio . as the lat emission",
    "is extended we obtain limits for both the duration of the prompt mev emission , @xmath0 , and for the extended duration of 600 sec .",
    "these limits rule out ssc as a model for the prompt emission , and put further constraints on many proposed emission mechanisms .",
    "we consider all long ( @xmath0 @xmath8 2 seconds ) grbs detected by gbm by february 2010 .",
    "the gbm has a much wider ( @xmath9sr ) field of view than the lat ( @xmath10sr ) .",
    "after the gbm detects a bright enough grb , according to some selection criteria , fermi slews the lat bore - sight towards the gbm position .",
    "we consider only gbm - detected bursts within the lat field of view . to minimize the effect of slewing ( towards the burst or due to the regular motion of the spacecraft ) we consider only bursts with small bore - sight angles .",
    "it should be stressed that in the following analysis , we do not try to mimic the complicated slewing behaviour of the burst , but rather we develop a method which largely overcomes the difficulties posed by this slewing . as mentioned in  [ sec : int ] , those grbs with a lat detection , are the brightest grbs in the gbm range .",
    "therefore we expect the brightest gbm bursts with no gev detection to be the brightest gev bursts undetected by lat .",
    "these are also the bursts for which we can obtain the tightest limits on the sub - mev to gev fluence ratio .    taking the above considerations into account , our sample of bursts detected only by the gbm ( denoted as the `` gbm sample '' ) includes the 18 most fluent long grbs ( within the lat viewing angle and with a bore - sight angle of less than @xmath11 ) that were detected by the gbm and undetected by lat .",
    "this corresponds to bursts with gbm fluence over @xmath12 erg/@xmath13 .",
    "the seemingly random choice of lower limit on the fluence is taken from the number of bursts we consider .",
    "if we were to find any significant gev signal , it would have made sense to change this limit in accordance and look at additional bursts , but this was not the case .",
    "for all bursts in the sample , we take all the @xmath2100mev photons ( as seen by the lat ) whose positions in the sky are up to @xmath14 from the gbm position . the gbm position error is @xmath15 and can be even less for bright bursts @xcite .",
    "therefore , the source of the lat fluence ( if such a source exists ) is very likely within the data set . from the gbm position only ]",
    "we only take photons with a bore - sight angle of less than @xmath11 as the lat effective area per photon decreases rapidly for viewing angles larger than @xmath11 .",
    "we also consider a sample of lat detected bursts ( denoted the `` lat sample '' ) that consists of the 10 bursts with a reported detection by the lat team during the same period .",
    "a grb is tagged as detected by the lat if the number of photons detected , @xmath16 , exceeds 10 and if it exceeds a @xmath17 fluctuation of the background ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these bursts include : 080916c , 080825c , 090217,090323 , 090328 , 090626 , 090902b , 090926a , 091003a , 091031 .",
    "note that so far the lat team published detailed fluence measurements only for four of those bursts : 080825c , 080916c , 090217 , 090902b @xcite .",
    "our goal is to obtain an upper limit on the gev fluence of each of the bursts in the gbm sample .",
    "a complete approach involves maximizing a general likelihood function , for which the free parameters are : the burst s position , ( x , y ) , the ratio , r , between the burst s fluence and the total ( burst+noise ) fluence , and the spectral parameters of both the burst @xmath18 and the noise @xmath19 .",
    "the likelihood function is : @xmath20\\ , \\ ] ] where the summation is over all photons within @xmath14 of the gbm position from t=0 to t = t ( t can be @xmath0 or 600 sec depending on the assumption on the origin of the gev emission ) .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 are the right ascension and declination of the ith photon in local cartesian coordinates . from the gbm location , we can ( to a very good approximation ) use a locally flat coordinate system .",
    "this is done by taking the projection of each position on the sphere to the plane tangent to the sphere at the gbm position .",
    "these are the x , y coordinates .",
    "] @xmath23 is the probability that a photon with energy @xmath24 from a burst at ( x , y ) will be detected at @xmath25 , namely it is the value of the lat point spread function for photon energy @xmath24 at the angle between ( x , y ) and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this method turns out to depend strongly on the unknown spectrum of the noise @xmath26 , and it can not be used .",
    "we turn to a different approach which is more stable .",
    "we split the process into two phases .",
    "first we find the most probable positions of the bursts using a simpler likelihood procedure .",
    "then , using these positions we calculate fluence upper limits .",
    "we find the most probable position of a burst by maximizing the likelihood , @xmath27 , that it is located at ( x , y ) : @xmath28 fig .",
    "[ fig : like ] depicts an example of this likelihood function for burst 081231 . to calculate the likelihood function",
    "we need the burst s spectrum , @xmath29 .",
    "we assume @xmath30 .",
    "we allow for variation in the slope of the spectrum and find that the dependence of the position on this parameter is weak . a change of the spectral index between -1 to -3 , yields a change in the calculated position of less than @xmath31 . in addition",
    ", we verify in  [ sec : lat ] that the assumption @xmath30 results in good agreement with the positions found by the lat team for lat detected bursts in the sample .",
    "table [ tbl : pos ] describes the positions of the bursts and compares them to the gbm positions .",
    "note that the gbm positions have error bars of @xmath32 and that the most probable position that we calculate may be dominated by the noise .",
    "the errors in our locations are calculated according to the decline of the log - likelihood function @xcite and correspond to 68@xmath33 confidence levels .",
    ".positions of our `` gbm sample '' - 18 brightest gbm bursts in the lat field of view that were not detected by the lat .",
    "the method we use to calculate the most probable lat position is described in the text [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the results for the duration of @xmath0 are summarized in table [ tbl : flu ] . for the gbm bursts we find upper limits with an average fluence of @xmath34 erg/@xmath13 , corresponding to an average upper limit of 0.13 on the lat / gbm fluence ratio .",
    "notice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : latgbmt90 ] ) that these limits are almost uniform for all gbm bursts and do not seem to depend on the gbm fluence of the bursts .",
    "this means that the upper limits derived here are mainly representative of the lat detection limit ( with our method ) and do not show any evidence for actual gev signals in the gbm sample .",
    "the upper limits at 600 sec has an average fluence of @xmath35 erg/@xmath13 , corresponding to an upper limit of 0.45 on the lat / gbm fluence ratio . as for the case of @xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ fig : latgbm600 ] shows almost uniform limits for different gbm fluences .",
    "therefore these limits too , correspond to the lat detection limit within our method .",
    "the fact that the limits here are higher than the @xmath0 limits is merely an artifact of the longer timescales and therefore higher noise level .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ tbl : flu ] .",
    "the overall number of bursts detected by lat is consistent with an extrapolation of the band function fitted at the mev range @xcite to the gev range .",
    "it is interesting to check weather this extrapolation is consistent with the upper limits we obtain in  [ sec : uplim ] .",
    "for all bursts in the sample , we take the band parameters ( and corresponding errors ) @xcite : @xmath36 ( the peak in @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 ( the lower energy spectral slope ) , @xmath39 ( the higher energy spectral slope ) as reported in the gcns .",
    "in addition we also take the bursts @xmath0 and the overall fluence in the gbm band .",
    "we extrapolate the mev emission of gbm bursts using the band function to the lat energy range [ 100 mev - 30 gev ] .",
    "we calculate the overall lat fluence expected for each burst in the sample assuming no break in the spectral index between the gbm and the lat windows . as we do not have the covariance matrices of the spectral fits , and we do nt know the degree of correlation between the various errors , we assume the `` worst case scenario '' .",
    "this is to say we take those correlations that maximize the overall error in the fluence estimate .",
    "specifically , this means that when looking for a lower limit on the extrapolation we take the lower values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the higher value of @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , changing @xmath38 is also not relevant for the sake of these limits .",
    "this is what we refer to as @xmath42 , it is an overestimate of the actual value .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tbl : flu ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrap ] most expected fluences ( 9 out of 16 ) are compatible with the upper limits . in two bursts (",
    "e.g. 081009 , 091120 ) the band extrapolations are a few orders of magnitudes below the upper limits .",
    "this is not necessarily significant as these are only upper limits and the actual lat fluence is unknown and can be low .",
    "the rest ( 5 out of 16 ) , almost a third of the bursts , have band extrapolations significantly above the upper limits on their @xmath0 fluence . in",
    "most of these bursts the band extrapolation is 2 - 3@xmath43 above our lat 90@xmath33 upper limit .",
    "therefore , there is no single burst in which this excess is measured without doubt .",
    "however the fact that such a non - negligible access is observed in a large fraction of the sample is notable , and it suggests an evidence for a decline in the slope of the spectrum at high energies of some bursts .",
    "a similar pattern is observed when we extrapolate mev emission using the band function reported by @xcite for the lat detected bursts .",
    "the comparison of the band extrapolated fluence and our estimates of the actual @xmath0 lat fluence is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : latdett90 ] , where we also present band extrapolations based on fits reported in gcns , that in almost all cases agree with those of @xcite . for the majority of the bursts (",
    "080916c , 090217 , 090626 , 090926a , 091003a , 091031 ) the band extrapolated fluence is of order of the lat estimated fluence .",
    "these bursts are consistent with a single spectral component ranging from mev to gev @xcite . in grb 090902b ,",
    "the extrapolated fluence is three orders of magnitude lower than its estimated fluence , indicating on an additional source of high energy emission @xcite . in the last three bursts ( 080825c , 090323 , 090328 ) the extrapolated fluence to the gev range is about an order of magnitude higher ( @xmath44 ) than the estimated gev fluence .",
    "these cases provide again , evidence for a steepening of the high energy spectral slope between the mev and the gev bands .",
    "note that grb 080825c has a large bore - sight angle and therefore our estimates are less reliable for this burst .",
    "however , the band extrapolation for this burst is also above the fluence reported by the lat team for the entire lat fluence ( not only confined to @xmath0 ) from this grb .    even though the break in the spectrum is not confirmed for any of the bursts individually , we can attempt to estimate the lorentz factors for those grbs where we can see a possible steepening in the high energy spectral slope .",
    "this is done by assuming that the steepening originates from the increase in the optical depth with photon energy until it reaches order unity at the energy where a break is seen in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "we assume that the energy of the break is of the order of 1gev for these bursts",
    "( an increase by a factor of 10 in the break energy , will only change the estimate by a factor @xmath45 ) .",
    "this yields estimated lorentz factors of : @xmath46 for 090323 and @xmath47 for 090328 .",
    "grb 080825c has no known redshift , and therefore we can not directly estimate it s lorentz factor . for a generic z=1",
    "we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "these results are within the  generic range \" expected for the lorentz factor in grbs .",
    "the results rule out any model in which there is a strong gev component in the prompt mission .",
    "in particular they limit strongly ssc models for the prompt emission as those will suggest a second ssc component at the gev ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they pose a strong limit on the conditions within the emitting regions showing no ic gev peak .",
    "gev emission from grbs is as of yet relatively unexplored observationally . up to february 2010",
    ", only 10 bursts were detected by lat in the gev range .",
    "already in this early observational stage , though , there is much information that can be extracted by detailed analysis .",
    "this , in turn , provides us with independent tests to the various emitting mechanisms .",
    "we have analyze the group of bursts expected to have the highest ( undetected ) gev component .",
    "those are the 18 most luminous gbm bursts with no lat detection . for these bursts",
    ", we obtain upper limits on the gev fluence . for the whole sample",
    "we obtain an average upper limit to the fluence ratio of 0.13 during the prompt phase ( @xmath0 ) and an average upper limit to the ratio of 0.45 for 600 sec .",
    "these ratios strongly constrain various emission models and in particular rule out ssc models for either the mev emission or the gev component in the prompt emission . in both cases ,",
    "a significant lat component is expected .",
    "the fluence estimates for lat bursts , lead to somewhat lower ratios for the lat / gbm fluence ratio .",
    "these are @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the durations of @xmath0 and 600 sec respectively ( figs .",
    "[ fig : latdett90]@xmath51 [ fig : latdet600 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the lat bursts show a correlation between their lat and gbm fluences , namely - the stronger a burst is in the gbm band , the stronger it is in the lat band . considering that for the lat undetected bursts there are only upper limits , these results are consistent with the lat - gbm fluence correlation which is seen in the lat - detected bursts .",
    "namely , the lat bursts do nt have to be drawn from a different population than the gbm bursts .    for the majority of the gbm and",
    "the lat bursts the gev fluence is compatible with the band extrapolation of the mev emission .",
    "however , out of the lat bursts , in three cases the band extrapolation of the mev emission is higher than the observed fluence . similarly the band extrapolation is higher than the lat upper limits in 5 out of 16 gbm bursts .",
    "both results are consistent and suggest that in some bursts we observe a decline in the spectral high energy slope between the mev and the gev .",
    "this may be the first indication for the long sought after pair opacity break in the high energy spectrum . if so it can enable us to estimate corresponding values of the bulk lorentz factors which are around a few hundred .",

    "<S> the large area telescope ( lat ) on board of the fermi satellite detected emission above 20 mev only in a small fraction of the long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected by the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) at 8 kev - 40 mev . </S>",
    "<S> those bursts that were detected by the lat were among the brightest gbm bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we examine a sample of the most luminous gbm bursts with no lat detection and obtain upper limits on their high energy fluence . </S>",
    "<S> we find an average upper limit of lat / gbm fluence ratio of 0.13 for gev fluence during @xmath0 and an average upper limit ratio of 0.45 for gev fluence during the first 600 seconds after the trigger . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios strongly constrain various emission models and in particular rule out ssc models for the prompt emission . in about a third of both lat detected and lat non - detected bursts , we find that the extrapolation of the mev range band spectrum to the gev range is larger than the observed gev fluence ( or its upper limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> while this excess is not highly significant for any specific burst , the overall excess in a large fraction of the bursts suggests a decline in the high energy spectral slope in at least some of these bursts . </S>",
    "<S> possibly an evidence for the long sought after pair creation limit .    </S>",
