    "inflation is the most promising paradigm for understanding the initial conditions for cosmic structure formation and the pattern of anisotropies in temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "its predictions for the simplest case of a single scalar field model with a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of curvature and tensor perturbations are in good agreement with most of the observational data",
    ".    among observations , data on cmb anisotropies have been the most selective for inflation , starting from cobe - dmr @xcite to the nasa mission presently in operation wmap @xcite .",
    "the wmap first - year data @xcite complemented with smaller scale data started to discriminate among the inflationary models and to constrain the possibility that the spectra may have not a pure power - law shape @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare inflationary predictions with wmap three year data release @xcite plus smaller scale cmb data ( which we shall denote collectively as cmbsmall ) , such as cbi @xcite , acbar @xcite , vsa @xcite and b2k @xcite .",
    "we shall also use separately two lss data sets , sdss @xcite and 2df @xcite .",
    "we compare inflationary predictions with observations , by adopting a parametrization of the primordial power spectra ( ps henceforth ) of curvature and tensor perturbations as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for scalar and tensor , respectively , @xmath7 is the pivot scale .",
    "we shall use @xmath8 in terms of of the hubble parameter @xmath9 and the _ horizon flow functions _ @xmath10 ( hff henceforth ) evaluated at the pivot scale @xmath7 . at the present state of the art , the ps of primordial perturbations in most of the single field inflationary models depend only on the physics at the hubble crossing since adiabaticity on large scale is preserved .",
    "the hffs are defined as @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the number fo e - folds ( @xmath15 ) @xcite . for a klein - gordon scalar field @xmath16 , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are related to the potential and its derivatives as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 gev is the reduced planck mass . by comparing constraints on @xmath19 derived by observations ,",
    "the shape of the inflationary potential can be constrained through eqs .",
    "( [ potential_eps ] ) .",
    "we use the most advanced analytic descriptions of inflationary spectra which relate @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "these expressions are obtained by the green s function method ( henceforth gfm ) @xcite and by the method of comparison equations ( henceforth mce ) @xcite .",
    "these two methods provide a description of cosmological perturbations spectra up to second order in the hff , allowing a good accuracy also in inflationary models where the hff are not so small or constant in time , i.e. the slow - roll condition is not well satisfied @xcite . note that the gfm and mce methods predict the same pss at @xmath22 , but differences of percent order arise in the coefficients of @xmath23 terms @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address several points of current interest in comparing inflationary preditions with observations . at first order in hffs",
    "we update the analysis of leach and liddle @xcite to wmap3 @xcite and to 2df05 @xcite . at second order in hffs ,",
    "we first show how the large running found by the wmap team @xcite is recovered by using the ps parametrization in terms of the hffs .",
    "we also give a model - independent constraint on the tensor amplitude by considering the tensor - to - scalar ratio as a free parameter and not given in terms of the tensor spectral index .",
    "we then study the constraints on inflationary models which violate the null energy condition ( nec ) and predict a blue spectrum for gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our methodology and in section iii the constraints on cosmological parameters by restricting the parametrization for the spectra at first order in hffs for standard inflationary models . in section",
    "iii we relax the assumption that the inflaton is a klein - gordon ( kg henceforth ) scalar field and we leave the tensor - to - scalar ratio as a free parameter . in section",
    "iv we compare the constraints on inflationary models with a blue spectrum for gravitational waves with standard inflationary models . in section v we present the results obtained allowing running(s ) of the spectral indices in standard inflationary models , i.e. taking into account spectra to second order in hffs . in section",
    "vi we conclude .",
    "we use the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package @xcite which makes use of the einstein - botzmann code camb @xcite for the computation of theoretical cmb anisotropies pss and transfer functions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to flat spatial sections and to three species of massless neutrinos .",
    "we use as initial conditions for cosmological fluctuations the growing adiabatic mode .",
    "we include the cmbsmall data set as by default implemented in cosmomc .",
    "note that small scale data by the same experiments have been used by the wmap team in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] , although there may be additional cross - correlations between the data sets which we consider and wmap3 data .",
    "we restrict our analysis to linear transfer functions and therefore the lss data are automatically truncated by the mcmc to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) for 2df ( sdss ) .",
    "the convergence diagnostic on runs with multiple chains is the r statistic by gelman and rubin implemented in the mcmc .",
    "we use the @xmath26 expansion of the logarithm of the parametrizations in eqs .",
    "( [ i_spectra ] ) , in order to avoid that the spectrum becomes negative for some values of the inflationary parameters explored by mcmc @xcite .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ i_spectra ] ) , the @xmath26 expansion of the power spectra is : @xmath27 and we use both the gfm @xcite and mce @xcite to relate the coefficients @xmath28s to the hffs .",
    "the coefficients for the scalar spectrum are : @xmath29 and for tensors are : @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the euler - mascheroni constant ) and @xmath33 . at second order",
    "the next - to - leading coefficients depend on the method of approximation used to study cosmological perturbations during inflation : @xmath34 and @xmath35 are obtained within the gfm @xcite ; @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , within the mce @xcite .",
    "we therefore implement the above expansion in a modified version of the inflationary routines developed by samuel leach and public at http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/@xmath39sleach/inflation/camb_inflation.html .",
    "as pivot scale we choose @xmath40 as in @xcite ( see however @xcite ) ; this choice differs from those by the wmap team ( @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 @xcite ) and is better placed at the center of the range of wavenumbers probed by cosmological perturbations studied in the linear regime .",
    "although the cmb spectrum includes at least a convolution of the power - spectrm with spherical bessel functions , an effective pivot @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath7 can be defined @xcite : k_*= _ * 10 ^ 3 mpc^-1 .",
    "since @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath40 does not represent an interesting reference scale to measure the tensor - to - scalar ratio , we shall also quote in our results both @xmath45 and the ratio of tensor to scalar contribution to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , denoted by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .    as parameter describing reionization",
    "we shall vary the redshift @xmath50 , which is related to the optical depth @xmath51 by an integration over the redshift @xmath52 @xcite = _ t _ 0^z_re d z , with @xmath53 as the thompson cross section and @xmath54 is the electron density number . as for the tensor - to - scalar ratios @xmath55 and @xmath48",
    ", we also give the constraints on @xmath51 as a derived parameter .",
    "in this section we explore the constraints for a model in which the inflaton is described by a klein - gordon scalar field and the spectra in eqs .",
    "( [ plex ] ) are taken to first order in hffs ( i.e. @xmath56 ) .",
    "when the inflaton is described by a klein - gordon scalar field the tensor - to - scalar ratio is not a free parameter , but is given by the so - called consistency condition which is : = 16 _ 1 .",
    "[ ttos ] in this case we vary @xmath57 free parameters : \\{_b h^2 , _ cdm h^2 , h_0 , 10 ^ 10 a_s , z_re , _ 1,_2 } , [ string ] where @xmath58 are baryon and cold dark matter densities , @xmath59 is the present hubble parameter , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the amplitude of super - hubble curvature perturbation deep in the radiation era , @xmath62 are the first two hffs .",
    "the prior on these parameters are : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 as in @xcite , @xmath67 ; @xmath68    the one dimensional posterior marginalized probability distributions obtained from a markov chain of ( at least ) @xmath69 elements ( which uses the covariance matrix of a preliminary chain ) for sampled and derived parameters are shown in fig .",
    "1,2 and in table 1 .",
    "we compare the results obtained by using the first year and the three years of wmap data ( plus cmbsmall and 2df02 @xcite ) , as well as the results of the three years of wmap data and cmbsmall with different lss data sets ( 2df02 @xcite , sdss @xcite and 2df05 @xcite ) .",
    "different estimates of cosmological parameters obtained with different lss data sets are very known ( see table 6 of @xcite ) and may be due to different selection of the sdss and 2df surveys : this is the reason why we do not combine different lss data sets .",
    "one of the main results of wmap3 , i.e. a better estimate ( and different from wmap1 ) of reionization , has changed the value of the scalar spectral index @xmath70 . by combining with cmbsmall plus 2df02 ,",
    "wmap3 fully marginalized @xmath4 value is @xmath71 ( compared to the wmap1 correspondent value @xmath72 ) . as is clear from the right panel of figs",
    "3,4 , without marginalizing on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , a pure harrison - zeldovich spectrum for scalar perturbations with no tensors ( @xmath73 ) is disfavoured at more than @xmath4 by the combination of cmb data with 2df02 or sdss , but is within @xmath4 for cmb data plus 2df05 .",
    "another interesting result we find is that inflationary models predicting @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) _ and _ tensors are also disfavoured at @xmath4 by the same data sets for which the hz spectrum is disfavoured with the same cl ( again , this is not true for cmb data plus 2df05 ) . as shown by fig .",
    "4 , this effect is due to the inclusion of small scale cmb datasets @xcite .",
    "note from fig . 4",
    "how our results on wmap3 + sdss agree with previous analysis with the same data sets @xcite . by comparing our results to fig . 1 of @xcite where wmap1 results were reported , we see that models with a natural exit from inflation ( the region @xmath76 ) are now preferred by wmap3 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     at @xmath77 we obtain the fully marginalized value of the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for wmap3+cmbsmall+2df05 ( sdss ) .",
    "the @xmath4 constraint is @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) for wmap3+cmbsmall+2df05 ( sdss ) .",
    "we note that the best - fit cosmological models obtained by 2df05 and sdss are different , enlarging the difference between the two lss data sets already seen in section iii : sdss prefers a very low value for @xmath59 ( as also reported in @xcite ) and the best - fit cosmological model with running is consistent with the one without running only at @xmath4 .",
    "the cosmological models with and without running for 2df05 are consistent at @xmath77 : allowing running for the spectral indexes the constraint on @xmath82 for 2df05 is significantly related to @xmath83 at @xmath4 cl .",
    "since @xmath84 enters only in the scalar running , the magnitude of the running of the tensor spectral index is constrained at posteriori to be @xmath85 , as is also clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : bt2 ] ) and from fig .",
    "( [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "although our combination of data sets and our method of constraining inflationary parameters differ from those used by the wmap team @xcite , our results are in agreement with those reported in @xcite for wmap3 plus other small scale cmb data sets .",
    "we have analyzed the observational constraints from cmb and lss on the inflationary expansion . by parametrizing the inflationary spectra as power - law ( i.e. to first order in slow - roll parameters ) ,",
    "we have updated the wmap1 constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite : the better determination of reionization obtained by the 3 year data release disfavour now both the harrizon - zeldovich model ( with no tensor ) as inflationary models predicting @xmath86 with respect to the first year data .",
    "our analysis shows that models with a natural exit from inflation ( which stay in the @xmath76 region of the @xmath87 plane according to @xcite ) are now favoured by wmap3 .",
    "when running is included , we have shown how the prior on @xmath3 plays a crucial role in re - obtaining the wmap team results within an analysis employing analytic power - spectra depending on ( @xmath88 ) with @xmath89 . only allowing a broad prior on @xmath3 a fairly large negative running in agreement with the wmap results is obtained .",
    "we have found that is more convenient to use @xmath90 rather than @xmath3 .",
    "the value for the running @xmath91 found here implies @xmath92 for fourier modes far from the pivot scale",
    ". it would be therefore interesting to perform a comparison of data with inflationary predictions at third order in the hff .",
    "note that the value of the running found here is different from zero at @xmath93 level , and its constraints may also be affected by ly@xmath94 data @xcite , which we do not consider here .",
    "we have also studied the impact of theoretical priors on constraining the inflationary expansion : still little is known about high - energy physics and prejudices in interpreting cosmological data may hide interesting physics .",
    "we have first relaxed the hypothesis of a canonical scalar field as the inflaton , which leads to the consistency relation in eq .",
    "( [ ttos ] ) . by considering a generic lagrangian ,",
    "the constraints on the @xmath95 plane degrade significantly , while the limits on @xmath55 depend on the slope of the tensor spectrum .",
    "this analysis shows that a kg inflaton ( with sound speed @xmath96 ) is well inside the confidence contours of the present constraints , although the present data do not allow to constrain @xmath97 .",
    "we have then explored how cmb and lss constrain inflationary models with a blue spectrum , a more radical departure than considering @xmath55 as a free parameter .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to kg field with the `` wrong '' sign for the kinetic term , in order to do not consider the tensor - to - scalar ratio as an independent parameter .",
    "we find that both standard inflation and nec violating inflation are equally good fits to the data ( the best fits for these two classes of models have the same @xmath98 comparing with wmap3+cmbsmall+2df02 ) .",
    "for @xmath99 , the constrained region on the @xmath95 are different from the standard case , leading to @xmath100 with @xmath101 at 2@xmath2 cl .",
    "a simple exponential potential potential is disfavoured at 2 @xmath2 cl and larger values for @xmath55 are allowed with respect to the standard case with @xmath102 .",
