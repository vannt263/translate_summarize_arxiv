    "in a number of forcefully - written papers some twenty years ago , band and park @xcite strongly recommended that the basic objective of quantum statistical thermodynamics should be taken to be the estimation of a gibbs distribution ( satisfying imposed constraints on expectation values of observables ) over the continuum or `` logical spectrum '' of possible density matrices describing the system in question .",
    "this was viewed as a conceptually preferable alternative to that of estimating such a distribution over simply a set of eigenstates  corresponding to a _ single _",
    "canonical density matrix  as in the standard jaynesian approach @xcite .",
    "they , however , encountered `` two barriers '' in attempting to establish that their suggested methodology would yield identically the same expectation values as the empirically successful jaynesian strategy .",
    "`` one is essentially philosophical : the prior distribution needed in this continuum problem because of the inadequacy of the laplacian rule of indifference , remains unknown .",
    "the other obstacle is mathematical : @xmath1 we could not perform the required integrals because we have no useful analytical description of the domain [ of density matrices ] and its boundary '' @xcite .",
    "more recently , park @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in studying schrdinger s probability relations , wrote that the `` details of quantum thermodynamics are presently unknown '' and `` perhaps there is more to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium than can be captured in the canonical density operator itself . ''    the first and principal model considered here ( sec  [ sc ] ) is a particular implementation for the case of two - level ( standard complex ) quantum systems of the general program ( formulated in terms of systems of _ arbitrary _ dimensionality ) of band and park ( cf .",
    "it yields seemingly novel analyses of both the thermodynamic properties of a plane radiation field @xcite and of paramagnetic phenomena ( cf .",
    "a noteworthy aspect of our analyses is that we find it necessary to identify the parameter @xmath2 of the gibbs distributions introduced below , not with the inverse thermodynamic temperature , as is conventional , but rather with the _ effective polarization _ temperature @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , we find a _ negative _ log - linear relationship ( equation ( [ xbetalog ] ) and fig .",
    "[ plot6 ] ) between this temperature and the reduced thermodynamic temperature of the standard model of paramagnetism .    the usual textbook treatment of the particular ( spin-1/2 ) case of paramagnetism in which an ensemble of @xmath3 noninteracting _",
    "two_-level systems is subjected to a magnetic field @xmath4 predicts that the equilibrium magnetization ( @xmath5 ) is given by the corresponding ( hyperbolic tangent ) brillouin function , @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath8 is the bohr magneton , @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath10 is temperature .",
    "brillouin ( generalized langevin ) functions , in general , it appears , yield good predictions except for low temperatures and high fields @xcite . in volume",
    "i of his text , balian @xcite writes that the hyperbolic tangent brillouin `` model gives a qualitative understanding of the saturation effect",
    "... however , the quantitative agreement is not good as the behaviour predicted ... altogether does not have the same shape as the experimental curves '' ( cf .",
    "* fig . 6.5 ) ) .",
    "lavenda @xcite has recently argued that the hyperbolic tangent `` brillouin function has to coincide with the first moment of the distribution [ for a two - level system having probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and this means that the generating function is @xmath13 [ where @xmath14 .",
    "now , it will be appreciated that this function can not be written as a definite integral , such as @xmath15 because the integral form for the hyperbolic bessel function , @xmath16 exists only for @xmath17 .",
    "this means that @xmath18 can not be expressed in the above integral form .",
    "since the generating function can not be derived as the laplace transform of a prior probability density , it casts serious doubts on the probabilistic foundations of the brillouin function . in other words ,",
    "any putative expression for the generating function must be compatible with the underlying probabilistic structure ; that is , it must be able to be represented as the laplace transform of a prior probability density . ''    additionally , as the concluding paragraph of his recent book , lavenda writes @xcite , `` even in this simple case of the langevin function , @xmath19 we have witnessed a transition from a statistics dictated by the central - limit theorem , at weak - fields , to one governed by extreme - value distributions , at strong - fields .",
    "such richness is not possessed by the brillouin function , for although it is almost identical to the langevin function in the weak - field limit , the brillouin function becomes independent of the field in the strong - field limit . in the latter limit",
    ", it would imply complete saturation which does not lead to any probability distribution .",
    "this is yet another inadequacy of modeling ferromagnetism by a brillouin function , in the mean field approximation . and",
    "it is another illustration of our recurring theme that * physical phenomena are always connected to probability distributions*. if the latter does [ _ sic _ ] not exist , the former is [ _ sic _ ] almost sure to be illusory . ''",
    "we derive here standard complex , quaternionic , real and classical / nonquantum counterparts  ( [ expo ] ) , ( [ quatpolar ] ) , ( [ realexp ] ) and ( [ polkmb ] )  to the hyperbolic tangent brillouin function ( [ brill ] ) , which are , evidently , not subject to the objections to it that lavenda has raised . the question of whether or not they are superior in explaining physical phenomena , warrants further investigation .",
    "we consider the two - level quantum systems , describable ( in the standard complex case ) by @xmath0 density matrices of the form , @xmath20 we assign to such a system an energy @xmath21 equal ( in appropriate units ) to the negative of the logarithm of the determinant of @xmath22 , that is ( transforming to spherical coordinates  @xmath23  so that @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( cf .",

    "concerned with systems of arbitrary dimensionality ( not simply two - dimensional systems , as here ) , band and park did conclude @xcite that for the case of `` strong '' or dynamical equilibrium , an axiom of `` data indifference '' was preferable to one of `` state indifference '' .    in conclusion ,",

    "of particular novelty has been the identification of the parameter @xmath2 of the gibbs canonical distributions introduced above with the effective polarization temperature , and not , as is conventional , the inverse thermodynamic temperature .",
