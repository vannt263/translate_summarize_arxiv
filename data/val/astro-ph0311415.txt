    "binary radio pulsars provide a rich laboratory for a wide range of physical inquiry , including neutron star masses and the evolution of binary systems .",
    "the pulsars with the best - determined masses all have eccentric relativistic orbits , spin periods of tens of milliseconds , and masses clustered very tightly around 1.35m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is generally thought that millisecond pulsars ( @xmath6ms ) should have greater mass than these longer - period pulsars due to a larger accreted mass .",
    "there is indeed a statistical suggestion that this is the case , but to date no precise millisecond pulsar mass measurements exist .",
    "the best - determined millisecond pulsar masses are @xmath7 for psr  b1855 + 09 @xcite and @xmath8 for psr  j0437@xmath04715 @xcite .",
    "psr  j1909@xmath03744  was discovered during the swinburne high latitude pulsar survey , a recently - completed pulsar search using the 13-beam multibeam receiver on the 64-m parkes radio telescope ( jacoby 2003 ; jacoby et al . in preparation ) .",
    "this survey is similar to , and an extension of , the highly - successful swinburne intermediate latitude pulsar survey @xcite .",
    "the pulsar was discovered in three adjacent survey beams observed on 2001 january 25 and confirmed on 2001 may 26 . due to the pulsar s strong broad - band scintillation , the initial position inferred from the discovery data was in error by nearly a full beamwidth ; it was not until we obtained a phase - connected timing solution that we realized the correct position .    among the properties that can make a pulsar useful for precision timing experiments",
    "are a bright , narrow pulse profile , extremely stable rotation , proximity to the earth , and a companion star which can be detected and studied .",
    "psr  j1909@xmath03744  appears to possess all of these desirable traits .",
    "nearly all of the pulsar s flux comes in a single narrow , sharp peak with full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of only 43@xmath1s , less than 1.5% of the 2.95ms pulse period ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1909_profile ] ) .",
    "the brightness of the pulsar varies by at least a factor of 30 in the 21-cm band .",
    "the mean flux density of our observations is 3mjy , but this is biased by the fact that we tend to observe longer when the pulsar is bright .",
    "extremely high precision timing observations are possible during episodes of favorable scintillation .",
    "following the confirmation of psr  j1909@xmath03744 , we began timing observations with the @xmath9mhz parkes filterbank centered on 1390mhz .",
    "as a result of our incorrect discovery position , few observations taken before february 2002 yielded data useful for high - precision timing .",
    "integration times ranged from three to 100 minutes , with the longer observations broken into 10-minute sub - integrations .",
    "we followed standard pulsar timing procedures : folded pulse profiles from individual observations were cross - correlated with a high signal - to - noise template profile to determine an average pulse time of arrival ( toa ) , corrected to utc(nist ) .",
    "the standard pulsar timing package tempo , along with the jet propulsion laboratory s de405 ephemeris , was used for all timing analysis . all 1.4ghz toas with uncertainty less than 1@xmath1s",
    "were included .",
    "toa uncertainties were multiplied by 1.25 to achieve reduced @xmath10 .",
    "several observations were also obtained in the 50-cm band with the @xmath11mhz parkes filterbank centered on 660mhz . as these observations did not yield toa uncertainties less than 1@xmath1s they were used only to determine the dispersion measure ( @xmath12 ) , which was then held fixed .",
    "because of the system s low eccentricity ( @xmath13 ) , we used the ell1 binary model which replaces the familiar longitude of periastron ( @xmath14 ) , time of periastron ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath13 with the time of ascending node ( @xmath16 ) and the laplace - lagrange parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we give the results of our timing analysis in table  [ tab : par ] and show residuals relative to this best - fit model in figure  [ fig:1909_residuals ] .",
    "the weighted rms residual is only 330ns , among the best obtained for any pulsar over @xmath192 year timespans .",
    "we have begun regular observations of psr  j1909@xmath03744  with the caltech - parkes - swinburne recorder ii ( cpsr2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "cpsr2 is a baseband recorder and real - time coherent dedispersion system with two dual - polarization bands , each 64mhz wide .",
    "the cpsr2 pulse profile shown in figure  [ fig:1909_profile ] is smeared by only 2@xmath1s , compared with the 82@xmath1s time resolution of the 512-channel filterbank .",
    "initial results from cpsr2 data show great promise for high precision timing , and will be reported in a future paper .",
    "though our current data set suffers from poor orbital phase coverage ( specifically a lack of high - quality observations near inferior conjunction ) , we find strong evidence of shapiro delay .",
    "if we remove shapiro delay ( i.e. companion mass , @xmath20 , and sine of orbital inclination , @xmath21 ) from the timing model and allow tempo to optimize the remaining parameters , @xmath22 increases from 98.8 to 128.1 ( for 102 and 104 degrees of freedom respectively ) , indicating a highly significant detection .",
    "the peak - to - peak residual is essentially the same in either case ( 3.4@xmath1s ) as much of the shapiro delay signal is absorbed into an erroneously large roemer delay ; however , the weighted rms residual increases to 370ns when the model excludes @xmath20 and @xmath21 . holding the astrometric , orbital , and spin parameters fixed at the values in table  [ tab : par ] but neglecting shapiro delay increases the peak - to - peak residual to 8.1@xmath1s , with pulses observed nearest inferior conjunction arriving later than predicted by the model .    given its large uncertainty , we are not concerned by the most likely value of @xmath23 found by tempo s linear least - squares fit . to confirm that the shapiro delay is physically meaningful",
    ", we constructed a @xmath22 map as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while optimizing the remaining parameters .",
    "our sparse data set is consistent with a large range of allowed parameter space , constraining the system to have @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "the covariance of the poorly - determined @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the projected semimajor axis ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath13 means that the uncertainties in these parameters given in table  [ tab : par ] are likely to be underestimated .    currently , the strongest constraint on the companion mass is the minimum mass of 0.195m@xmath5 obtained from the mass function by assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28m@xmath5 ; the fact that shapiro delay is detected at all suggests that we are likely viewing the system roughly edge - on .",
    "future pulsar timing observations near inferior conjunction will significantly improve the shapiro delay - derived companion mass .",
    "we have measured the parallax , @xmath29mas , and hence can estimate the distance to psr  j1909@xmath03744 , @xmath30kpc .",
    "combined with the proper motion , this distance corresponds to a transverse velocity of @xmath3kms@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath12-derived distance estimate is 0.46kpc @xcite .    the pulsar s proper motion induces an apparent radial acceleration equal to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this secular acceleration will allow an entirely independent distance estimate from precise measurement of the orbital period derivative , @xmath32 @xcite . for circular binaries such as psr  j1909@xmath03744 , the intrinsic @xmath32 due to general relativity is negligible .",
    "however , the secular acceleration will eventually produce a measurable @xmath32 which can be used to determine the distance .",
    "the peak - to - peak timing signal due to parallax is @xmath33s , while the @xmath32 signal increases with the observing baseline , @xmath34 , as @xmath35 .",
    "thus , after only a few years of timing @xmath32 will give the more precise distance .",
    "we note that the acceleration induced by differential galactic rotation is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the secular acceleration .",
    "the secular acceleration also corrupts the observed period derivative ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "since the pulsar s intrinsic spindown rate ( @xmath37 ) is non - negative , we can obtain an upper distance limit of 1.4kpc , consistent with the measured parallax .",
    "conversely , the measured proper motion and parallax - derived distance allow us to correct @xmath36 for the secular acceleration and hence determine @xmath37 .",
    "at the position of the pulsar , the digitized sky survey plates showed a possible counterpart . to verify this",
    ", we obtained images on the night of 2003 june 4 with the magellan instant camera ( magic ) at the 6.5-m clay telescope on las campanas .",
    "we took a 10-min exposure in @xmath38 and a 5-min exposure in @xmath39 .",
    "the conditions were poor , with thin clouds and @xmath40 seeing .",
    "the images were reduced using the munich image data analysis system ( midas ) , following the usual steps of bias subtraction ( separately for the four amplifiers ) and flat - fielding using dome flats . for the astrometric calibration , we selected 58 usno - b1.0 @xcite objects that overlapped with our images , were not overexposed , and appeared stellar . for these objects",
    ", we measured centroids and fitted for zero - point position , plate scale , and position angle . rejecting 23 outliers with residuals larger than @xmath41 , the inferred single - star measurement error in both bands is @xmath42 in each coordinate , which is consistent with expectations for the usno - b1.0 measurements . hence our astrometry",
    "should be tied to the usno - b1.0 system at the @xmath43 level .    in both images , we found an object near the position of the pulsar which is blue relative to other stars in the field ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "the position inferred from our astrometry is @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which is consistent with the timing position listed in table  [ tab : par ] within the uncertainty with which the usno - b1.0 system is tied to the international celestial reference frame ( @xmath46 in each coordinate ) .",
    "the identification of this object with the pulsar s companion was confirmed by spectra , taken on the night of 2003 june 6 , using the low dispersion survey spectrograph  2 ( ldss2 ) at the clay telescope .",
    "we took two 30-min exposures with the high resolution grism and a @xmath40 slit , which gives a resolution of @xmath47 .",
    "the conditions were mediocre , with thin cirrus and @xmath48 seeing .",
    "we used midas to reduce the spectra .",
    "they were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using normalized dome flats ( in which the noisy blue part was set to unity ) .",
    "after sky subtraction , the two spectra were extracted using optimal weighting , and added together . to derive the response",
    ", we used spectra of feige  110 , taken during the same night , and fluxes from calibrated stis spectra . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we stress that since cirrus was present , the absolute flux calibration is not reliable , although both from the spectrum and from a rough photometric calibration using usno - b1.0 magnitudes , it follows that the companion has @xmath49 .    the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) shows only the balmer lines of hydrogen , from h@xmath50 up to h10 , consistent with a da white dwarf of low surface gravity ( and thus low mass ) .",
    "the strength of the lines and the slope of the spectrum are similar to what is seen for psr j1012 + 5307 @xcite and psr j0218 + 4232 @xcite , indicating a similar temperature of @xmath51k .    assuming a mass of @xmath52",
    ", the white dwarf should have a radius of approximately @xmath53 and a luminosity of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitude is @xmath55 , which implies @xmath56 at a distance of 0.8kpc , consistent with the rough photometry quoted above .",
    "pulse timing precision is often limited by systematic errors that distort the shape of pulsar profiles due to the interstellar medium and imperfect polarimetric and instrumental response .",
    "intrinsically narrow pulses are less susceptible to these errors , as are pulsars with small dispersion measures .",
    "psr  j1909@xmath03744  is likely to become a cornerstone of future timing array experiments to detect low - frequency gravitational waves .",
    "it is noteworthy that psr  j1909@xmath03744  is far from other high - precision pulsars on the sky and therefore probes a unique line of sight .    in the shorter run ,",
    "further timing of the pulsar , especially with cpsr2 , should yield an accurate inclination and a reasonably precise companion mass .",
    "furthermore , in a modest spectroscopic observing campaign on an 8-m class telescope , the radial velocity orbit of the companion can be measured precisely .",
    "these combined results should allow a very reliable pulsar mass measurement , and advance our understanding of binary pulsar evolution and recycling .",
