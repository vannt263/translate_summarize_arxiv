    "cosmic ray particles span a remarkable range of energies , from the mev scale to more than @xmath8ev ( ev = electron volt ) . at energies above @xmath9tev ( @xmath10ev ) , we know that cosmic rays do not originate from local sources in or nearby our solar system .",
    "therefore , high energy cosmic rays must come from acceleration sites in the galaxy at large or from outside the galaxy .",
    "remarkably , after many years of research , the exact sites of high energy cosmic ray acceleration remain unknown .",
    "there are several difficulties that plague efforts to pinpoint the origins of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "first , since the bulk of the cosmic radiation is electrically charged , any source information contained in the directions of the arriving particles is lost due to deflection in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "a second difficulty concerns the energetics of the proposed cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms .",
    "for example , although models based on shock acceleration in supernova remnants offer plausible explanations for the cosmic ray origin up to @xmath11ev ( and perhaps up to @xmath12ev ) , these models become less satisfying and less realistic at energies above @xmath12ev .",
    "since cosmic ray origins remain mysterious , it is natural to search for neutral radiation from point sources which , if seen , could pinpoint possible acceleration sites .",
    "the question of cosmic ray origin is thus a prime motivation for high energy neutral particle ( gamma - ray or neutrino ) astronomy .",
    "in addition to supernova remnants , possible galactic sources of high energy particles include pulsars and compact binary systems .",
    "gamma - radiation has been unambiguously detected from the crab nebula ( a supernova remnant ) at energies up to @xmath13tev by ground - based detectors @xcite , but , historically , the compact binary sources cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 have received considerably greater attention in the ground - based astronomical community . in the period 1975 - 1990 , literally dozens of gamma - ray detections from cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 were reported by numerous experiments .",
    "the detections spanned a wide range of energies ( @xmath14mev to @xmath15ev ) @xcite , were generally of low statistical significance ( typically three to four standard deviations ) , and episodic in nature .",
    "often a statistically significant signal could only be extracted as a result of a periodicity analysis , where the data were phase - locked to a known source x - ray periodicity . in spite of these difficulties , the sheer number of reports made it difficult to dismiss the detections as being entirely due to statistical fluctuation @xcite .",
    "in fact , by the late 1980 s , it was generally established that cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 were powerful emitters of high energy gamma - rays ( although contrary interpretations of the data existed @xcite ) . a number of new , more sensitive ground - based air shower arrays were commissioned at this time , including the casa - mia experiment in dugway , utah ( usa ) .",
    "this paper describes long - term ( 1990 - 1995 ) observations of cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 by casa - mia .    in the following section , we outline the experimental techniques of gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "we summarize the properties of cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 , and review previous observations of these sources and the astrophysical ramifications from the observations .",
    "we then turn our attention to the experimental apparatus , the event reconstruction procedures , and the methods used to select gamma - ray candidate events .",
    "we present results from a data sample of @xmath0 events , and conclude with comparisons of our results to those of earlier and contemporaneous experiments .",
    "gamma - ray sources typically exhibit power law spectra ; fluxes fall rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "space - borne experiments ( on satellites or balloons ) currently have sufficient sensitivity to detect gamma - rays up to an energy of @xmath16gev .",
    "astronomy at higher energies requires very large collection areas available only to ground - based telescopes .",
    "ground - based instruments rely upon the fact that high energy gamma - rays interact in the earth s atmosphere to produce extensive air showers . at energies near @xmath9tev , atmospheric cherenkov telescopes use optical techniques to detect the cherenkov radiation in the shower . at higher energies ( @xmath16tev and above ) ,",
    "the charged particles in the shower penetrate to ground level . here , air shower arrays record the arrival times and particle densities of the charged particles . at energies above @xmath15ev ,",
    "there is enough energy in the shower to allow the detection of nitrogen fluorescence in the atmosphere .",
    "the faint near ultraviolet fluorescence signal can be optically detected at night by experiments such as the fly s eye .",
    "cygnus x-3 is one of the most luminous x - ray sources in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is characterized by a @xmath7hr periodicity , which is assumed to be associated with the orbital motion of a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) around its binary companion .",
    "the periodicity has been well studied ; a complete ephemeris is available for the period from 1970 - 1995 @xcite .",
    "in addition to being a powerful x - ray source , cygnus x-3 is seen in the infrared and is a strong and variable radio source .",
    "radio flares have been detected in which the output from the source increases by two to three orders of magnitude on the time scale of days @xcite .",
    "these flares were first detected in 1972 and the outbursts have continued through 1994 .",
    "since cygnus x-3 lies in the galactic plane , its optical emission is largely obscured by interstellar material .",
    "the lack of a strong optical signal makes determination of the distance to cygnus x-3 difficult , but general consensus places it near @xmath13kpc @xcite .    the first published result claiming the detection of gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3 came in 1977 from the sas-2 satellite at low gamma - ray energies ( e@xmath17mev ) @xcite .",
    "this result made use of an apparent correlation between the gamma - ray arrival times and the @xmath7hr x - ray periodicity .",
    "later observations by the cos - b satellite @xcite with a much larger source exposure failed to confirm the sas-2 result , and the cos - b authors argued that the initial detection @xcite was flawed because of an incorrect treatment of the diffuse gamma - ray component @xcite . to complicate matters ,",
    "there have been re - examinations of both the sas-2 @xcite and cos - b @xcite data sets which claim that signals indeed exist in both cases .",
    "most recently , the egret experiment on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) failed to detect gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3 at a sensitivity level comparable to cos - b @xcite .",
    "to summarize , there exists some controversy as to whether low energy gamma - rays have _ ever _ been detected from cygnus x-3 .",
    "regardless , it can be reasonably concluded that the source is not a strong emitter of gamma - rays in the energy range between @xmath18mev and @xmath13gev",
    ".    the first published report of very - high energy gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3 came from the crimean observatory using an atmospheric cherenkov telescope at energies above @xmath19tev @xcite .",
    "this result was based on data taken between 1972 and 1977 and the emission was claimed to be correlated with the @xmath7hr x - ray period . from 1980 to 1990 , there were numerous additional detections of cygnus x-3 by atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the detections were generally episodic in nature and usually required the use of the @xmath7hr periodicity to extract a signal .",
    "evidence for a 12.6 msec gamma - ray pulsar inside the cygnus x-3 system was claimed on more than one occasion @xcite .    at the higher energies accessible by ground arrays , evidence for ultra - high energy gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3",
    "was presented by the kiel array @xcite and subsequently by the haverah park experiment @xcite .",
    "these results were based on data taken between 1976 and 1980 .",
    "the gamma - ray emission was apparently steady over this time period and was correlated with the x - ray periodicity .",
    "additional evidence for gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3 was later reported by other air shower detectors .    at extremely - high energies ( e @xmath20ev )",
    ", evidence was presented for neutral particles from the direction of cygnus x-3 by the fly s eye @xcite and by akeno @xcite groups , based on data taken during the periods 1981 - 1989 and 1984 - 1989 , respectively .",
    "these data apparently indicated steady emission of neutral particles from cygnus x-3 that was uncorrelated with the x - ray periodicity .",
    "the haverah park experiment , operating in the same energy range , and during much of the same period in time , found no evidence for such emission @xcite .",
    "the evidence from ground - based experiments for gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3 from 1975 to 1990 is shown in figure  [ fig : oldcyg ] . here , the integral gamma - ray fluxes are plotted as a function of energy .",
    "also shown is a single power law fit of the form e@xmath21 .",
    "the fact that the gamma - ray fluxes at widely varying energies could be approximately fit by a single power law was taken by some as evidence of a unified acceleration mechanism at the source .",
    "one should note , however , that all results shown in figure  [ fig : oldcyg ] represent _ integral _ flux measurements by experiments incapable of accurately measuring differential fluxes .",
    "since the detections were generally only marginally statistically significant , the reported fluxes equally represent the three to four standard deviation sensitivity of each instrument at a fixed energy .",
    "the fluxes therefore would naturally fall on an e@xmath3 power law , if the sensitivities of the experiments scaled linearly with energy ( which was approximately true for these first - generation experiments ) .",
    "it has also been pointed out that even if the source mechanism produced emission with a single power law form , the _ detected _ flux at earth would have a significant dip between @xmath22 and @xmath23tev because of absorption of gamma - rays by the cosmic microwave radiation @xcite .    starting with the cygnus experiment in 1988 @xcite ,",
    "a number of more sensitive ground - based experiments were unable to detect gamma - ray emission from cygnus x-3 , at levels significantly lower than the earlier reports .",
    "upper limits on the flux were reported for experiments using both the atmospheric cherenkov technique @xcite , as well as the ground - array technique @xcite . using parts of the eventual casa - mia detector ,",
    "some of us reported limits for data taken in 1988 - 1989 @xcite and in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the general trend of a `` quiet '' cygnus x-3 continued into the early 1990 s , although there were several publications claiming gamma - ray emission based largely on data that had been taken in the previous decade @xcite .      like cygnus x-3 , hercules x-1 is a powerful binary x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is modulated on a time scale of 1.7 days which is assumed to result from the orbital motion of the binary pair . unlike cygnus x-3 , hercules x-1 is not seen in radio , but has been observed for many years in the optical range @xcite and a @xmath24kpc distance to the source has been determined @xcite .",
    "in addition , hercules x-1 contains an x - ray pulsar with a period of @xmath25sec @xcite , but whose ephemeris is relatively poorly determined because of unpredictable variations in the spin - up rate @xcite .",
    "hercules x-1 has not been detected by space - borne gamma - ray instruments .",
    "the first evidence from a ground - based observatory for gamma - ray emission from hercules x-1 was reported in 1984 by the durham group using the atmospheric cherenkov technique @xcite .",
    "the reported gamma - ray emission came in the form of a short burst ( @xmath26 minute duration ) that exhibited 1.24 sec periodicity .",
    "following this report , additional pulsed emission was claimed by cherenkov detectors operating at ultra - high energies ( e @xmath27tev ) @xcite and at tev energies @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing evidence for gamma - ray emission from hercules x-1 came from data taken in 1986 by three experiments .",
    "data taken between april and july of 1986 by the haleakala @xcite and whipple @xcite telescopes operating near @xmath9tev , and by the cygnus experiment @xcite in july of 1986 operating at energies above @xmath28tev , all indicated evidence for gamma - ray emission from hercules x-1 in the form of short bursts of approximately 0.5 hr duration . in addition , the emission detected by each experiment exhibited a common periodicity near @xmath29sec , which differed by a significant amount ( @xmath30 lower ) from the known x - ray period .",
    "the data from the cygnus experiment was further puzzling because the events from the direction of hercules x-1 had a muon content that was similar to the cosmic ray background events , whereas gamma - ray events should have contained significantly fewer muons .",
    "later , two groups with somewhat poorer sensitivity presented additional evidence for gamma - ray emission from hercules x-1 at different times in 1986 at tev @xcite and @xmath14tev @xcite energies .    since the advent of upgraded and improved experiments in the early 1990 s , the gamma - ray signals from hercules x-1 disappeared from the published literature .",
    "the whipple group , using a more sensitive cherenkov imaging technique , failed to detect emission from hercules x-1 , and found no statistically significant evidence for gamma - ray emission from hercules x-1 over a six year period , even including their data from 1986 @xcite .",
    "an enlarged and improved cygnus experiment also failed to see gamma - rays from hercules x-1 in the period between 1987 and 1991 @xcite .",
    "using data taken in 1989 , we reported upper limits on the emission of gamma - rays from hercules x-1 using part of the eventual casa - mia experiment @xcite .      the many claims of very high energy gamma - ray emission from the binary systems cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 fueled great interest in the development of astrophysical models to explain such emission .",
    "there were also non - standard particle physics models put forward to explain the observations ; these models will not be discussed here .    for the case of cygnus x-3 , where the gamma - ray emission was generally observed with a @xmath7hr periodicity , the astrophysical models needed to incorporate the orbital dynamics of the binary system .",
    "models in which an energetic pulsar alone served as the power source for the gamma - rays @xcite or in which accretion powered the gamma - rays @xcite were proposed .",
    "these models generally had difficulty in producing gamma - rays at energies above @xmath12ev .",
    "more popular were a general class of models in which the gamma - rays were produced from the decays of @xmath31 mesons made in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "the hadronic beam resulted from diffusive shock acceleration , perhaps near the neutron star , and possible beam targets included the atmosphere of the companion star or material in the accretion disk .",
    "such `` beam - dump '' models were capable of explaining gamma - rays at ultra - high energies and were also able to accommodate the observed periodicities of the gamma - ray signals .",
    "several authors recognized that in order to explain the ultra - high energy gamma - ray fluxes initially seen , the required luminosity of cygnus x-3 would also be sufficient to account for a substantial fraction of the high energy cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "hillas pointed out that if cygnus x-3 consisted of a @xmath15ev accelerator with a luminosity of @xmath32ergs / sec , only one such object like it would be required to explain the origin of cosmic rays above @xmath33ev @xcite .    unlike cygnus x-3 , the gamma - ray emission from hercules",
    "x-1 was not seen to be correlated with the orbital motion of the binary system , but instead with the pulsar periodicity .",
    "this observation , along with evidence that the emission appeared in the form of short bursts , led naturally to models in which the pulsar itself was the power source . in such models , the gamma - rays were produced by the interaction of a charged particle beam with the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "more difficult to explain were the 1986 observations of gamma - ray emission at a slightly shorter period than the x - ray period .",
    "the anomalous gamma - ray periodicity was explained by the presence of matter in the accretion disk which periodically obscured the gamma - ray interaction region @xcite .    in summary",
    ", although theoretical difficulties existed in explaining the apparent signals of gamma - rays from cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 , the signals were tantalizing because of the possibility that they revealed important sources of the ultra - high energy cosmic ray flux .",
    "the casa - mia experiment is located in dugway , utah , usa ( @xmath34n , @xmath35w ) at an altitude of @xmath36 m above sea level ( @xmath37g/@xmath38 atmospheric depth ) .",
    "casa - mia consists of two major components : the chicago air shower array ( casa ) , a large surface array of scintillation detectors , and the michigan array ( mia ) , a buried array of scintillation counters sensitive to the muonic component of air showers .",
    "casa consists of 1089 scintillation detectors placed on a @xmath39 m square grid and enclosing an area of @xmath40m@xmath41 .",
    "construction on the array started in 1988 and a small portion ( 5% ) of the experiment operated in 1989 .",
    "a more substantial portion ( @xmath4250% ) of it was completed by early 1990 .",
    "data collection with this portion started on march 1 , 1990 .",
    "additional detectors were added in 1990 to complete the construction .",
    "mia consists of 1024 scintillation counters located beneath casa in 16 groupings ( patches ) .",
    "the total active scintillator area is @xmath43m@xmath41 and the counters are buried beneath @xmath44 m of soil .",
    "this depth corresponds to a muon threshold energy of approximately @xmath45gev .",
    "parts of mia were operational as early as 1987 , 50% of the experiment was completed by early 1990 , and the entire array was working by early 1991 .",
    "the casa - mia experiment was turned off temporarily in 1991 for repair due to lightning damage , but has operated essentially uninterrupted since that time .",
    "table  [ tab : array ] summarizes the size and detector makeup of casa - mia as a function of time .    .",
    "size and makeup of casa - mia experiment as a function of time for the data sample used in this analysis .",
    "a range of values indicates that the experiment was being enlarged during this period of time .",
    "data taken after august 1995 are not used in this analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as described earlier , the many detections of cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 by experiments operating between 1975 and 1990 varied greatly in their characteristics .",
    "some results were steady and some were episodic ; some exhibited apparent periodicity and others did not .",
    "we thus choose to compare the results of this work to a generalized picture of the earlier results and to more recent work .      in figure",
    "[ fig : newcyg ] , we plot the flux limits reported here on steady emission from cygnus x-3 . we also show published results from other experiments using data taken at times which overlap our observation period .",
    "the other results come from the tibet air shower array in yangbajing , china @xcite , the cygnus array in new mexico , usa @xcite , the eas - top array at gran sasso , italy @xcite , and the hegra experiment on the canary island la palma @xcite .",
    "we do not show earlier results from data taken by a portion of our experiment in 1989 @xcite or the results of our all - sky survey for northern hemisphere point sources using data taken in 1990 - 1991 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : cygfract ] , we show a similar comparison of the limits on the fractional excess of events from cygnus x-3 relative to the cosmic ray background .    the data from the recent experiments are consistent ; no steady emission of ultra - high energy particles ( gamma - ray or otherwise ) has been detected from cygnus x-3 at levels which are considerably lower than earlier reports . at tev energies ,",
    "the results from the whipple telescope @xcite are also considerably lower than the earlier reports .",
    "the limits presented here are a factor of 130 lower at @xmath46tev , and a factor of 900 at @xmath47tev , than the spectrum plotted in figure  [ fig : oldcyg ] .",
    "our results are also inconsistent with emission reported by a smaller experiment using data taken during a time that overlapped our observations @xcite .",
    "the limits presented here on transient emission from cygnus x-3 are lower than , but in agreement with , those reported by other air shower experiments .",
    "there have been no compelling reports of transient emission of gamma - rays from cygnus x-3 over the period 1990 - 1995 , including during large radio flares from the source .",
    "there was an observation of underground muons from the direction of cygnus x-3 during the january 1991 radio flare @xcite .",
    "the reported flux for this observation was @xmath48 muons @xmath2 sec@xmath3 , for muon energies above @xmath49tev .",
    "if the muons were produced in air showers by the interaction of a hypothetical neutral particle from cygnus x-3 , we would expect a typical neutral particle energy of @xmath16tev @xcite . assuming that the particle spectrum continues to energies detectable by casa - mia ( and conservatively using a soft spectrum comparable to the cosmic rays )",
    ", one derives an expected flux of @xmath50 particles @xmath2 sec@xmath3 for energies above @xmath46tev .",
    "this flux is a factor of 5 to 10 above the flux limits set by casa - mia on the emission of any neutral particle during the january 1991 flare ( table  [ tab : flare_results ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that there is no evidence for @xmath7 periodic emission from cygnus x-3 .",
    "this result is consistent with reports by other experiments over the same period of time .",
    "the limits on pulsed gamma - ray emission presented here for the phase intervals of 0.2 - 0.3 and 0.6 - 0.7 ( table  [ tab : cygphase ] ) are lower at @xmath46tev , and considerably lower at @xmath51tev , than the fluxes predicted by a recent theoretical paper @xcite .",
    "the limits on steady emission of gamma - rays from hercules x-1 presented here are in agreement with those from other experiments , as shown in figure  [ fig : newher ] .",
    "gamma - ray emission from hercules x-1 was typically seen by earlier experiments as transient emission over short time scales ( e.g. the 1986 outbursts ) .",
    "we have no evidence for such emission over the entire period 1990 - 1995 . in figure",
    "[ fig : hertran1994 ] , we compare the daily event totals observed by casa - mia from the direction of hercules x-1 to the total expected assuming the flux of an earlier reported outburst @xcite . clearly , no evidence for emission at even much weaker levels than this outburst is seen during this time . the flux reported in ref .",
    "@xcite was @xmath52 particles @xmath2 sec@xmath3 for minimum energies of @xmath14tev .",
    "this flux is about a factor of 45 larger than the typical limits placed by casa - mia during the early part of operations and about a factor of 80 larger than the typical daily gamma - ray limits placed by the full casa - mia experiment ( table  [ tab : daily ] ) .",
    "since we have no evidence for transient emission from hercules x-1 , we choose not to carry out a periodicity analysis based on the x - ray pulsar period of @xmath25sec .",
    "we have carried out a high statistics search for ultra - high energy neutral and gamma - ray particle emission from cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 between 1990 and 1995 .",
    "we have no evidence for steady or transient emission from either source , and for cygnus x-3 , we have no evidence for @xmath7hr periodic emission or emission correlated with large radio flares .",
    "these results are in agreement with those from other experiments operating during the same period of time , but are in stark contrast to earlier ( 1975 - 1990 ) reports .",
    "the apparent disappearance of cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 from the ultra - high energy gamma - ray sky can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "an optimistic view @xcite is that the earlier results indicated the presence of ultra - high energy gamma - rays ( or particles ) from cygnus x-3 and hercules x-1 , and that the sources , which are episodic on long times scales , are now dormant .",
    "a more pessimistic view is that the earlier reported detections were largely , if not entirely , statistical fluctuations , and that no compelling evidence exists for ultra - high energy gamma - rays from any astrophysical source .",
    "we point out that an earlier all - sky survey using a portion of our data sample indicates that the northern hemisphere does not contain any steady point sources of gamma - rays with fluxes comparable to those reported from x - ray binaries in the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "we have presented an update on this analysis at a conference @xcite which are consistent with the absence of bright 100 tev gamma - ray point sources .",
    "we are in the process of completing a final all - sky survey on the five year casa - mia data sample .",
    "the pessimistic interpretation of the ultra - high energy point source question , if correct , highlights the difficulties in detecting gamma - rays from sources at other ( high ) energies and in detecting neutrinos as well .",
