    "contact interactions have been studied thoroughly in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "different studies have illustrated some of the analogies between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the analogies are still to a large extent ambiguous . in our opinion , studying contact interactions relativistically give a better chance for understanding the relation between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , especially quantum field theory is basically a theory for describing the interaction of relativistic particles .",
    "the problem of relativistic @xmath0-function potential has been studied in the mathematical literature in the context of the theory of self - adjoint extensions of pseudo - differential operators @xcite . lately , we studied the problem by directly solving the relativistic version of the schrdinger equation of the hamiltonian @xmath1 in 1-d @xcite . unlike the textbook case of the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential , the relativistic problem gives rise to ultra - violet divergences that required regularization and renormalization .",
    "previously , we used dimensional regularization to show that the system has remarkable features .",
    "for example , the relatively simple system shares many features with some complex quantum field theories , like asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation in the massless limit , and it also possesses an infra - red conformal fixed point .    in quantum field theory",
    "it is well known that in some cases , different regularization methods give different results for the same problem @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for non - local quantum field theories @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that for the non - relativistic @xmath0- function potential in odd @xmath2 , the dimensional regularization gives different results than the cutoff regularization , provided that the calculation is done in a non - perturbative setting .    in the case of the relativistic schrdinger equation ,",
    "the hamiltonian is nonlocal unlike the non - relativistic case .",
    "a naive guess would tell us that for this case , and for a certain problem , different regularization methods give different results .",
    "however , in this paper we prove that this is not the case for the solution of the relativistic schrdinger equation for a point particle in an external 1-dimensional @xmath0-function potential .",
    "we study the solution in a non - perturbative setting using cutoff regularization .",
    "it gives exactly the same results from our previous calculations using dimensional regularization .",
    "this important because it is an evidence of universality .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as the following : section 2 is for studying the bound state problem non - relativistically and relativistically using contour integrals .",
    "section 3 is for discussing the gap equation and cutoff regularization , and using the bound state energy to define a renormalization condition .",
    "section 4 for studying the scattering state problem non - relativistically and relativistically with the use of contour integrals , and defining the energy - dependence of the running coupling constant .",
    "section 5 is for the conclusions .",
    "the non - relativistic solution of the schrdinger equation for the @xmath0-function potential is a textbook problem .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss it briefly to highlight the similarities and differences between the non - relativistic and relativistic case , especially regarding the contour integration approach used to calculate the wave function in both cases .",
    "the schrdinger equation for this case is @xmath3 in momentum space , the above equation takes the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5 accordingly , in coordinate space the wave function for the bound state is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the binding energy , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the bound state energy . the value of @xmath10 in the above equation can be obtained using contour integral .",
    "the contour in this case has one pole inside the upper half circle at @xmath11 , as it is illustrated in figure.1 top panel . for the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential ,",
    "the wave function of the bound state is finite at the origin , and it is given by the following equation @xmath12    1.6 cm    the relativistic time - independent schrdinger equation is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare coupling constant . in momentum space , the above equation is @xmath15 solving for @xmath16 , we get @xmath17 from the above equation , we express the bound state wave function in coordinate space as @xmath18 again here , the value of @xmath19 in the above equation can be obtained using contour integral . for a bound state @xmath20 , the contour in this case has one pole inside the upper half circle at @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , it has a branch cut along the positive imaginary axis starting at @xmath22 as it is illustrated in figure.1 ( bottom panel ) . for this case @xmath23 is @xmath24.\\ ] ] for a strong bound state when @xmath25 , and for an ultra - strong bound state",
    "when @xmath26 , the pole does not have a residue .",
    "for this case @xmath19 is @xmath27 both wave functions are logarithmically divergent at the origin .    in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath28 , the relativistic wave function of eq.([boundstate ] ) reduces to @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "the wave function indeed reduces to the non - relativistic wave function of eq.([nonrelbound ] ) .",
    "however , the divergence of the relativistic wave function persists for any non - zero value of @xmath31 . on the other hand , the strong bound and the ultra strong bound states",
    "do not have a non - relativistic limit .",
    "they are purely relativistic states .",
    "from eq.([psip ] ) and eq.([fourier ] ) , we get @xmath32 the above equation gives @xmath33 where @xmath34 depends on the value of @xmath9 .",
    "the above equation determines the relation between @xmath14 and the bound state energy @xmath9 .",
    "the integral in eq.([gap ] ) is logarithmically ultra - violet divergent , therefore it needs to be regularized .",
    "we do this by using the momentum cutoff regularization . to proceed with this ,",
    "first we must isolate the term that is causing the divergency .",
    "we do that by expanding the integrand in eq.([gap ] ) in powers of @xmath35 , and then we get @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the momentum cutoff . by integrating term by term , and then taking the limit @xmath38",
    ", we find that all terms under the summation sign are finite , while the first term is logarithmically ultra - violet divergent .",
    "the resultant series from the second term converges for @xmath39 , and can be summed .",
    "accordingly , we can write @xmath34 as @xmath40 or @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the finite part of @xmath34 . in this case , @xmath43 for an ultra - strong bound state with energy @xmath44 the series diverges .",
    "still , the result can be obtained by directly integrating the convergent expression , and taking the limit @xmath38 @xmath45 as a renormalization condition , we fix the binding energy @xmath9 in units of the mass @xmath46 , such that the running bare coupling is given by @xmath47 at the non - relativistic limit , the binding energy @xmath48 is small compared to the rest mass . in this case , the running bare coupling is given by @xcite @xmath49 here it is very useful to compare the above equation with the non - relativistic contact interaction @xmath50 , which does not require renormalization , for the attractive delta @xmath51 , the bound state energy is given by @xmath52 , or @xmath53 .",
    "this suggests to define a renormalized coupling @xmath54 as @xmath55",
    "for the non - relativistic scattering states , we assume that the solution in momentum space has the following ansatz @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 . after substituting eq.([generalansatznon ] ) into eq.([schrpnon ] ) , we get @xmath58 @xmath59 in the above equation , the value of @xmath60 can be obtained using contour integral . in this case",
    ", the contour has two poles on the real axis at @xmath61 as it is illustrated in figure.2 top panel . after calculating @xmath60 ,",
    "it is straightforward to calculate @xmath62 , which is @xmath63.\\ ] ] for the non - relativistic @xmath0-function potential , the wave function of the scattering state is finite at the origin .    1.6 cm    for the relativistic case , the ansatz takes the following form @xcite @xmath64 by substituting eq.([generalansatz ] ) into eq.([relschrp ] ) , and after solving for @xmath65 , we get @xmath66 where @xmath67 . from eq.([phirel ] ) , and by using momentum cutoff regularization , we can write @xmath68 the integral in the above equation is similar to the one in eq.([gap ] ) , with the exception that @xmath69 . therefore , we can write @xmath70 as in the case of @xmath34 , the term causing the divergency is @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the convergent part of @xmath74 for @xmath75 . it can be obtained from eq.([iebu ] ) after replacing @xmath9 by @xmath76 , and we get @xmath77 now , we substitute for @xmath78 from eq.([phizerodelta ] ) into eq.([phirel ] ) , and also substituting for @xmath14 from eq.([gap ] ) , we get @xmath79 from eq.([iebg ] ) and eq.([ie0 ] ) , it is obvious that ultra - violet divergences of @xmath74 and @xmath34 is canceled .",
    "therefore , we can say in this case that the problem is renormalizable .",
    "accordingly , eq.([phipdelta1final ] ) can be written as @xmath80 certainly @xmath81 is a finite quantity .",
    "the value of @xmath60 can be obtained from eq.([phipdelta1final2 ] ) using contour integral .",
    "the contour in this case has two poles on the real axis at @xmath82 , and it has a branch cut along the positive imaginary axis starting at @xmath22 as it is illustrated in figure.2 bottom panel . after calculating @xmath83 , it is straightforward to calculate @xmath62 , which is @xmath84 , \\",

    "\\delta e = \\frac{k^2}{2m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath88 reduces to the non - relativistic wave function of eq.([psiscatnon ] )",
    ". however , the divergence of the relativistic wave function persists . nevertheless , comparing eq.([psiscatlimit ] ) with eq.([psiscatnon ] ) together with eq.([i - ieq ] ) is telling us that @xmath89 is nothing but the energy - dependent running coupling constant @xmath90 which is renormalized at the scale @xmath9 , and finite for @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath91^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we proved that cutoff regularization gives the same results as dimensional regularization for the problem of the schrdinger equation for a relativistic point particle in an external 1-dimensional @xmath0-function potential . in both cases ,",
    "the ultra - violet divergences have been canceled , and in both cases we get the same energy - dependent running coupling constant @xmath90 , which is renormalized at the scale @xmath9 , and finite .",
    "this means that the features that was obtained using dimensional regularization in @xcite are preserved when using cutoff regularization .",
