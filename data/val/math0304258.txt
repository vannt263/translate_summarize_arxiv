    "if @xmath102 is anisotropic , the sets of fixed points of nonzero elements have no common nonzero elements .",
    "thus the corresponding three pairs of lines are skew .",
    "an orthogonal anisotropic plane @xmath751 defines another 6 skew lines such that each fix - line defined by @xmath102 intersects each fix - line defined by @xmath751 .",
    "let @xmath752 be the unique quadric in @xmath399 which contains 3 fix - lines defined by @xmath102 . then",
    "each fix - line defined by @xmath751 must lie in @xmath752 .",
    "then the remaining 3 fix - lines defined by @xmath102 also must lie in @xmath752 .",

    "there are 10 such pairs , so we obtain 10 quadrics . they are called _ klein s",
    "fundamental quadrics_.    consider the tensor square of the schrdinger linear representation in the dual space @xmath754 .",

    "the kummer configuration can be obtained as follows .",
    "take an arbitrary point @xmath760 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath761 with respect to the schrdinger representation gives a set of 16 points .",
    "the images of @xmath761 under @xmath762 define 6 planes .",
    "the polar plane of @xmath761 with respect to the fundamental quadrics ( defined by the orthogonal subspace of the corresponding line in @xmath730 ) define another 10 planes .",
    "thus we get a set of 16 points and a set of 16 planes .",
    "there exists a unique kummer surface in @xmath399 which realizes these sets as the set of 16 nodes and 16 tropes .    recall that each element in @xmath763 defines a hyperplane section of the grassmannian @xmath398 in its plcker embedding",
    "thus each subset of 4 fundamental complexes @xmath762 define a pair of lines in @xmath399 .",
    "together we get 15 pairs of lines .",
    "this is the set of 30 edges of the 15 fundamental tetrahedra . in this way",

    "a jacobian kummer surface is obtained as the image of the linear system @xmath596 on the jacobian variety of a genus 2 curve . a minimal nonsingular model of the kummer surface of a simple abelian surface with polarization of type @xmath765 admits an embedding in @xmath399 as a quartic surface with two sets of 16 disjoint lines forming a symmetric @xmath764-design of type @xmath766 .",
