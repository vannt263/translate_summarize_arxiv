    "the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) has been regarded as a fundamental principle in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "it concerns time - integrated quantities such as heat and work in nonequilibrium processes .",
    "the ft provides a rigorous rule for the thermal fluctuations of such quantities , independent of any detailed dynamics .",
    "the first form of the ft was found for entropy production piled in a heat bath for a deterministic thermostated system  @xcite , given as @xmath0 as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the measuring time and @xmath3 is the entropy production rate in the unit of the boltzmann constant @xmath4 .",
    "here the bracket @xmath5 denotes the average or integral over all the fluctuations .",
    "it is termed as a steady - state integral ft in literature .",
    "later , the ft was found to hold in stochastic systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , crooks showed that the ( transient ) ft rigorously holds at all times ( finite @xmath2 ) for the work @xmath6 produced in nonequilibrium systems starting from equilibrium distributions .",
    "furthermore , it can be expressed in a more detailed form , termed as a detailed ft , regarding the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of work fluctuations , given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the inverse temperature of the heat bath and @xmath9 the free energy difference between the initial and final times due to the change in a time - dependent protocol such as a volume , an external field , or a potential shape .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the pdf for the forward ( @xmath11 ) process , while @xmath12 denotes that for the reverse ( @xmath13 ) process where the protocol varies in time reversely to the forward process .",
    "the symmetry of the pdf such as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cft ] ) is known , in general , as the gallavotti - cohen symmetry  @xcite . the jarzynski equality @xmath14",
    "@xcite is nothing but the integral ft corresponding to the crooks detailed ft .",
    "the discovery of the ft , which is expected to be valid in general stochastic systems , has resulted in extensive studies on unprecedented nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "many experimental evidences have also been reported  @xcite .",
    "the choice of an initial ensemble is critical for the validity of the ft .",
    "for example , the transient detailed fts for any finite @xmath2 hold and so do the integral fts , only with the equilibrium boltzmann distribution as the initial ensemble for the work or with the uniform ( infinite - temperature ) distributions for the heat  @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "[ subsec : level33 ] ) .",
    "the total entropy production satisfies the transient integral ft with an arbitrary initial ensemble  @xcite , though its detailed ft is valid only in the steady state .",
    "in fact , the detailed ft guarantees the integral ft , but the converse is true only if the initial distributions for the forward and reverse paths are _ involutary _ to each other  @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises as `` what happens to the ft when other types of initial ensembles are taken ? '' .",
    "it is clear that the transient ft does not hold without a proper initial ensemble corresponding to a time - integrated quantity , but , is the ( steady - state ) ft in the @xmath15 limit not valid for the time - integrated quantities , either ? if not , how can the initial memory persist in the long - time limit ? in order to answer these questions",
    ", we investigate the effect of initial ensembles on the detailed ft for the heat and work , in particular for large @xmath2 .",
    "it is a formidable task to calculate the pdf exactly for finite @xmath2 , so we restrict ourselves only to its large deviation function and corrections in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the pdf for a time - integrated quantity @xmath16 for a long period of time @xmath2 can be written in a scaling form @xmath17 where @xmath16 is usually scaled dimensionless and @xmath18 is called a large deviation function ( ldf ) .",
    "many interesting properties on the ldf were found on such as the current fluctuations  @xcite , the ( non - gaussian ) exponential tail  @xcite , the everlasting initial memory threshold  @xcite , and so on . if the detailed ft holds , the gallavotti - cohen ( gc ) symmetry is expressed in terms of the ldfs as @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the ldf for the forward ( reverse ) process .",
    "when @xmath22 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cft ] ) leads to the above symmetry in the large @xmath2 limit  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic first law reads @xmath23 for the energy change @xmath24 .",
    "we define @xmath25 as the heat transferred into the heat bath . in nonequilibrium close to the steady state ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 grow linearly in @xmath2 , but @xmath28 remains finite .",
    "thus , one might expect that both quantities approximately have the identical pdfs for large @xmath2 as the difference @xmath24 may become negligible . starting with the equilibrium boltzmann ensemble ,",
    "the detailed ft for @xmath6 is satisfied even at finite @xmath2 , and thus is expected to be valid also for @xmath25 at least in the infinite @xmath2 limit .",
    "however , the reality is against the expectation .",
    "the detailed ft for the heat was examined analytically for the motion of a particle in a harmonic potential dragged with a constant velocity , which is one of the experimental prototypes  @xcite .",
    "it was found in the infinite @xmath2 limit that @xmath29 only in the central region around @xmath30  @xcite , while it approaches a plateau for large @xmath31 , which is the origin of the extended ft  @xcite .",
    "recently , the modification of the detailed ft for the heat has been proposed for general systems in terms of correlations between @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the violation of the ft is due to a rare but non - negligible chance of @xmath24 having an extremely large value , which causes the ft modified in the tail region of the pdf  @xcite .",
    "the probability to find the initial system with an extremely large energy is exponentially small , but it will almost always dissipate the most of its energy into the reservoir in the long - time limit . thus , this event becomes relevant to the tail part of the heat pdf which also decays exponentially for large @xmath31 .",
    "even for very large @xmath2 and @xmath31 , there is always an exponentially small probability to find the event with the corresponding large energy in the initial boltzmann ensemble .",
    "therefore , this effect can not go away even in the long - time limit .",
    "this so - called `` boundary effect '' recognized in many references  @xcite is observed for an unbounded energy distribution in the initial ensemble , but obviously not observed when the initial energy is bounded .",
    "as the initial ensemble plays a crucial role in the ft violation , we study its effect on the work and heat fluctuations more systematically in this paper . as an initial ensemble , we take the boltzmann distribution at a temperature generally different from that of the heat reservoir . in this case , the fts for both @xmath6 and @xmath25 do not hold for finite @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether the ft will hold or not in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the validity may depend on the quantity of interest and also on the temperature of the initial ensemble .",
    "in fact , it is already reported that the injected and dissipated pdf s of heat in an equilibration process show phase transitions at two different finite initial temperatures , respectively , below which the ldf is not affected , while above which the ldf is significantly modified by the boundary term  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the problem of a brownian particle in a harmonic potential dragged with a constant velocity , which is in contact with the thermal reservoir .",
    "we then investigate the pdfs of the work and heat for a long period of @xmath2 .",
    "for the heat pdf , we find the singularities due to the boundary terms , which vary with the temperature of the initial ensemble and break the gc symmetry of the pdf . as the initial temperature approaches the infinity in the infinite-@xmath2 limit , the gc symmetry is restored .",
    "we also calculated a finite-@xmath2 correction for the heat pdf , where the singularity structure becomes more complicated .",
    "using the modified saddle point integral method recently developed by us  @xcite , we exactly obtained the ldf of the heat up to @xmath32 and thus the ft violation is measured up to the same order .",
    "interestingly , the finite-@xmath2 correction of the ft violation does not vanish in the infinite initial - temperature limit , which implies the non - commutativity between the two limits of the infinite @xmath2 and the infinite initial temperature .",
    "however , we can show that the transient ft is satisfied for any @xmath2 if one takes a proper infinite initial - temperature limit before taking the infinite-@xmath2 limit .",
    "in contrast , the work pdf turns out to be free of any singularity even at any initial temperature .",
    "furthermore , the work pdf can be calculated exactly at any finite @xmath2 and any initial temperature .",
    "we can show that the transient ft does not hold except when the initial temperature is identical to the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "however , in the infinite-@xmath2 limit , the ft is fully restored , regardless of the initial temperature .",
    "the difference between the ft violations for the heat and work comes from the presence of @xmath24 , which induces everlasting initial memory in the heat pdf .",

    "<S> we revisit the problem of a brownian particle in a harmonic potential dragged with a constant velocity , which is in contact with a thermal reservoir . the heat and work fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> are investigated with initial boltzmann ensembles at temperatures generally different from the reservoir temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the infinite - time limit , the ft for the work is fully recovered for arbitrary initial temperatures , while the heat fluctuations significantly deviate from the ft characteristics except for the infinite initial - temperature limit ( a uniform initial ensemble ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we succeed in calculating finite - time corrections to the heat and work distributions analytically , using the modified saddle point integral method recently developed by us . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find non - commutativity between the infinite - time limit and the infinite - initial - temperature limit for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the heat . </S>"
