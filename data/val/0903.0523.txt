    "fuzzy observables arise in several ways in quantum formalism .",
    "their history goes back to the 1970s , and they were one of the first concrete examples of genuine positive operator valued measures ( povms ) in quantum mechanics . for commutative povms , this concept gives useful representation theorems in terms of projection valued measures ( pvms ) . on the other hand ,",
    "fuzzification is a natural way to model reduction in the statistical description of the system .",
    "fuzzy observables are also intimately related to the topic of joint measurements .    in this article",
    "we discuss all these aspects of fuzzy observables . in section [ sec : history ]",
    "we give a brief historical overview of fuzzy observables .",
    "section [ sec : povm ] contains some basic definitions and fixes the notation . in section",
    "[ sec : commutative ] we present two representation theorems for commutative povms . in section",
    "[ sec : fuzzy ] we explain the connection of these results to the concept of fuzzy observables .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : joint ] we present some remarks related to joint measurements .",
    "the appearance of positive operator valued measures in studying of the foundations of quantum mechanics followed along several lines .",
    "the axiomatization of quantum mechanics , built upon an analysis of the measurement process , as undertaken by gnther ludwig and the marburg school in the 1960 s and 70 s @xcite , led to the notion of generalized observables , which went beyond the orthodox concept of an observable in quantum mechanics .",
    "an observable in this more general setting turned out to be a positive operator valued measure on a hilbert space .",
    "the @xmath0-algebra of this measure was generally built on the set of possible values of the observable or observables , the implication being that it was theoretically possible to discuss joint measurements of incompatible observables .",
    "thus , in orthodox quantum mechanics the observables of position and momentum are each characterized by projection valued measures , i.e. , the spectral projectors of the corresponding self adjoint operators , defined on the space of possible observed values of position and momentum , and they are not simultaneously measurable . in the more general setting , it is entirely possible to discuss the joint measurement of these two observables , using a positive operator valued measure defined on the joint set of values of classical position and momentum .",
    "of course , in such a joint measurement neither position nor momentum can assume sharp values , implying necessarily a certain _ fuzzification .",
    "_ this line of thought leads to a one type of formulation of heisenberg s uncertainty principle - a condition ensuring that mutually exclusive measurements of position and momentum can be reconciled if an appropriate trade - off is accepted .",
    "for a recent exposition of this topic , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the second line of development , which led to the use of povms was the generalization of the notion of a conditional expectation in probability theory .",
    "an algebraic formulation of the notion of conditional expectation , in the context of classical , i.e. , commutative , probability theory was worked out in the 1950 s @xcite , which was further developed and extended to non - commutative probability theories , in which the classical algebra of stochastic variables was replaced by a non - abelian von neumann algebra .",
    "such a generalization , apart from its intrinsic mathematical interest , was then shown to be useful in discussions of the measurement process in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "later , davies and lewis , in developing an operational basis for quantum measurement theory and a related theory of quantum stochastic processes , @xcite gave a definition of a conditional expectation , as the dual to the concept of a measurement .",
    "this had the virtue of extending the von neumann collapse postulate to observables with continuous spectra .",
    "each measurement process then singled out an observable , defined as a povm .",
    "there is at least one more significant and independent line of development involving povms , which started in the early 1970s , and most notably expounded and developed in the works of holevo and helstrom @xcite . here",
    "the notion of a povm appeared in the then emerging field of quantum information and statistical decision theory , essentially independently of the ideas of ludwig on quantum foundations and davies and lewis on repeated measurements .",
    "this pioneering work led to the recognition of the fact that the statistics of optimal quantum measurements is often obtained by using what were called _",
    "non - orthogonal povms_. simultaneously , the relevance of naimark s extension theorem ( from povms to projection valued measures ) , was first pointed out in this context .",
    "the idea that povms could in some sense describe unsharp measurements was already present in the work of davies and lewis .",
    "these ideas were further developed to a more complete theory of fuzzy observables in @xcite . in the succeeding years",
    "the connection between unsharp or fuzzy observables and povms has been worked out in great detail by a number of authors . for a systematic presentation of various aspects of povms",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "quantum observables are mathematically described by positive operator valued measures . in this section",
    "we shortly recall this concept and fix the notation .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hausdorff locally compact second countable topological space ( lcsc space , for short ) .",
    "we use the following notations :    * @xmath2 is the borel @xmath0-algebra of @xmath1 * @xmath3 is the banach space of countinuous complex functions on @xmath1 vanishing at infinity , endowed with the uniform norm * @xmath4 is the banach space of complex measures on @xmath1 endowed with the total variation norm * @xmath5 is the subset of positive elements in @xmath4 * @xmath6 is the subset of probability measures    we will regard an element @xmath7 both as a @xmath0-additive mapping @xmath8 and as a bounded linear functional @xmath9 . in the latter case , we have the isometric isomorphism @xmath10 . in general , if @xmath11 denotes the banach space of bounded measurable complex functions on @xmath1 endowed with the uniform norm , an element @xmath7 determines a bounded linear functional @xmath12 by means of the formula @xmath13 we let @xmath14 be the unit ball in @xmath4 , and @xmath14 is endowed with the weak*-topology . since @xmath3 is separable , @xmath14 is a compact metrizable space .",

    "the basic numerical predictions of quantum mechanics - the measurement outcome probability distributions - are given by the trace formula .",
    "namely , the number @xmath45 is interpreted as the probability that a measurement outcome @xmath46 occurs when a measurement of the observable @xmath21 is performed and the system is in the state @xmath47 .    if @xmath1 is compact , then @xmath48 , the space of continuous functions on @xmath1 . item ( ii ) in definition ( b ) is equivalent to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the constant function @xmath51 .    for a subset @xmath52 ,",

    "this topic has been recently studied by jenov and pulmannov in @xcite,@xcite , where related results have been obtained .",

    "markov kernels can add different kind of fuzziness to outcome sets .",
    "first of all , a markov kernel can make outcome sets blurred .",
    "this happens , for instance , if in the situation of example [ ex : covariant - markov ] the probability measure @xmath233 is of the form @xmath284 and @xmath261 is some smooth function ( e.g. gaussian function ) .",
    "this can typically model noise or imprecision in a measurement .",
    "there is also another class of markov kernels , which describe different kind of reduction .",
    "namely , it can happen that a markov kernel maps sets into sets ( and not into genuine fuzzy sets ) , in which case there is thus no blurring .",
    "the possible reduction is now a consequence of the fact that two or more outcomes may become identified as one .",
    "this latter kind of situation corresponds to a markov kernel @xmath98 determined by a measurable function @xmath285 , i.e. , @xmath286 ( @xmath287 is the dirac measure at @xmath288 ) .",
    "the function @xmath289 simply relabels the outcomes , possibly giving same label to several different outcomes .",
    ".   now reads @xmath290 which we also write as @xmath291    our next proposition shows that fuzzification between two sharp observables can only be of the non - blurring form .",
    "this result follows immediately by combining propositions 1 and 2 in @xcite even in the more general case in which @xmath197 is an observable ( not necessarily sharp ) . in this general form",

    "namely , if @xmath320 is the projection on the @xmath321-th factor , then @xmath322 .",
    "this observation leads to a natural generalization of joint measurability .",
