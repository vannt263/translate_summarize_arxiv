    "shear viscosity plays important roles in neutron star physics . it might damp the r - mode instability below the temperature @xmath1 k @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of shear viscosity is essential in understanding pulsar glitches and free precession of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the neutron shear viscosity ( @xmath2 ) for nonsuperfluid matter using free - space nucleon - nucleon scattering data was first done by flowers and itoh @xcite .",
    "cutler and lindblom @xcite fitted the results of flowers and itoh @xcite for the study of viscous damping of oscillations in neutron stars .",
    "recently the neutron shear viscosity of pure neutron matter has been investigated in a self - consistent way @xcite .",
    "it was noted that electrons , the lightest charged particles and neutrons , the most abundant particles in neutron star matter contribute significantly to the total shear viscosity .",
    "flowers and itoh found that the neutron viscosity was larger than the combined viscosity of electrons and muons ( @xmath3 ) in non - superfluid matter @xcite . further cutler and lindblom argued that the electron viscosity was larger than the neutron viscosity in a superfluid neutron star @xcite .",
    "later andersson and his collaborators as well as yakovlev and his collaborator showed @xmath4 in the presence of proton superfluidity @xcite . in the latter calculation , the effects of the exchange of transverse plasmons in the collisions of charged particles were included and it lowered the @xmath3 compared with the case when only longitudinal plasmons were considered @xcite .",
    "so far , all of those calculations of shear viscosity were done in neutron star matter composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons .",
    "however , exotic forms of matter such as hyperon or antikaon condensed matter might appear in the interior of neutron stars . negatively charged hyperons or a @xmath0 condensate could affect the electron shear viscosity appreciably .    here",
    "we focus on the role of @xmath0 meson condensates on the shear viscosity .",
    "no calculation of shear viscosity involving antikaon condensation has been carried out so far .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the shear viscosity in the presence of an antikaon condensate .",
    "the @xmath0 condensate appears at 2 - 3 times the normal nuclear matter density . with the onset of the condensate ,",
    "@xmath0 mesons replace electrons and muons in the core . as a result ,",

    "it was noted that the proton fraction became comparable to the neutron fraction in a neutron star including the @xmath0 condensate at higher densities @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath0 condensate would not only influence the electron and muon shear viscosities but it will also give rise to a new contribution called the proton shear viscosity .",

    "here we are interested in calculating the shear viscosity of neutron star matter in the presence of an antikaon condensate .",
    "we consider neutron star matter undergoing a first order phase transition from charge neutral and beta - equilibrated nuclear matter to a @xmath0 condensed phase . the nuclear phase is composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons whereas the antikaon condensed phase is made up of neutrons and protons embedded in the bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0 mesons along with electrons and muons .",
    "antikaons form a s - wave ( @xmath5 ) condensation in this case . therefore",
    ", @xmath0 mesons in the condensate do not take part in momentum transfer during collisions with other particles .",
    "however , the condensate influences the proton fraction and equation of state ( eos ) which , in turn , might have important consequences for the shear viscosity .",
    "the starting point for the calculation of the shear viscosity is a set of coupled boltzmann transport equations @xcite for the ith particle species ( i= n , p , e , @xmath6 ) with velocity @xmath7 and distribution function @xmath8 ,    @xmath9    the transport equations are coupled through collision integrals given by , @xmath10 where @xmath11~.\\ ] ] here @xmath12 , @xmath13 are momenta of incident particles and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are those of final states . the kronecker delta in eq .

    "spins are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the differential transition rate .",
    "the nonequilibrium distribution function for the i - th species @xmath8 is given by @xmath18 where the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath19 and the departure from the equilibrium is given by @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the following ansatz for @xmath21 @xcite    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the effective relaxation time for the ith species and @xmath24 is the flow velocity .",
    "the transport equations are linearised and multiplied by @xmath25 .",

    "the differential transition rate for the proton - proton scattering is the sum of electromagnetic and strong contributions .",
    "this was discussed earlier in ref.@xcite .",

    "it is to be noted here that @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath84 are the new results of this calculation .",
    "as soon as we know the collision frequencies of nucleon - nucleon scatterings due to the strong interaction , we can immediately calculate effective relaxation times of neutrons and protons from eq .",
    "this leads to the calculation of the neutron and proton shear viscosities as @xmath88 finally the total shear viscosity is given by @xmath89    the eos enters into the calculation of the shear viscosity as an input .",
    "we construct the eos within the framework of the relativistic field theoretical model @xcite . here",
    "we consider a first order phase transition from nuclear matter to @xmath0 condensed matter .",
    "we adopt the maxwell construction for the first order phase transition .",
    "the constituents of matter are neutrons , protons , electrons and muons in both phases and also ( anti)kaons in the @xmath0 condensed phase .",
    "both phases maintain charge neutrality and @xmath90 equilibrium conditions .",

    "recently , the double pole structure of @xmath115 was investigated in connection with the antikaon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "further , the highly attractive potential depth of several hundred mev was obtained in the calculation of deeply bound antikaon - nuclear states @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation to the deeply bound antikaon - nuclear states was given by others @xcite .",

    "we obtain kaon - scalar meson coupling constant @xmath117 corresponding to @xmath118 mev .    the composition of neutron star matter including the @xmath0 condensate as a function of normalised baryon density is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the @xmath0 condensation sets in at 2.43@xmath119 . before the onset of the condensation ,",
    "all particle fractions increase with baryon density . in this case , the charge neutrality is maintained by protons , electrons and muons .",
    "as soon as the antikaon condensate is formed , the density of @xmath0 mesons in the condensate rapidly increases and @xmath0 mesons replace leptons in the system .",
    "the proton density eventually becomes equal to the @xmath0 density .",
    "the proton density in the presence of the condensate increases significantly and may be higher than the neutron density at higher baryon densities @xcite .",
    "this increase in the proton fraction in the presence of the @xmath0 condensate might result in an enhancement in the proton shear viscosity and appreciable reduction in the electron and muon viscosities compared with the case without the condensate .",
    "we discuss this in details in the following paragraphs .",
    "next we focus on the calculation of @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for the scatterings via the electromagnetic interaction , we calculate those quantities using eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) . on the other hand , @xmath123s corresponding to collisions through the strong interaction are estimated using eqs .",
    "( 22)-(25 ) . in an earlier calculation , the authors considered only @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xcite for the calculation of the neutron shear viscosity in nucleons - only neutron star matter because protons were treated as passive scatterers .",
    "it follows from the discussion in the preceding paragraph that protons can no longer be treated as passive scatterers because of the large proton fraction in the presence of the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "consequently the contributions of @xmath86 and @xmath87 have to be taken into account in the calculation of the proton and neutron shear viscosities .",

    "the values of @xmath126 ranges from 1.3 to 2.03 @xmath128 whereas that of @xmath127 spans the interval 0.35 to 1.73 @xmath128 .",

    "it is noted that the effect of the condensate on @xmath124 is not significant .",
    "figure 3 shows that @xmath86 drops sharply with increasing baryon density and crosses the curve of @xmath87 in the absence of the condensate .",
    "however @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not influenced by the antikaon condensate . a comparison of fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 reveals that @xmath86 is almost one order of magnitude larger than @xmath124 at lower baryon densities .",
    "this may be attributed to the smaller proton fermi momentum .",
    "we also compute @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( not shown here ) and these quantities have negative values .",
    "further we find that the magnitude of @xmath131 is higher than that of @xmath130 .",
    "it is to be noted here that @xmath84 is related to @xmath132 by eq .",

    "it is evident from fig .",
    "4 that the total shear viscosity in our calculation is significantly higher than other cases . this may be attributed to the fact that our eos is a fully relativistic one .",
    "we exhibit shear viscosities in the presence of an antikaon condensate as a function of baryon density in fig .",
    "this calculation is performed at a temperature @xmath133k . in the absence of the @xmath0 condensate ,",

    "the electron , muon and neutron shear viscosities exceed the proton shear viscosity by several orders of magnitude .",
    "further we note that the lepton viscosities are greater than the neutron viscosity . on the other hand , we find interesting results in the presence of the antikaon condensate .",
    "the electron and muon shear viscosities decrease very fast after the onset of @xmath0 condensation whereas the proton shear viscosity rises in this case .",
    "there is almost no change in the neutron shear viscosity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the proton shear viscosity in the presence of the condensate approaches the value of the neutron shear viscosity as baryon density increases .",
    "the total shear viscosity decreases in the @xmath0 condensed matter due to the sharp drop in the lepton shear viscosities . here",
    "the variation of shear viscosities with baryon density is shown up to 3@xmath119 .",
    "the neutron and proton shear viscosities in neutron star matter with the @xmath0 condensate might dominate over the electron and muon shear viscosities beyond baryon density 3@xmath119 .",
    "consequently , the total shear viscosity would again increase .",
    "the temperature dependence of the total shear viscosity is shown in fig .",
    "6 . in an earlier calculation ,",
    "electron and muon shear viscosities were determined by collisions only due to the exchange of transverse plasmons because this was the dominant contribution @xcite . under this approximation , the electron and muon shear viscosities had a temperature dependence of @xmath135 , whereas , the neutron shear viscosity was proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electron and muon shear viscosities deviated from the standard temperature dependence of the shear viscosity of neutron fermi liquid .",
    "however , in this calculation we have not made any such approximation .",
    "we have considered all the components of effective collision frequency which have different temperature dependence as given by eq .",
    "this gives rise to a complicated temperature dependence in the calculation of shear viscosity .",
    "the total shear viscosity is plotted for @xmath137 , @xmath133 , and @xmath138 k in fig .",
    "it is noted that the shear viscosity increases as temperature decreases .",
    "the shear viscosity plays an important role in damping the r - mode instability in old and accreting neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the instability is achieved by the competition of various time scales associated with gravitational radiation ( @xmath139 ) , hyperon bulk viscosity ( @xmath140 ) , modified urca bulk viscosity ( @xmath141 ) , and shear viscosity ( @xmath142 ) . at high temperatures",
    "the bulk viscosity damp the r - mode instability .",
    "as neutron stars cool down , the bulk viscosity might not be the dominant damping mechanism .",
    "the shear viscosity becomes significant in the temperature regime @xmath143k and might suppress the r - mode instability effectively .    in this calculation , we consider only the antikaon optical potential depth @xmath116 mev .",
    "however , this calculation could be performed for other values of antikaon optical potential depths . as the magnitude of the @xmath0 potential depth decreases ,",
    "the threshold of the antikaon condensation is shifted to higher densities @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", hyperons may also appear in neutron star matter around 2 - 3@xmath119 .",
    "negatively charged hyperons might delay the onset of @xmath0 condensation @xcite .",
    "however , it was noted in an earlier calculation that @xmath144 hyperons were excluded from the system because of repulsive @xmath145-nuclear matter interaction and @xmath146 hyperons might appear at very high baryon density @xcite .",
    "however , the appearance of @xmath147 hyperons could compete with the threshold of @xmath0 condensation .",
    "if @xmath147 hyperons appear before @xmath0 condensation , the threshold of @xmath0 condensation is shifted to higher baryon density because of softening in the equation of state due to @xmath147 hyperons .",
    "but the qualitative results of the shear viscosity discussed above remain the same .",
    "we have investigated the shear viscosity in the presence of a @xmath0 condensate . with the onset of @xmath0 condensation ,",
    "electrons and muons are replaced by @xmath0 mesons rapidly .",
    "the proton fraction also increases and eventually becomes equal to the neutron fraction in the @xmath0 condensed neutron star matter .",
    "this has important consequences for the electron , muon and proton shear viscosities .",
    "we have found that the electron and muon shear viscosities drop steeply after the formation of the @xmath0 condensate in neutron stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton shear viscosity whose contribution to the total shear viscosity was negligible in earlier calculations @xcite , now becomes significant in the presence of the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "the proton shear viscosity would exceed the neutron as well as lepton shear viscosities beyond 3@xmath119 .",
    "the total viscosity would be dominated by the proton and neutron shear viscosities in this case .",
    "this calculation may be extended to neutron stars with strong magnetic fields .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that we adopt the maxwell construction for the first order phase transition in this calculation .",
    "such a construction is justified if the surface tension between two phases is quite large @xcite .",
    "moreover the value of the surface tension between the nuclear and antikaon condensed phases or between the hadron and quark phases is not known correctly .",
    "therefore , this problem could also be studied using the gibbs construction @xcite .",
    "besides the role of shear viscosity in damping the r - mode instability as well as in pulsar glitches and free precession of neutron stars , it has an important contribution in the nucleation rate of bubbles in first order phase transitions .",
    "it was shown earlier that the shear viscosity might control the initial growth rate of a bubble @xcite .",

    "<S> consequently the shear viscosity due to scatterings of electrons and muons with themselves and protons is lowered compared to the case without the condensate . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of proton - proton collisions to the proton shear viscosity through electromagnetic and strong interactions , becomes important and comparable to the neutron shear viscosity . </S>"
