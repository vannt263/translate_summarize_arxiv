    "the predicted burst gravitational waves have a some peculiar characteristics : type i ) big narrow spike of @xmath21 msec and following 10 - 15 msec decay ringing , type ii ) a few msec spikes iterate a few times with @xmath210 msec interval , type iii ) broad excess of @xmath25 msec with fine structure of @xmath21 msec .",
    "the predicted burst gravitational waves have a duration and tail of signals .",
    "since the tail structure and frequency spread is not same as popular spike noises which caused by the detector instruments , it will be possible to differentiate the gravitational waves from noises .",
    "however , it is hard to predict the gravitational wave forms in analytically or hard to fit with a few parameters .    to identify such a signal ,",
    "we have developed a new method by examining clustering of signal powers in time - frequency domain@xcite .",

    "gravitational waves from stellar - core collapse of supernovae , or quasi - normal mode oscillation of black holes , has the typical time scale 10@xmath2100 msec .",
    "it corresponds to the good sensitive observation band 100hz@xmath21khz of ground - based gravitational wave detectors as tama300 .",

    "we dispose these sffts in time order , which is called sonogram in time - frequency domain .",
    "one bin of data of time - frequency domain is displayed as pixel. each pixel represents the signal power at a given time and a frequency .",
