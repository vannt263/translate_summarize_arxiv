    "the photon collider option of a linear collider ( lc ) is based on laser photon back - scattering on high energy electrons .",
    "the maximum photon energy is 205  gev for a laser with @xmath0 and an electron beam energy of 250  gev .",
    "a high degree of polarisation with opposite helicities of the electron and the laser photon is crucial for obtaining a peaked spectrum of high energy polarised photons close to the maximum energy . in this case",
    "the high energy part of the @xmath1 spectrum is dominated by the spin-0 configuration which is important to enhance the signal and suppress the background for higgs production",
    ". alternatively , e@xmath2 interactions are also possible .",
    "the technical aspects of the photon collider are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "neutral higgs bosons are produced in the scattering of two photons as a @xmath3-channel resonance through a loop . in this loop",
    "all charged particles contribute which obtain their mass from electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the two - photon partial width of the higgs boson is therefore sensitive to physics beyond the sm .    for higgs bosons decaying predominantly into @xmath4 , the main source of background",
    "are @xmath5 processes ( q = c , b ) .",
    "the spin-0 component of these processes is suppressed in leading order ( lo ) by a factor @xmath6 . since",
    "this suppression is only valid in lo , a realistic background simulation should be based on a next - to - leading ( nlo ) calculation .",
    "several analyses of @xmath7 decays for a sm higgs boson in the mass range from 120 gev to 160 gev have been performed  @xcite .",
    "all analyses exploit the kinematic differences between the @xmath3-channel signal and the @xmath8-channel background by cutting on visible energy and angular distributions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - wcorr ] .",
    "[ fig1 ]    before b - tagging the ratio of background from @xmath9 events to @xmath10 events is approximately 16 due to the quark charges .",
    "excellent b - tagging is therefore required to suppress the charm background .",
    "the need to minimize the radius of the beam pipe is one of the main challenges for a photon collider , since the beam pipe has to accomodate the optical system for producing back - scattered photons .",
    "the analyses presented here have assumed that @xmath4 events are tagged with @xmath11 efficiency and @xmath12 events with @xmath13 efficiency . for a luminosity corresponding to roughly one year of running , a statistical uncertainty of about @xmath14 for a higgs mass of 120 - 140  gev for the two photon width measurement",
    "can be achieved .",
    "the uncertainty increases to about @xmath15 for a higgs mass of 160  gev .    at higgs boson masses above 160",
    "gev decays into ww and zz pairs become important . in this case",
    "the interference between signal and @xmath16 background needs to be taken into account .",
    "the interference gives access to an additional observable , the phase @xmath17 of the @xmath18 amplitude .",
    "the combined precision of phase and partial width determination gives sufficient precision to distinguish the sm from sm - like 2hdm ( ii ) scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the results of a detector simulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ww ] .",
    "the neutral mssm higgs boson h , a for masses above 200  gev and for moderate @xmath19 might escape detection at the lhc . in this parameter region , where decays into @xmath4",
    "are the dominant sm decays up to higgs masses around 550 gev , the photon collider can discover the neutral mssm higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath20 option of the lc , the photon collider can produce these higgs boson with masses up to about @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "cross - sections for signal and background are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - mm ] .",
    "many other higgs scenarios have been studied for the photon collider option , adding to the discovery potential : for example , the measurement of cp properties of the higgs bosons a , h in @xmath23 decays  @xcite or the production of charged higgs bosons in the process @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "one of many other interesting topics which can be studied at a @xmath1 or at an e@xmath2 collider are non - commutative quantum field theories ( ncqft ) with non - commuting ( nc ) space - time operators  @xcite .",
    "the additional cubic coupling ( @xmath25 ) contributing to the process @xmath26 is shown in fig .",

    "a transverse momentum greater than 10  gev and a polar angle in the range @xmath33 has been required for the final state particles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - don ] the ncqft effects on the angular distributions of the final state photons in @xmath30 scattering are shown .",
