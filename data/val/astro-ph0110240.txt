    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary filling the roche lobe .",
    "the matter transferred from the secondary forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf .",
    "instabilities in the accretion disk result in various kinds of activities seen in cvs .",
    "the two most relevant instabilities are thermal and tidal instabilities , which are responsible for dwarf nova - type outbursts and superhumps , respectively ( see @xcite for a review ) . in systems having orbital periods longer than three hours , thermal instability governs the general behavior .",
    "accretion disks become thermally stable at high mass - transfer rates ( @xmath0 ) , while disks becomes thermally unstable in low @xmath0 .",
    "the former corresponds to novalike ( nl ) variables , which do not show outbursts , while the latter corresponds to dwarf novae , which show semi - periodic outbursts .",
    "close to the thermal stability border , there exist systems called as z cam stars , which show both standstills , the state corresponding to a nl variable , and a state exhibiting dwarf nova outbursts . the origin of interchanging states in z cam stars can be naturally understood with an assumption of varying @xmath0 from the secondary : the high @xmath0-state corresponds to standstills , while the low @xmath0-state the dwarf nova phase .",
    "there exist a small group of nl variables which show temporary reduction or cessation of @xmath0 from the secondary , namely vy scl - type stars @xcite .",
    "the low states ( reduced @xmath0-states ) of vy scl stars are hard to interpret in the scheme of the standard disk instability theory .",
    "if the disk follows the same evolution as in z cam stars in response to the temporary reduction of @xmath0 , the system should undergo dwarf nova outbursts ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "observations usually show the contrary : the system undergoes a smooth decline from the high to low states ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    an important clue to understanding",
    "the vy scl - type behavior came from the detection of transient supersoft x - rays from a vy scl - type system , v751 cyg @xcite . from the detection of supersoft x - rays during the low state of v751 cyg , @xcite suggested that steady nuclear burning is taking place on the white dwarf of v751 cyg . @xcite",
    "further suggested the possibility that vy scl - type stars comprise a low - mass analog of supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxs ) .",
    "this discovery is consistent with the observed high temperature of white dwarfs in vy scl - type systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite , table 2.8 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that , in the presence of the heating from the hot white dwarf , the irradiation on the accretion disk suppresses the thermal instability , which can reproduce the observed light curve of vy scl - type system in their low - high transitions .",
    "this effect , combined with the suggestion by @xcite , would be a promising candidate for the explanation of the behavior of vy scl - type stars . in this paper , we report on the discovery of large - amplitude oscillations with a period of 2.65 d , in a vy scl - type system v425 cas @xcite , which we regard as a further evidence for the effect of irradiation .",
    "a fading of v425 cas was detected by one of authors ( t. kinnunen ) in 1997 august .",
    "the object soon returned to its high state , and remained at around mag 14.5 until early 1998 .",
    "the object was again caught in faint state at the beginning of the next observing season ( 1998 august ) .",
    "we observed the system with a ccd in three seasons , 1998  early 1999 , late 1999  early 2000 and early 2000 .",
    "the ccd observations were done using an unfiltered st-7 camera attached to the meade 25-cm schmidt - cassegrain telescope .",
    "the exposure time was 30 s. the images were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and analyzed using the java@xmath1-based psf photometry package developed by one of the authors ( t. kato ) .",

    "we have searched signals around the orbital period of v425 cas ( 0.1496 d , @xcite ) and found no significant period representing the overall light variation .",
    "this strongly indicates that the variation is not related to its orbital motion . the low inclination angle ( 25@xmath7 , @xcite )",

    "the object had further faded by @xmath81.0 mag at the beginning of this season .",
    "there is an evidence of a further fade in 2000 november  december .",
    "it is likely the object was entering a deep low state during this season .",
    "the large amplitude ( up to 1.5 mag , and 0.60.7 mag in average , which is close to a factor of two flux variation ) of the variations far exceeds those of known ( local ) disk oscillations , such as quasi - periodic oscillations , in cvs .",
    "the amplitude more suggests that dwarf nova - type disk instability is taking place , which is also consistent with the observed profile of variation .",
    "the main difference from the ordinary dwarf novae is the extreme shortness of the recurrent time .",
    "dwarf novae with orbital periods around that of v425 cas have typical recurrence time of ten to a hundred of days , the shortest known one being am cas having a recurrent time as short as 8 d ( cf .",
    "the recurrence time of dwarf novae is basically governed by the two factors , namely the viscous drift time in low @xmath0 systems and the build - up time in the outer disk torus in high @xmath0 systems ( cf .",
    "the shortest limit of recurrence time is regulated by the latter factor , which makes the recurrence time approximately inversely proportional to @xmath0 . above the critical @xmath0 ,",
    "the disk becomes thermally stable , and this determines the shortest limit . according to calculations by @xcite , the expected minimum period is slightly below @xmath810 d , which is in good agreement with the am cas case .",
    "a different mechanism is therefore needed to explain the extremely short recurrent time in v425 cas .    a clue to this problem",
    "can be found in another example of a striking departure of recurrence time from the disk - instability theory : ",
    "purr \" type outbursts observed during the outburst of an x - ray transient , v518 per = gro j0422 + 32 @xcite , which had a recurrence time of @xmath810 d , which is several times to an order of magnitude shorter than the expected recurrence time from the disk instability model .",
    "@xcite argued that x - ray irradiation on the accretion disk can effectively increase the disk temperature , and suppress the instability in inner portions of the disk , producing small - scale purr - type outbursts ( for model calculations , see @xcite ) .",
    "this scheme could apply to accretion disks in cvs , if there is an appropriate source of irradiation .",
    "@xcite required an x - ray luminosity of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 in producing purr - type outbursts .",
    "since the observed x - ray luminosity during a low state of the vy scl - type star v751 cyg was estimated to be @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 @xcite , the effect of irradiation in vy scl - type systems is expected to be enough to produce similar purr - type outbursts in cvs ( cvs generally have smaller accretion disks than in x - ray transients , which would make even a lower @xmath12 to work equally efficiently ) .",
    "we thus regard the present discovery of dwarf nova - like oscillations in v425 cas as another promising evidence for the effect of irradiation in vy scl - type systems .",
    "the disappearance of this kind of oscillations in the 19992000 season may be explained , in the same context , by the reduction of irradiation , due to the exhaustion of the accreted matter after a long - lasting of low - accretion state .",
    "the termination of accretion or the exhaustion of the accreted matter probably led to a further fade observed within the following eight months .",
    "yet another intriguing similarity is found in dwarf nova - like oscillations in helium cvs ( am cvn stars ) .",
    "two examples are known : cr boo ( @xmath1319 hr , @xcite ) and v803 cen ( @xmath142023 hr , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that this oscillation in cr boo can be understood as an extension of outbursts in hydrogen - rich dwarf novae , using the known relations ( kukarkin - parenago s relation and bailey s relation ) in hydrogen - rich dwarf novae .",
    "however , the assessment of the period should require calculations in helium accretion disks .",
    "@xcite applied the dwarf nova - type thermal and tidal instability model to the helium disk systems , and obtained a recurrence time of @xmath848 d , which is too long to explain the observed oscillations in cr boo and v803 cen .",
    "this recurrence time was more appropriately demonstrated in  normal outbursts \" of cr boo @xcite between its superoutbursts recurring with a period of 46 d. @xcite suggested that lower - amplitude , short - period oscillations observed by @xcite may result from the reflection of the cooling and heating waves in the outer region of the accretion disk , and not the full - disk outburst .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this effect was not clear at the time of the suggestion by @xcite , but the relatively strong x - ray flux in both stars inferred from rosat observations , the effect of x - ray irradiation would be a promising explanation . emerging evidences on the observable effect of irradiation in cvs on their outburst behavior , as demonstrated in the present observation , may be also a key to understanding the mystery of outbursts in helium cvs .",
    "our long - term ccd photometry of v425 cas , during its faint state in 19982000 , revealed the presence of totally unexpected , unprecedented large - amplitude ( 0.51.5 mag ) oscillations with a time scale of a few days .",
    "the period analysis of oscillations has demonstrated that this oscillation is well represented by a single period of 2.65 d. the amplitude and mean profile of variation strongly suggests that variation is caused by dwarf nova - type disk instability .",
    "the shortness of the period is more difficult to explain . by taking recent discoveries of supersoft x - rays in a low state vy scl - type star into account , we proposed that the suppression of the thermal instability of the inner accretion disk by irradiation can be responsible for this large - amplitude variation in v425 cas .",
    "this effect of irradiation may also apply to helium cataclysmic variables , which show similar short - period , large - amplitude oscillations , which were proposed to be dwarf nova - type outbursts .",
