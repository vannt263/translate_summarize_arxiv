    "there are different kinds of risk in a stock portfolio , for example , a systematic one due to the general trends in the economy affecting the entire market , and an unsystematic one due to events affecting only segments of the whole market under consideration , such as the companies within the same industrial branch or in one country  @xcite .",

    "the identification of branches through stock correlations was also studied by mantegna  @xcite .    here , we present a new approach to identify and estimate the noise and , thereby , also the strength of the true correlations . as we do not use the large eigenvalues outside the bulk of the spectral density ,",

    "most models for time series @xmath0 of stocks  @xcite have a random component , involving a random number @xmath1 and a volatility constant @xmath2 , and a non  random component , the drift part , involving a drift constant @xmath3 .",
    "geometric brownian motion @xmath4 is particularly popular . the dimensionless quantity @xmath5 is referred to as return . due to",
    "the central limit theorem , geometric brownian motion leads , largely independently of the distribution for the random numbers @xmath1 , to a log  normal distribution of the stock prices .",
    "this is in fair agreement with the empirical distributions for price changes about one day and greater  @xcite .",
    "the tails of the empirical distributions are , in general , much fatter  @xcite . to describe this , one uses , for example , autoregressive processes which take into account that the volatility is also a fluctuating quantity , see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present context of correlations , however , it suffices to model the time series in the spirit of geometric brownian motion . in economics",
    ", one wishes to measure the correlations independent of the drift .",
    "thus , one usually takes the logarithms or the logarithmic differences of the time series to remove the exponential trend in the data due to the drift . moreover , one normalizes the data to zero mean value and unit variance .    in view of these requirements ,",
    "noh  @xcite suggested a proper model to study financial correlations . from an economics viewpoint , it is of the one  factor type and can be interpreted as an application of the arbitrage pricing model due to ross  @xcite , see also the discussion in  [ app0 ] . from a physics viewpoint , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , noh s model has much in common with certain models involving interacting potts spins  @xcite . consider a market involving @xmath6 companies , labeled @xmath7 , and @xmath8 industrial branches , labeled @xmath9 .",
    "the companies within the same industrial branch are assumed to be correlated .",
    "the companies are ordered in such a way that the indices @xmath10 of companies within the same branch follow each other .",
    "for example , we have @xmath11 companies and @xmath12 branches and we assume that the first branch with @xmath13 consists of the first @xmath14 companies , the second branch with @xmath15 consists of the next @xmath16 companies , the third branch with @xmath17 consists of the next @xmath18 companies , and , finally , we assume that the remaining @xmath19 companies are in no branch .",
    "the branch index @xmath20 is viewed as a function of the company index @xmath10 , i.e.  we have @xmath21 . for the @xmath22 companies which are not in any branch , we set @xmath23 .",

    "the normalized time series @xmath27 of the returns for the @xmath6 companies are modeled as the sum of two purely random contributions : the first one models the correlations within a given branch and is thus common to this branch , involving random numbers @xmath28 , the second one is specific for the company and involves random numbers @xmath29 , @xmath30 the two contributions are weighted with a parameter @xmath31 , common to all companies in the branch @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath32 and the @xmath29 are uncorrelated and standard normal distributed with zero mean value .",

    "the correlation coefficient between two companies labeled @xmath10 and @xmath49 is the average over the product of the two normalized time series , @xmath50 if one views the numbers @xmath37 as the entries of a @xmath51 rectangular matrix @xmath52 , one has @xmath53 for the @xmath54 correlation matrix @xmath55 . as these averages depend on the length @xmath38 of the time series , we add the argument @xmath38 to the correlation matrix . within our model",

    "some issues related to the normalization of correlation matrices are discussed in  [ app0 ] .",
    "if the time series have only a finite length , @xmath61 , it is obvious that the averages @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 give neither zero nor unity , but some finite numbers .",
    "this describes the noise dressing of financial correlation matrices which was found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of noh s model . due to the finiteness of the time series ,",
    "there is a purely random offset to every correlation coefficient , burying the true correlation coefficient which would be found if the time series were sufficiently long .",
    "as we aim at a analytical discussion later on , we formulate the noise dressing more quantitatively .",
    "we employ a standard result of mathematical statistics  @xcite : consider two time series of uncorrelated random numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 with standard normal distributions and zero mean value .",
    "the average @xmath67 is a random number , following a gauss distribution centered at mean value unity with variance @xmath68 , if @xmath69 , and following a gauss distribution centered at mean value zero with variance @xmath70 , if @xmath71 .",
    "hence , we can write this average to leading order in @xmath38 as @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are uncorrelated random numbers , independent of @xmath38 , with standard normal distribution and zero mean value . this yields for the correlation coefficients the expression @xmath74 to leading order in @xmath38 .",
    "the first two terms stem from the averages @xmath62 and @xmath64 , the last two from the interference averages @xmath75 .",

    "these sets are understood to be different from each other . to avoid a cumbersome notation , we do not add further indices to specify that .",

    "as the number of companies in the analysis  @xcite of real market data is several hundreds , we choose this number as @xmath81 for our simulation .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath82 industrial branches whose sizes @xmath24 and weights @xmath83 are listed in table  [ tab_nohp2 ] .",
    "since noh  @xcite showed that the choice @xmath84 leads to spectral densities which are in agreement with the empirical data  @xcite , we use the same parameterization here .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath85 companies which are not in any branch .",
    "we simulate the correlation matrices @xmath86 for four",
    "different lengths @xmath87 of the time series , calculate the eigenvalues @xmath88 and work out the spectral densities @xmath89 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig_cevl_t ] .",
    "as already observed by noh  @xcite , the first density @xmath90 for the shortest time series with @xmath91 resembles very much the densities of the empirical correlation matrices found in refs .",
    "there is a bulk    c|cccccc @xmath20 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 + @xmath92 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 128 + @xmath83 & 0.75 & 0.88 & 0.94 & 0.97 & 0.98 & 0.99 +    spectrum in the interval @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , a number of isolated peaks in the interval @xmath94 is seen .",
    "each of these large eigenvalues corresponds to an individual industrial branch . for increasing lengths @xmath38 ,",
    "the isolated peaks are stable , but the bulk spectrum separates into two groups of eigenvalues .",
    "the left group is roughly centered around @xmath95 , the right one around @xmath96 .",
    "we will see in the analytical discussion to be performed in sec .",

    "we also write @xmath106 for the eigenvalues and @xmath107 for the eigenvectors .",
    "one quickly finds @xmath108 . since the elements of every @xmath109 are numbers depending on the weights @xmath83 and the sizes @xmath24 , every coefficient @xmath110 is , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) , a linear combination of the standard normal distributed random numbers @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath73 .",
    "hence , it is itself a gaussian distributed random number @xmath111 with zero mean value and a variance @xmath112 which is some function of the @xmath83 and the @xmath24 .",
    "we arrive at @xmath113 for @xmath7 to leading order in @xmath38 .",
    "we notice that , in this expansion to order @xmath114 , the gaussian random variables @xmath111 are uncorrelated .",
    "the effect of the smearing out , i.e.  of the noise in the model , is marginal for the @xmath8 numerically large eigenvalues @xmath115 .",
    "their positions change the less , the larger the size @xmath24 .",
    "the effect of the noise is much stronger on the numerically smaller eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , their degeneracies are lifted and distributions develop around their mean values . for the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath116 which belong to the @xmath8 industrial branches and , hence , describe true correlations , the mean value is @xmath117 while it simply reads @xmath118 for the eigenvalues which are unity and which were generated by the time series not belonging to any branch .",
    "as the weights satisfy @xmath119 if @xmath9 , we always have @xmath120 this important relation implies that the centers of the distributions generated by the noise from the two set of degenerate eigenvalues are always different from each other .",

    ", we argue phenomenologically . some further analytical properties",
    "are compiled in  [ appa ] .",
    "we first replace the first term of eq .",

    "we notice that , analogous to @xmath127 , there would be in principle a scale @xmath136 entering the density @xmath137 .",
    "it would result from a proper average of those numbers @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3.2 ] ) which do not stem from the industrial branches .",
    "however , since we start out from normalized time series and since the weights @xmath83 do not contribute here , we expect @xmath138 . the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.1 ] ) we leave unchanged , because we can ignore the shift in the positions of these largest eigenvalues . thus ,",
    "collecting everything , we find @xmath139 as the functions @xmath140 and @xmath137 are normalized to unity , the noisy density @xmath89 is correctly normalized to the total number @xmath6 of eigenvalues .",
    "we expect the formula  ( [ eq3.11 ] ) to work particularly well for large @xmath38 . in figure  [ fig_cevl3dp_t ]",
    "we fit it to the bulk part of the spectral density @xmath141 for @xmath142 which was presented in figure  [ fig_cevl_t ] .",
    "the agreement is very good , the fit yields @xmath143 .",
    "in sec .  [ sec4.1 ] , we introduce the power mapping and discuss its properties numerically .",
    "we give a qualitative analytical explanation in sec .",

    "[ sec4.3 ] , we demonstrate how the power mapping can detect different correlation structures .",
    "finally , we define a measure for the noise in sec .",
    "[ sec4.4 ] .",
    "the true correlations buried under the noise become visible in the spectral density if the time series are long enough . thus ,",
    "if we found a procedure that is equivalent , in some sense , to a prolongation of the time series , we would be able to identify and quantify the noise in a given correlation matrix . in the sequel",
    ", we develop such a procedure , the power mapping .",
    "we map the correlation matrix @xmath86 to the matrix @xmath144 . here , @xmath145 is a positive number and the elements of @xmath144 are calculated according to the definition @xmath146 thus , the mapping preserves the sign of the matrix element @xmath147 and raises the modulus of it to the @xmath145th power .",
    "we notice that @xmath144 is the matrix of the powers of the elements of @xmath86 , but not the power of the matrix @xmath86 .",
    "this is crucial , because the spectra of @xmath86 and @xmath148 are , for @xmath149 , related in a simple way : if @xmath88 are the eigenvalues of @xmath86 , @xmath150 are the eigenvalues of @xmath148 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath144 is much more complicated and depends on the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath86 .",

    "we do so to make possible a comparison with figure  [ fig_cevl_t ] , where the impact of increasing length for the time series was studied , starting from a correlation matrix with the same sizes and weights and for the same length @xmath91 . to improve the statistical significance and to better illustrate the effect of the power mapping , we simulate an ensemble of 25 such correlation matrices from time series of length @xmath151 .",
    "we choose powers @xmath152 and calculate , for a fixed @xmath145 , the 25 power mapped matrices @xmath144 from the 25 matrices @xmath86 of the ensemble .",
    "then , the individual spectra are evaluated and the density @xmath153 results as the ensemble average .",
    "all densities are shown in figure  [ fig_evanp_t ] .",
    "the power mapping transforms the original density @xmath154 for @xmath155 into densities @xmath153 which show for intermediate values of @xmath145 two clearly separated peaks .",
    "the best separation is obtained near @xmath156 . for values beyond @xmath157",
    ", the two peaks glue together again , and the separation is lost . what do these two peaks in the densities @xmath153 for @xmath158 represent ? ",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig_cevl_t ] shows that , indeed , the left peak in figure  [ fig_evanp_t ] corresponds to the one for the true correlations in figure  [ fig_cevl_t ] , while the right peak in figure  [ fig_evanp_t ] corresponds to the one for the noise around the trivial self ",
    "correlation of the companies for @xmath69 in figure  [ fig_cevl_t ] .",

    "are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) . to understand the effect of the power mapping , we distinguish three different cases in considering @xmath159 .",
    "first , we power map the diagonal elements @xmath160 . as eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) shows , the vast majority of them matrix elements will be positive if @xmath38 is sufficiently large . thus , to simplify the discussion , we ignore the absolute value sign . to leading order in @xmath38 , we have @xmath161 second , we power map the off  diagonal elements @xmath147 in the blocks of the industrial branches where @xmath71 but @xmath162 . for the same reason as in the previous case , we ignore the absolute value sign , and find @xmath163 to leading order in @xmath38 .",
    "third , we power map the elements @xmath147 outside the blocks , where @xmath71 and @xmath164 . since all kronecker @xmath165 s in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) are zero in this case , we obtain @xmath166 as the leading order in @xmath38 .",
    "we notice that the matrix elements @xmath147 in this third case will be positive or negative with equal probability .    in the first two cases  ( [ eq4.11 ] ) and  ( [ eq4.12 ] )",
    ", the powers @xmath167 contain a @xmath38 independent term plus a term which is of order @xmath114 . in the third case",
    ", however , there is no @xmath38 independent term , and the leading order of the whole expression is @xmath168 .",
    "thus , for @xmath169 , @xmath159 vanishes faster in the third case than in the first two terms . as the case  ( [ eq4.13 ] )     +   +     +   +     +   +     +    comprises all elements outside the blocks , where @xmath71 and @xmath170 , we find that , for @xmath169 , the power mapped matrix @xmath144 is block diagonal to leading order @xmath114 .",
    "this explains why the power mapping has an effect which is comparable to a prolongation of the time series . at first sight",
    ", one would expect that the effect is the stronger , the larger the value of @xmath145 . however , this is not so , because the @xmath38 independent terms are different for the matrix elements in the blocks : in the first case  ( [ eq4.11 ] ) of the diagonal elements , it is unity , but a number smaller than unity in the second case  ( [ eq4.12 ] ) .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath145 , the smaller becomes the latter term .",
    "hence , the unity in the diagonal elements dominates more and more , driving the eigenvalues towards unity .",
    "the effect discussed above which is comparable to a prolongation of the time series , leads to the separation of the spectral densities into two peaks .",
    "if @xmath145 becomes too large , this is counteracted , and the two peaks merge again .",
    "consequently , there must be an optimal values for @xmath145 . in the numerical simulation we found that it is roughly @xmath156 .    for infinitely long time series @xmath42",

    "we arrive at @xmath174 this correctly reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq3.1 ] ) for @xmath155 . as already argued , the peaks due to the first term move towards the peak due to the third term if @xmath145 is made large .",
    "again , the @xmath165 peaks are smeared out if the length of the time series is finite .",
    "we show in  [ appb ] that the noisy spectral density @xmath175 of the power mapped correlation matrix can be estimated by @xmath176 here , the parameters @xmath177 and @xmath178 collect the effects due to the smearing out and @xmath179 approximates the center of the gaussian due the true correlations in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq4.15 ] ) .",
    "the third term estimates the peaks due to the noise . as discussed in  [ appb ] , these two contributions are affected differently as finite lengths of the time series are concerned .",

    "the general trend is reproduced for the three @xmath145 values . for @xmath156 , however , the most interesting value , the agreement is good .",
    "this is encouraging , because the steps that led to the estimate  ( [ eq4.15 ] ) involved various approximations . in any case , as already argued , the practical applicability of our ansatz  ( [ eq4.21 ] ) is not affected by these scaling questions .",
    "+    as figure  [ fig_tp1_t ] shows , both standard deviations @xmath198 and @xmath199 become smaller as @xmath145 is made larger while @xmath38 is kept fixed .",
    "this is why the power mapping can be viewed as effectively prolonging the time series : to obtain given values for the standard deviations , one can either keep @xmath155 and make the time series longer or make @xmath145 larger and leave @xmath38 unchanged .",
    "for example , compared to the correlation matrix with @xmath220 and @xmath155 , the noise is reduced by 60% when one goes to @xmath221 without changing @xmath155 and it is reduced by 75% when one applies the power mapping with @xmath156 while keeping @xmath220 .",
    "this is most important for applications , because time series for stocks with @xmath221 , say , are seldom available , while time series with @xmath220 are easily accessible .",
    "thus , power mapping can lead to better estimates for the risk and for related quantities such as the value  at  risk  @xcite .",
    "we developed a new method to identify and estimate the noise and , hence , also the strength of the true correlations in a financial correlation matrix .",
    "the essence of our approach is the power mapping .",
    "it suppresses those matrix elements which can be associated with the noise .",
    "our approach could be seen as an generalization and extension of shrinking techniques  @xcite used in contexts different from the present one .",
    "importantly , the spectral density changes drastically due to the suppression .",
    "the method itself yields a criterion to choose the optimal power . loosely speaking",
    ", our method can be interpreted as an effective prolongation of the time series .",
    "this feature makes it particularly suited for problems in which , for whatever reason , only relatively short time series are available .",
    "we expect that our approach , which is new to the best of our knowledge , can also be useful in other time series problems .",
    "although we presented our method in the framework of stocks , we emphasize that it is applicable to every correlation matrix of time series , independent of what these time series describe : in the context of finance , these can be stocks , interest rates , exchange rates or other risk factors , or , in other fields of science , completely different observables . moreover , advantageously , our approach does not involve further data processing or any other additional input .    since our method does not use the large eigenvalues due to the branches , it is a fundamentally different alternative to the technique of gopikrishnan et al .",
    "@xcite which is based on such information .",
    "our method automatically takes into account all branches , because all of them will contribute to the bulk of the spectral density .",
    "thus , even if a large eigenvalue is not large enough to lie outside the bulk , our method will not miss the contribution of the corresponding branch .",
