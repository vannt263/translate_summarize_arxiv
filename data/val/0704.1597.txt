    "a quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) is a qualitative change in the ground state of a quantum system as some parameter is varied @xcite .",
    "contrary to classical phase transitions , qpts occur at zero temperature and are due to the effect of quantum fluctuations and not of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the previous definition is very general , however , the abrupt change in the structure of the ground state that define the phase transition can have different consequences depending on the different cases .",
    "the ground state energy may become non - analytic when approaching the critical parameter .",
    "the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state may go to zero in the critical point .",
    "the correlations at the critical point may decay as power laws instead of exponentially indicating a diverging correlation length .",
    "it is possible to find quantum systems which have some of these indications of the qpt and not others @xcite .",
    "for this reason , alternative ways for the classification of qpts and for the numerical investigation of the critical parameters in a qpt can be very helpful .    in recent years",
    "quantum information concepts have started to be applied to the study of qpts .",
    "one central concept in quantum information theory is the concept of entanglement @xcite .",
    "two quantum systems in a pure state are entangled if their state can not be written as the product of two separate pure states for each of the quantum systems .",
    "entanglement measures quantum correlations and as correlations are typically maximum at the critical points of qpts it was realized that some entanglement measures may have a singularity or a maximum at the critical point .",
    "the amount of entanglement has been shown to be a very sensitive quantity to the value of the critical parameter governing the phase transition @xcite .",
    "in particular , concurrence @xcite has been used to investigate spin models and this quantity shows an extreme or singular behavior at the corresponding critical points @xcite .",
    "the block - block entanglement between two parts of the system has also been used , establishing connections with conformal field theory @xcite .    in a recent work gu _",
    "analyzed the local entanglement and its relationship with phase transitions in the one - dimensional and two - dimensional xxz spin models @xcite .",
    "the local entanglement was measured with the von - neumann entropy of the two - site density matrix .",
    "it is more convenient numerically than the block - block entanglement as the size of the density matrix needed for the latter quantity grows exponentially with the size of the block .",
    "using bethe ansatz results for the one - dimensional xxz model gu and coworkers showed that the local information obtained from the entanglement entropy of the two - site density matrix is enough to study the phase transitions that occur in this model . considering blocks larger than the characteristic length scales of the system ( that in the critical point diverge ) was shown to be unnecessary as the entanglement between a block of two spins and",
    "the rest of the system is sufficient to reveal the most important information about the system .",
    "their results hint to the possibility of using these properties for the numerical study of phase transitions with small systems .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to study numerically the local entanglement as a function of the size of the system .",
    "in particular , we will concentrate in the critical points of the phase transitions .",
    "we will study a one - dimensional model of spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interactions that can be transformed through the jordan - wigner transformation to the xxz model with spins at each site @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for repulsive interaction @xmath1 the ground state performs a kosterlitz - thouless type phase transition from a luttinger liquid to a charge density wave , which corresponds to an antiferromagnetically ordered state in the spin picture . for attractive interaction @xmath2",
    "there is a phase transition to a phase separated state , which corresponds to a ferromagnet in the spin picture .",
    "we will show that the bond entropy @xmath3 enables us to determine the critical points of both quantum phase transitions with an astonishing accuracy , albeit they present very different characteristics and symmetries .",
    "we will show how these differences are reflected in the behavior of the bond entropy .",
    "finally we include next - nearest - neighbor interaction to test the generality of our finding .",
    "the effect of longer ranged interaction was studied before in the context of multiple umklapp scattering @xcite . in this case",
    "the interaction can now lead to phase transitions at fillings different from 1/2 and to ordering patterns with increased unit cell .",
    "we shall consider the one - dimensional spinless fermions model with next - neighbor interactions .",
    "@xmath4 where the operators appearing in the formula are the usual fermionic creation , annihilation , and number operator at site i , @xmath5 is the total number of sites , @xmath6 is the hopping matrix element between neighboring sites , and @xmath7 is the nearest - neighbor interaction strength .",
    "an important property of this model is that it can be transformed into the xxz spin @xmath8 model through the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 for an even number of particles a phase term appears in the boundary condtion when we apply the jordan - wigner transformation to hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_spinless ] ) . as we are not interested in this even - odd effect we will consider periodic ( anti - periodic ) boundary conditions , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , for n odd ( even ) and both models will be equivalent in our examples .",
    "although we will mainly consider the spinless fermion model we will make comments regarding the equivalent behavior of both models when we believe it will be useful to clarify some situation ( specially in the `` ferromagnetic '' phase ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_spinless ] ) commutes with the total @xmath12 operator so the total number of particles is a conserved quantity and we will consider subspaces with a definite number of fermions , equivalent to consider subspaces with a definite value of @xmath13 in the xxz model .",
    "this model has an interesting phase diagram depending on the value of the ratio of the interaction parameter and the hopping term @xmath14 and also on the number of particles @xmath15 . without loss of generality we can consider @xmath16 and consider the phases as we change @xmath7 . for @xmath17",

    "@xmath20 , there is another transition point at @xmath21 . for @xmath22",
    "the system is a charge density wave type insulator , the transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type and the order parameter depends exponentially on the difference @xmath23 making an accurate numerical determination of the transition point notoriously hard .",

    "we used at least 500 states per block for the @xmath50 sites leading to an discarded entropy below @xmath51 , and 1400 states per block for the 36 site system ( see below ) , including the five lowest lying states in order to treat the degeneracies correctly , leading to a discarded entropy typically below @xmath52 , and up to @xmath53 close to the phase transitions and applied always eleven finite lattice sweeps .",
