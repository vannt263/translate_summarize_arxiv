    "primordial inflation @xcite is now regarded as a part of the `` standard '' cosmology because it not only solves the flatness and the horizon problems but also accounts for the origin of primordial fluctuations @xcite . to construct a model of inflation",
    ", one usually assumes a scalar field that drives inflation ( called an inflaton ) outside the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "this is because there are no scalar fields in the sm except for the higgs boson and it has been found that the sm higgs boson can not be responsible for inflation as long as its kinetic term is canonical and it is minimally coupled to gravity  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty here lies in the fact that the self interaction of the sm higgs boson is so strong that the resultant primordial density fluctuation would be too large to be consistent with the present observational data  @xcite .    to construct inflation models within the sm ,",
    "several variants of higgs - driven inflation have been proposed so far .",
    "they include models with a non - minimal coupling term to gravity @xcite and with a non - minimal coupling of the higgs kinetic term with the einstein tensor @xcite.hler potential for the higgs multiplet is assumed . ] the amplitude of the curvature perturbation is suppressed due to the large effective planck scale in the former case , while in the latter case the same thing is caused by the enhanced kinetic function which effectively reduce the self coupling of the higgs boson .    the simplest way to enhance the kinetic energy would be to add a non - canonical higher order kinetic term .",
    "a number of novel inflation models with non - standard kinetic terms have been proposed , such as k - inflation @xcite , ghost condensate @xcite , and dirac - born - infeld inflation @xcite . when incorporating higher order kinetic terms special care",
    "must be taken in order to avoid unwanted ghost instabilities . since newly introduced degrees of freedom",
    "will lead easily to ghosts , it would be desirable if the scalar field does not give rise to a new degree of freedom in spite of its higher derivative nature .",
    "it has recently been shown that special combinations of higher order kinetic terms in the lagrangian produce derivatives no higher than two both in the gravitational and scalar field equations @xcite . a scalar field having this property",
    "is often called the galileon because it possesses a galilean shift symmetry in the minkowski background .",
    "such a scalar field has been studied in the context of modified gravity and dark energy in  @xcite .",
    "recently , an inflation model dubbed as `` g - inflation '' was proposed  @xcite , in which inflation is driven by a scalar field with a galileon - like kinetic term . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the background and perturbation dynamics of g - inflation were investigated , revealing interesting features brought by the galileon term .",
    "for example , scale - invariant scalar perturbations can be generated even in the exactly de sitter background , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio can take a significantly larger value than in the standard inflation models , violating the standard consistency relation . other aspects of g - inflation have been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new higgs inflation model by adding a galileon - like kinetic term to the standard higgs lagrangian .",
    "we show that a self coupling constant of the order of the unity is compatible with the present observational data thanks to the kinetic term enhanced by the galileon effect .",
    "we however start with a general discussion on g - inflation driven by the potential term because our potential - driven g - inflation is not restricted only to the higgs field .",
    "we first give a criterion to determine which term becomes dominant in the kinetic term .",
    "then , the slow - roll parameters and the slow - roll conditions are concretely given in terms of the potential @xmath3 and the function characterizing the galileon term .",
    "we also derive the expressions for primordial fluctuations in terms of the slow - roll parameters , and find a new model - independent consistency relation for a potential - driven g - inflation model , which is quite useful for discriminating it from the standard inflation model with a canonical kinetic term .",
    "it turns out , however , that primordial non - gaussianity of the curvature fluctuation is not large in potential - driven g - inflation . finally ,",
    "as a concrete example of a potential - driven g - inflation model , we propose a higgs g - inflation model .",
    "this model predicts that the scalar spectral index @xmath4 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 for the number of @xmath6-folds @xmath7 , which , together with the new consistency relation @xmath8 , makes our higgs g - inflation model testable in near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we make a general discussion on the potential - driven g - inflation model . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply it to more concrete examples , which have chaotic - type , new - type , and hybrid type potential forms . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a new class of inflation model that regards the standard model higgs boson as an inflaton in the context of g - inflation .",
    "final section is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",

    "this implies that in the presence of the galileon - like derivative interaction slow - roll inflation can take place even if the potential is rather steep .    for later convenience",
    "we define @xmath45",
    ". it will be also useful to note that @xmath46 this means that even if the galileon dominates the dynamics of slow - roll inflation , the standard part of the lagrangian remains much larger than the galileon interaction term , @xmath47    let us make a brief comment on the initial condition for the scalar field .",
    "the field may initially be off along the slow - roll trajectory  ( [ dotphi ] ) . as long as @xmath48 , the field safely approaches the trajectory  ( [ dotphi ] ) . if @xmath49 initially , the situation is more subtle , because the solution would approach another branch of the slow - roll attractor and the field would go on to climb up the potential .",
