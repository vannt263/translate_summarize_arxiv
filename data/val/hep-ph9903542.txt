    "if neither will be true but uhecr will point instead to `` local '' galaxies with evidence for a central supermassive black hole , that would imply that the existence of a black hole dynamo is not a sufficient condition for the presence of pronounced jets and uhecrs are created by the remnants of dead quasars @xcite .",
    "if none of the above will be true , arrival directions will be almost isotropic on large angular scales but uhecrs will cluster on small scales , then perhaps extragalactic magnetic fields are much stronger than previously thought @xcite , or perhaps cosmic necklaces do exist .",

    "discovery of heavy relic x - particles will mean that the model of inflation is likely correct , or that at least standard early friedmann evolution from the singularity is ruled out , since otherwise x - particles would have been inevitably overproduced @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays can probe the spectrum of elementary particles in the superheavy range and can give an unique opportunity for investigation of the earliest epoch of evolution of the universe , starting with the amplification of vacuum fluctuations during inflation through fine details of gravitational interaction and down to the physics of reheating .",
