    "modern and demanding application of radial velocities , like those associated with the search for extra - solar planets , have promoted the introduction of new methods of wavelength calibration .",
    "the key to success has been recording of the reference wavelength grid for to the whole duration of the science exposure and through the same optical train and path .",
    "two approaches have been followed : the _ parallel _ ( where thorium lines going through telescope optics are recoded on the ccd close and parallel to the science spectrum with an exposure lasting as long as the science observation ) , and the _ iodine - cell _ one ( the stellar spectrum passes through and is absorbed by a cell filled with iodine vapors , that mark the stellar spectrum with a huge number of sharp and equally intense absorption lines ) .",
    "both approaches require delicate instrumentation , careful maintenance and dedicated spectrographs .",
    "as such they are not easily manageable on small , all - purpose telescopes .",
    "we propose here a third , independent way to mark with reference wavelengths the science spectrum as it is recorded , through exactly the same optical train and path .",
    "it consists of using optical fibers with recorded in them bragg gratings that allows undisturbed passage of all wavelengths except a selection of few ones that will appear in the spectrum as sharp , deep absorption lines of constant and pre - selected wavelengths .",
    "the latter are then used as a reference grid to accurately wavelength calibrate the science spectrum .",
    "the system is easy and fast , allows to decouple the spectrograph from the telescope and operate it in a controlled environment , requires minimal mechanical work to be adapted to existing spectrographs , the marking absorption lines can be placed at any preferred wavelength , and the fibers can be mass - produced at low cost for distribution to interested observatories .",
    "fbgs can be easily installed on spectrographs already designed to operate in multiple fiber mode .",
    "the rave project ( steinmetz 2003 ) , with its fixed wavelength range , would represent an ideal case for the application of fbgs .",
    "the fbgs ( fiber bragg grating ) appear of potential interest also to gaia .",
    "the latter s spectrograph operates in tdi , slit - less mode with thousands of spectra simultaneously crossing the field of view as the satellite spins .",
    "no conventional calibration lamp can be used , obviously .",
    "the base - lined wavelength calibration procedure foresees using stars of recognized constant radial velocity as they travel across the spectrograph focal plane , by accurately linking their astrometric position on the sky to the wavelength of their absorption lines on the pixels of the ccds .    a bundle of fbgs properly introduced in the gaia spectrograph optical train would mark with a set of properly placed reference absorption lines the spectra of all stars entering the field of view .",
    "the fbgs could become the prime wavelength calibration mean of gaia spectra ( particularly for preliminary solutions while the mission is still flying ) , or a backup for the method based on standard radial velocity stars in case this would not satisfactorily operate for whatever reason once the satellite will reach l@xmath0 .",
    "the fbgs dissipate no power and have no movable parts .",
    "they should also stand the low operating temperatures of the satellite in l@xmath0 and should do not degrade with time , and thus looking ideal for use in space .",
    "no fbg has ever been used as proposed in this paper , and thus confirmatory tests are required . at the astronomical observatory of padova",
    "we plan to manufacture and test prototype fibers for the gaia / rave wavelength range to check their performance with actual observations at the telescope .",
    "fiber gratings are made by laterally exposing the core of the fiber to a periodic pattern of intense ultraviolet light .",
    "the exposure produces a permanent increase in the refractive index of the fiber s core , creating a fixed index modulation according to the exposure pattern : this fixed pattern is called a grating . at each periodic change of refraction , a small amount of light is reflected ( bragg diffraction ) .",
    "all the reflected light signals combine coherently to one large reflection at a particular wavelength when the grating period is approximately half the input light wavelength .",
    "this is referred as the bragg condition and the wavelength at which this reflection occurs is called the bragg wavelength ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "light at wavelengths different from @xmath1 , which are not phase matched , will pass unabsorbed through the fiber . thus , light propagates through the grating with negligible attenuation and only those wavelengths that satisfy the bragg condition are affected and strongly back - reflected .",
    "application of this technology to astronomical spectra at gaia wavelengths is attractive for two basic reasons : ( @xmath2 ) the technology is already mature with the tele - communication industry that operate it in the near - ir , down to 1  @xmath3 m , and ( @xmath4 ) the limited @xmath5 range observed by gaia and rave requires only a limited number of reference lines to be properly calibrated ( see discussion in desidera and munari 2003 ) , which in turn means an easier fbgs production .",
    "exposing a photosensitive fiber , usually germanium - doped ( yuen , 1982 ) , to an intensity pattern of ultraviolet radiation ( at wavelengths between 240 and 255 nm , where the germanium has an absorption band ) is used to produce ( i.e. write ) a fiber bragg grating . in its basic form",
    "the grating selectively reflects light at the bragg wavelength @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the grating spacing and @xmath8 is the effective index of refraction .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on fabrication parameters : @xmath8 depend on the modal dispersion characteristics of the fiber and lies , for each mode , between the core and cladding indices .",
    "the functional form of the normalized frequency ( @xmath9 ) parameter is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diameter of the fiber core , @xmath12 is the free space wavelength , @xmath13 the core index and @xmath14 the clad index .",
    "note that the difference between the two squared index is also the numerical aperture of the fiber . for low enough @xmath9 values",
    "the fiber is single mode and only one bragg reflection is observed at @xmath15 wavelength given above . at a certain value of @xmath9 the fiber become two moded with two separated bragg wavelengths , and for larger @xmath9 values many more modes begin to appear in the fiber grating spectrum .",
    "the lowest order or fundamental mode has the longest @xmath1 , and the higher order modes have progressively shorter @xmath1 with the cladding index giving the limit on the shortest @xmath1 .",
    "the peak reflectivity is an increasing function of the grating length and of the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( lam & garside , 1981 ) .    recording fbgs inside a fiber usually involves interference between two coherent uv laser beams that precisely define the spacing between the grating planes . for symmetric incidence and an angle @xmath16 between the uv beams ,",
    "the pitch of the recorded grating is 0.5@xmath17 , where @xmath12 is the illumination wavelength .",
    "the basic interferometric setup splits the laser beam to create an interference pattern on the fiber ( morey et al .",
    ", 1989 ) as shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) .",
    "because the beams travel different paths , the laser must have sufficient temporal coherence to account for path - length mismatch , and good spatial coherence .",
    "the sensitivity to mechanical instabilities of this method of fbg production can make difficult to produce identical replicas .",
    "the other way for writing fbgs is to use phase mask to generate multiple beams ( hill et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "two of the beams carry approximately 40% of the total energy and closely overlap the phase mask surface to create an interference pattern at the desired bragg wavelength .",
    "the fiber - phase mask assembly can be illuminated either by a large beam to cover the full fiber bragg grating length or by a small scanning beam . because the fiber is usually in proximity to the phase mask , the assembly is a very stable mechanical system , suitable for mass - production of identical fbg replicas .",
    "the pattern recorded into the fiber is a copy of the phase mask ( pitch and chirp ) scaled by about 50% .",
