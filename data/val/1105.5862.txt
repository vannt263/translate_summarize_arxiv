    "unlike any thermal fluctuation , the fluctuation at a critical point of a finite - temperature continuous quantum phase transition ( @xmath0qpt ) is specifically called quantum fluctuation ( even for finite temperatures ) because it is related to the properties of electrons at a constant temperature , and therefore , it is still subject to the established heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "an example in this respect is the existence of a @xmath0qpt ( due to changing pressure ) , which is well - known for ice at a constant temperature ( @xmath1k ) .",
    "the readers are referred to an elementary and straightforward discussion on these two issues ( quantum fluctuation and @xmath0qpt in ice ) given by sachdev  @xcite .",
    "but little did we know then , that physically , and logically , not all quantum fluctuations ( @xmath2 ) will have to become `` irrelevant '' when @xmath3k , _",
    "i.e. _ , not all @xmath4 maximum when @xmath5k .",
    "if the statement all quantum fluctuations become maximum when @xmath5k is true , then chemical reactions can not exist .",
    "the above argument can be proven if we can prove the existence of some quantum fluctuations that become large for finite temperatures or when @xmath6k .",
    "the quantum fluctuations discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite are due to temperature - independent external tuners , namely , magnetic fields , pressure and chemical composition affecting the spin carried by the electrons .",
    "therefore , the quantum fluctuation discussed therein are entirely related to spin ordering and spin disordering , giving rise to antiferromagnetism ( afm ) , ferromagnetism ( fm ) and paramagnetism ( pm ) .",
    "even if the system is none of these magnetism - related , spin will still come to play its role in one way or another when @xmath5k .",
    "for example , a cooper pair  @xcite in a superconductor consists of two electrons , one with @xmath7 ( spin - down ) and the other with @xmath8 ( spin - up ) .",
    "anyway , it is well known that the strength of this spin ordering ( afm or fm ) or cooper pairing ( pairing of electrons with spin up and down ) is maximum for @xmath9k , and the ordering or pairing gets destroyed when the electrons got excited , or when the cooper pairs break up for some @xmath3k .",
    "rightly so , sachdev has correctly pointed out that the quantum phase transitions discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite do not include the temperature effect .",
    "furthermore , these quantum fluctuations can be examined even for @xmath3k provided that @xmath10 can be expanded for higher temperatures if @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we can certainly add here that the temperature effect was excluded ( or included as a form of expansion on @xmath10 ) because the objective there and then was to evaluate the qualitative changes to the ground - state wave function of a particular system by varying the temperature - independent external tuners ( for @xmath9k ) , not because qpt has been proven not to exist for @xmath6k . as a matter of fact",
    ", we prove here the existence of a qpt for @xmath6k .",
    "now , to prove the existence of a particular qpt for @xmath6k , we need to understand how the thermal energy initiates a quantum fluctuation during melting and solidification processes , and then evaluate the relationship between the thermally driven first - order tpt and @xmath0qpt . here , @xmath0qpt requires quantitative changes to the properties of the electrons ( due to the changes in their energy levels ) that need some qualitative and/or quantitative changes to their wave functions .",
    "these changes are driven by thermal energy , not by the temperature - independent external tuners listed above .",
    "in contrast , the commonly accepted quantum phase transition for @xmath9k ( @xmath12qpt ) also requires quantitative changes to the properties of the electrons ( due to the changes in their energy levels ) that need some qualitative and/or quantitative changes to their wave functions .",
    "however , the above changes for @xmath9k are driven by temperature - independent external tuners alone , not by thermal energy .",
    "hence , we should not reserve all `` quantum phase transitions '' exclusively for transitions driven by temperature - independent external tuners for @xmath9k , and not for transitions driven by thermal energy .",
    "such a reservation is somewhat naive because the external drivers can be anything , including thermal energy , for as long as these drivers can initiate quantum fluctuations for any @xmath13k .",
    "we emphasize here that a particular quantum fluctuation that causes a phase transition is the one that should determine whether a given phase transition has a quantum origin or not , not by some _ ad hoc _ arguments .",
    "of course , any given qpt can be driven by thermal energy , with further assistance from the temperature - independent tuners , or a qpt can be suppressed if one external tuner competes with other tuners . in this case , it is just a matter of finding which tuner is in command of which interaction and quantum fluctuation .",
    "the quantum fluctuation we are concerned with here is the fluctuation in the energy - level spectra ( energy - level spacing ) at a critical point .",
    "these energy levels refer to electrons , of course . in any case",
    ", we have said enough . at the end of this section",
    ", some of you may come to realize that the quantum - fluctuation causing thermal energy holds the key to unify thermodynamics and quantum mechanics .",
    "having explained that , we now continue with our introduction to @xmath0qpt . the quantum fluctuation associated to @xmath0qpt occurring at a finite temperature quantum critical point ( @xmath14qcp )",
    "requires quantitative changes to the wave functions , such that the quantum fluctuation with an energy scale , @xmath15 can be written as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the planck constant divided by 2@xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the doping ( @xmath22)-dependent frequency and some critical temperature ( a @xmath14qcp ) , respectively .",
    "later , we will come to see why the wave functions need to be changed quantitatively for @xmath0qpt .",
    "for a @xmath23qcp , the relevant inequality is simply @xmath24 because @xmath25k . here , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are related to different chemical composition , while @xmath29 represents a certain physical property under investigation .",
    "for example , for the melting process ( chemical dissociation ) , @xmath30 , and it satisfies the classical phase transition ( due to thermal fluctuation with increasing temperature for a given chemical composition ) , without any microscopic understanding as to the reasons why and how the translational symmetry breaks ( ice to water ) .",
    "this does not imply melting is a classical process not involving electrons .",
    "for instance , we have proven how the energy level spacing evolve and give rise to a changing interaction strength between a polarizable water molecule physisorbed onto the mgo surface , which then initiate the water molecule dissociation at a constant temperature  @xcite . within the ionization energy theory ( iet )",
    "@xcite , we can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ionization energy of a particular compound , and it is also known as the energy level spacing within the renormalization group method  @xcite . hence , during chemical dissociation with changing chemical composition , @xmath32 is a dynamical parameter , giving rise to quantum fluctuation .",
    "importantly , much below the melting point , the fluctuation in @xmath32 is caused by the energy level crossings , changes in the valence states of the constituent elements , and defects due to different chemical compositions ( doping ) along a constant temperature line .",
    "such fluctuations ( due to defects and valence states ) are responsible for the changes in the constant - temperature and composition - dependent ( i ) resistivity of ferromagnets  @xcite , ( ii ) resistivity in the normal - state of superconductors  @xcite , ( iii ) non - blinking effect in quantum dots  @xcite and ( iv ) reversible carrier - type transition in oxides  @xcite .",
    "apart from that , experimental and theoretical developments of the popular zero temperature quantum phase transitions ( @xmath12qpt ) in strongly interacting solids were also investigated independently , namely , in two dimensional systems  @xcite , in solids with respect to spin ordering  @xcite , in bose - hubbard model  @xcite , and in antiferromagnets  @xcite .    in the subsequent section ,",
    "we introduce and explain why and how the molten alkali halides give rise to the first - order thermal phase transition , and how this transition is related to the finite temperature quantum phase transition .",
    "subsequently , we venture deeper into the details of quantum phase transitions and quantum fluctuations with respect to the ionization energy theory , which involves wave function transformations and electronic phase transitions . along the way , the theory is discussed and crosschecked whenever necessary against the experimental observations .",
    "finally , we will conclude that ( a ) the finite - temperature continuous quantum phase transition is responsible for all first - order thermal phase transitions , and ( b ) at a critical point of a first - order thermal phase transition , a non - divergent time - dependent specific heat can be proven to exist .",
    "both points in ( a ) and ( b ) involves some physics beyond the traditional phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "here , we will give unambiguous logical proofs ( supported by experimental results , of course ) on the origin of thermal and quantum fluctuations due to temperature and doping ( or @xmath32 ) within iet .",
    "but before doing so , we need to justify the reasons why we have selected salts made up of single - valent cations and anions from group 17 of the periodic table .",
    "table  [ table : i ] lists the diatomic bonding energies and melting points of these salts such that the melting points decrease systematically with decreasing bonding energies from f to i. such a decreasing trend can be precisely overlapped with the decreasing ionization energies of the anions , namely , @xmath33(1681 kjmol@xmath34 ) @xmath35 @xmath36(1251 kjmol@xmath34 ) @xmath35",
    "@xmath37(1140 kjmol@xmath34 ) @xmath35",
    "@xmath38(1008 kjmol@xmath34 ) .",
    "the values in the inequalities are given in table  [ table : ii ] , follow the values marked with `` * '' .",
    "interestingly however , for a given anion , the decreasing melting points do not agree with the ionization energy values of the cations : li , na , k and rb ( follow their values listed in table  [ table : ii ] , marked with `` @xmath39 ' ' ) .",
    ".experimental values for the melting points and diatomic bonding energies of salts obtained from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the systematic decrease of the melting points and diatomic bonding energies with respect to anions ( from f to i with increasing @xmath40 ) satisfy the decreasing ionization energies for the same anions , from f to i. see the text and table  [ table : ii ] ( follow the values marked with `` * '' ) for details . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : ii ]    in table  [ table : ii ] , we have deliberately selected systems consisting of single valent cations and anions from group 17 to avoid effects from different electronic interactions due to different number ( and type ) of constituent atoms in a given molecule . to understand this point , we again use molecular systems , in which , for a no@xmath41 molecule , n acts as a cation , while o as an anion , which means that we need to consider the valence state of 4 + since four electrons have been transfered from n@xmath42 to o@xmath43 .",
    "this electron - transfer is due to @xmath44 ( see table  [ table : i ] ) . in contrast",
    ", n is an anion in nh@xmath45 molecule due to @xmath46 where three electrons from three hydrogen atoms are transfered to nitrogen , giving n@xmath47h@xmath48 . thus far",
    ", the analyses are correct .",
    "however , the polarizability of the molecule no@xmath41 _ does not _ solely depend on these four electrons contributed by nitrogen if we compare n@xmath42o@xmath49 with n@xmath47h@xmath48 because we can not simplify the analysis by comparing @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( 3 electrons contributed by three hydrogen ions ) only .",
    "if we do so , then obviously we have @xmath52 that falsely allows us to conclude @xmath53 because @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the displacement polarizability .",
    "in other words , we can not use the above inequality ( @xmath56 ) to directly compare @xmath55 between no@xmath57 and nh@xmath58 molecules because n acts as a cation in a no@xmath57 molecule , while it is an anion for the molecule , nh@xmath58 .",
    "this implies that we need to take both the cationic- and anionic - effect into account explicitly for an accurate logical analysis , which have been correctly invoked in ref .",
    "however , the anionic - effect can be neglected when we compare co with o@xmath41 because in these molecules , oxygen is the anion and therefore @xmath59 is valid  @xcite . on the other hand , the justification required to neglect the cationic - effect for doped - pnictide superconductors is given in ref .",
    "finally , taking both cationic- and anionic - effect into account means that for large ( many - electron ) cations such as k ( @xmath40 = 19 ) and rb ( @xmath40 = 37 ) , there will always be some significant amount of polarization ( due to large screening ) from the outer core electrons , even though effectively , k@xmath60 and rb@xmath60 are single - valent ions .",
    "this second- or third - electron polarization is negligible for few - electron atoms ( due to small screening ) , namely , li ( @xmath40 = 3 ) and interestingly , also for na ( @xmath40 = 11 ) .",
    "note here that we need smaller and larger ionization energies for cations and anions , respectively for stronger ionic bonds .",
    "therefore , incorporating this additional amount of polarization ( for cations ) implies larger @xmath61 or equivalently , smaller @xmath62 that should reduce the melting point as has been observed experimentally ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "importantly , this correction does not apply for anions if a given system consists of mostly ionic bonds because the anions are judged solely on their ability to attract electrons from the cations . on the contrary , for systems with mostly covalent bonds , we need to consider both cationic- and anionic - effect simultaneously as carried out in ref .",
    "the existence of this additional polarization is consistent with the experimental results shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq:2001 ] ) and  ( [ eq:4002 ] ) , from a gas to a liquid phase , and then to a solid phase .",
    "for example , taking @xmath108 and @xmath109 , one immediately obtains the non - interacting gas phase . for a liquid consisting of identical atoms , and",

    "is a sufficient model hamiltonian for this weakly interacting liquid . on the contrary , if the liquid consists of two different atoms such that one of them is highly polarizable ( cation - forming ( or electron - donating ) atoms ) , while the other atom contains highly non - polarizable electrons ( anion - forming ( electron - accepting ) atoms ) , then the liquid consisting of these atoms forms a strongly interacting liquid .",
    "for example , any molten solid close to the solidification point , or slightly above the melting point .",
    "now , you should not be carried away into thinking that a coulombic liquid is different from the atomic molten system .",
    "for example , a system that consists of highly polarized atoms forms a strongly interacting coulombic liquid , while the weakly interacting coulombic liquid consists of weakly polarized atoms .",
    "obviously , unpolarized or uncharged system can not form such a ( coulombic ) liquid . secondly",
    ", the model discussed above nicely corresponds to the experimental results listed in tables  [ table : i ] and  [ table : ii ] , namely , lif , naf , kf and rbf have the largest melting points relative to other listed anions because the ionization energy for f is the largest ( with the strongest ability to attract electrons ) , compared to i , br and cl . this implies that at the melting point , the breaking and forming of stronger bonds will lead to a strongly interacting coulombic liquid , as it should be . finally , based on the above model",
    ", the bond - formation and - breaking mechanism is due to the quantum phase transition ( giving rise to electronic phase transition ) , which requires a wave function transformation . the electronic phase transition stated above has got to be nonadiabatic because of electron transfer during bond - formation or -breaking ( chemical reactions ) .",
    "however , the adiabatic approximation can still be applied , if and only if the hamiltonian ( @xmath110 ) describing this chemical process is known explicitly  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that when one cools a molten solid , then one needs a specific amount of thermal energy or simply heat ( @xmath111 ) to initiate the quantum fluctuation right at a critical point ( at the melting point ) to give rise to a wave - function transformation ( electronic phase transition )  @xcite .",
    "any heat larger than @xmath111 will not activate the wave function transformation required for the liquid to solid phase transition .",
    "for example , any @xmath112 implies @xmath113 and therefore , coulomb repulsion dominates . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath114 then one has @xmath115 , which implies that the heat is insufficient to overcome the bonding energy in the solid phase , prior to melting . in the remainder of this paper , our focus is to understand how @xmath116 is related to entropy , specific heat and to the energy - level spacing ( @xmath56 ) of the molten system .",

    "later , we will expose why and how the fluctuation in @xmath56 ( at a critical point ) forces us to impose time - dependence into @xmath56 .",

    "we went on to renormalize the entropy and the bose - einstein statistics solely to prove the existence of the non - divergent specific heat capacity at the critical point via the energy level spacing renormalization method . at the critical point",
    ", the thermal energy is used to change the energy - level spacing of a system , which in turn changes the physico - chemical properties of that system .",
    "those properties are of course different if the system is in solid phase , compared to liquid .",
    "the critical points we chose to investigate were the melting points of single - valent ionic bonded salts .    here",
    ", we have formally shown that the finite - temperature continuous quantum phase transition ( @xmath0qpt ) is responsible for the thermal phase transition during melting and solidification processes , as well as during substitutional doping at a constant temperature . along the way",
    ", we also have proven that the first - order transition in the constant - pressure specific heat between water and ice satisfies a @xmath0qpt . in view of the analyses for alkali halide salts and water - ice system",
    ", we found that the @xmath0qpt is responsible for the liquid@xmath218solid and water@xmath218ice phase transitions , supported by experimental results .",
    "in addition , we have given sufficient proofs to claim that all first - order thermal phase transitions are equivalent to finite - temperature quantum phase transitions , which will lead us to the unification of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics .",
    "the formal proofs developed herein allow one to obtain the precise physical mechanisms involved right at the melting point of a given solid , beyond the usual physics of a discontinuous thermal phase transition .",
    "in other words , our approach avoids the diverging thermodynamic variables ( when @xmath342 ) at critical points ( @xmath343 ) , which are usually in the form of @xmath344 where @xmath345 is some constant .",
    "for example , we have been able to formally prove the existence of a finite - temperature quantum phase transition due to some wave function transformations ( giving rise to changing ionization energies ) during the melting of alkali halides , and also when water freezes over .",
    "this means that one can gain a far more detailed understanding of the physical phenomena occurring at a critical point as a result of quantum effects ( namely , wave function transformations that give rise to a quantum phase transition ) .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the discontinuous thermal phase transition is actually a continuous quantum phase transition , which is observable as an electronic phase transition .",
    "this electronic phase transition is the cause for the solid - to - liquid ( or liquid - to - solid ) and liquid - to - gas ( or gas - to - liquid ) transformations with well defined ( non - divergent ) thermodynamical properties at the critical points .",
    "moreover , we found that the theoretical predictions extracted from the proofs are very well supported by the experimental results obtained from the alkali halides , namely , the atomic ionization energies , melting points and diatomic bonding energies . for water and ice",
    ", we had the constant - pressure specific heats and atomic ionization energies in complete agreement with the time - dependent specific heat formula .",
