    "many recent works have explored mechanisms to generate spin accumulations and spin currents by passing electric currents through spin - orbit coupled electronic systems . on the theoretical side ,",
    "two related mechanisms have been proposed in disordered metals as alternatives to spin injection via ferromagnets or by optical means .",
    "they are current - induced transverse spin currents or voltages , a.k.a . the spin hall effect ,  @xcite and current - induced spin polarization ( cisp ) .",
    "@xcite the interplay between the two effects has been investigated in ref .  .",
    "these effects have been to some extent demonstrated experimentally ,  @xcite and recent theoretical works have extended them to include the mesoscopic regime , where fluctuations of both longitudinal and transverse spin currents in mesoscopic ballistic and diffusive systems are being investigated .",
    "@xcite most remarkably , it has been found that the same universality that applies to mesoscopic charge transport  @xcite also applies to mesoscopic spin transport .",
    "@xcite    the main focus of these theoretical as well as experimental efforts is to use spin - orbit interactions ( soi ) as a way to couple external electric fields to electronic spins , the hope being to generate , manipulate and/or measure spin currents and accumulations by purely electrical means .",
    "soi , however , also has the undesired effect of randomizing electronic spins .",
    "@xcite this dichotomy theoretically limits the use of soi based magnetoelectric devices as components of information processors to the regime where the size of the device is much less than the spin relaxation length . a way to increase",
    "the spin relaxation length has been proposed in ref .   for systems which exhibit soi of both the rashba  @xcite @xmath10 and the dresselhaus type  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are pauli matrices .",
    "when the two interactions have equal strength , @xmath13 , the soi rotates electron spins around a single , fixed axis .",
    "the spin along this axis becomes conserved while spins along the perpendicular directions undergo a deterministic rotation that depends only on the starting and endpoints of their trajectory . in particular ,",
    "spins are not rotated along closed trajectories , therefore mesoscopic systems exhibit negative magnetoresistance when @xmath2 ,  @xcite i.e. weak localization and not weak antilocalization , just as if soi were absent .",
    "an effective spin randomization still occurs if the system is connected to many external transport channels , where uncertainties in the position of injection and exit translate into uncertainties in the spin rotation angle , unless injected electrons are prepared as spin - eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "( see , in particular , eq .",
    "( 7 ) therein ) spatially periodic modes in diffusive systems have been first described for the case of equal strengths @xmath13 , with spatial period given by the spin orbit length .",
    "these modes are long - lived for these particular soi strengths ( and in the absence of cubic soi ) and are thus referred to as persistent spin helix ,  @xcite _ i.e.  _ spin polarization waves with specific wavevectors @xmath14 .",
    "charge currents flowing through spin - orbit coupled diffusive metals can generate finite spin accumulations .",
    "@xcite this magnetoelectric effect achieves one of the main goals of spin - orbitronics  creating a steady - state , finite magnetization solely by applying an external electric field .",
    "the direction of polarization depends on the direction of the electric field and on the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "an electric field in @xmath15-direction leads to an accumulation in @xmath16- or @xmath17direction for linear rashba [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : rashbah ] ) ] or dresselhaus [ eq .  ( [ eq : dresselh ] ) ] interaction , respectively . the magnetoelectric effect in presence of both rashba and dresselhaus interaction has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite which predicted that the cisp is given by the uncorrelated sum of the two accumulations generated by the rashba and dresselhaus soi independently of one another .",
    "in particular , these predictions imply a finite accumulation at @xmath18 , whereas symmetry considerations ( to be discussed below ) require the vanishing of cisp at this point .",
    "this motivates us to revisit this issue .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we revisit the edelstein magnetoelectric effect in presence of both rashba and dresselhaus linear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "contrarily to refs .",
    "@xcite , we find that there is no cisp in any direction at @xmath19 . however , the spin accumulation of refs .",
    "@xcite is recovered at an infinitesimally small distance away from the singular point @xmath13 in infinite systems .",
    "our second goal is therefore , and perhaps more importantly , to figure out to what extent phenomena occurring specifically at @xmath13 are physically relevant . to that end , we consider three possible deviations from the treatment of magnetoelectric effects given in refs .",
    "@xcite in the form of ( i ) finite - size effects , ( ii ) the presence of a cubic dresselhaus interaction @xmath20 which is always there whenever a linear dresselhaus interaction is present , and ( iii ) an ac electric field .",
    "we find that spin accumulations are suppressed over parametric ranges given in each of these three instances by ( i ) @xmath5 which depends only on the linear system size @xmath3 , and not on the elastic mean free path @xmath8 , ( ii ) @xmath6 , and ( iii ) @xmath21 .",
    "there is a symmetry at @xmath13 that is responsible for the vanishing of the magnetoelectric effect . in order to expose that symmetry",
    ", we first note that a linear soi can be considered as a non - abelian su(2 ) gauge field with components @xmath22 the corresponding field strength has only two nonzero components , @xmath23=-m^2(\\alpha^2-\\beta^2)\\sigma_z \\ , .\\ ] ] they vanish for @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the rotated hamitonian given below in  eq.([eq : roth ] ) for @xmath24 and perform the unitary transformation @xmath25 to obtain @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "we thus see that the su(2 ) gauge field reduces to two conventional u(1 ) gauge fields in the hamiltonians @xmath28 .",
    "this u(1 ) field is a pure gauge field , implying vanishing spin conductance . to show this",
    ", one can for instance consider the linear response expression for the spin conductance in a two - terminal mesoscopic sample  @xcite @xmath29,\\ ] ] where the trace is over the spin degree of freedom , the integrals are performed over cross - sections @xmath30 of the two leads connecting the system to external terminals and the current operators @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we write @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the retarded ( advanced ) green s function of the system in the absence of soi . for @xmath2 ,",
    "one can gauge the soi field out of the current operators via the transformation @xmath35 which simultaneously gauges out the spin dependence of the green s function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmu ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37=0 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to see that this gauge argument also applies to cisp , since the latter is given by a formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmu ] ) , with the operator @xmath38 replaced by a pauli matrix .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : electr - induc - spin ] , we use spin- and charge coupled diffusion equations to calculate the spin accumulation generated by a charge current flowing in a bulk diffusive sample with rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions .",
    "this approach allows us to consider spin polarization in a finite size system ( sec .",

    "[ sec : ac - solution ] ) and in the presence of a cubic dresselhaus interaction ( sec .",

    "section iii presents numerical results on a tight - binding hamiltonian confirming our analytical predictions .",
    "a summary of our results and final comments are given in the conclusions section .",
    "we consider a disordered 2deg with non - interacting electrons of mass @xmath40 and charge @xmath41 .",

    "the interplay of disorder and soi is characterized by dimensionless parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) measuring the spin precession angle due to rashba and dresselhaus soi between two consecutive scatterings at impurities .",
    "our treatment presupposes @xmath61 , which ensures that spin distribution functions vary slowly everywhere across the sample .",
    "the coupled spin and charge excitations of the rashba / dresselhaus spin - orbit coupled 2d electron gas obey the following integral equation ( summation over doubly ",

    "we note the cancellation of the potentially singular @xmath74 factors in @xmath75 . for @xmath76",
    "the spin - charge couplings go to zero but this behavior seems to be cancelled by the diverging spin relaxation time to give finite spin accumulations at @xmath2 .",
    "however the same approach for @xmath66 set to @xmath53 from the outset produces vanishing spin accumulations .",
    "the main reason behind this inconsistency is that one spin relaxation time of the system diverges as @xmath76 .",
    "however , in a real , finite - sized system , the spin relaxation time is bounded from above by the typical time to escape to the leads .",
    "this is so , because leads provide spin ( and charge ) relaxation , which for @xmath13 becomes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism .",
    "finite - sized effects are thus expected to induce a smooth crossover to zero cisp as @xmath77 . in the next section ,",
    "we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "we assume a rectangular sample with soi attached to two external reservoirs defining the current direction , and bounded by vacuum otherwise .",
    "we obtain for the charge distribution function @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the fermi function .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions are that the spin accumulations vanish at the reservoirs and the normal component of the spin current vanishes at the hard wall boundaries  @xcite .    solving the diffusion equations we obtain the maximum spin accumulation within the soi region for an electric field along the @xmath15-direction :    [ s_an_finsize ] @xmath80    for a field in the @xmath16-direction",

    "( [ eq : charge - dens ] ) shows that the edelstein cisp goes smoothly to zero for @xmath2 , with the width of the crossover set solely by the system size , generating a singular behavior only as @xmath85 .",
    "the size of the crossover region is in particular independent of the mean free path @xmath8 , hence of the strength of the impurity potential , since in our regime , @xmath61 , the spin - orbit relaxation length is independent of disorder . away from @xmath13 ,",

    "this leads to smaller bulk spin accumulations and a longer spin relaxation length @xmath143 than the case in which the conditions @xmath61 and @xmath144 are completely fulfilled , and qualitatively explains the renormalization of the effective system length and the bulk spin accumulation .",

    "in this work we have studied the electrically induced and spin - orbit mediated spin accumulation in two - dimensional diffusive conductors with emphasis on finite - size and finite - frequency effects . in the thermodynamic limit of extended systems with ( linear ) rashba and dresselhaus soi the edelstein magnetoelectric effect gives rise to finite spin accumulation up to suppression at the singular point @xmath148 . however , in many experimentally relevant systems , additional time , respectively , energy scales come into play , such as in tranport ( i ) through mesoscopic samples of finite size , ( ii ) in the ac regime and ( iii ) through samples with cubic dresselhaus soi .",
    "we have shown , both analytically and numerically , that in these situations the singularity in the spin accumulation at @xmath148 is widened to a dip .",
    "this suppression of the spin accumulation over a finite @xmath106-range close to @xmath2 may have interesting implications with regard to other phenonema based on the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation mechanism . as but one consequence , finite - size effects may render the spin - field - effect transistor proposed in ref .   for @xmath148",
    "effectively operative even if the two linear soi are not precisely equal .",
    "this is so , because the spin rotation along two different trajectories with the same endpoints remains the same , even away from @xmath148 , if the trajectories are not too long .",
    "this is reflected in the finite width @xmath149 of the cisp lineshape given in eq .",
    "( [ s_an_finsize ] ) .",
    "furthermore , given that spin helices also emerge from eqs.([de0 ] ) and ( [ couplings ] )  @xcite , we conjecture that it is either finite - size effects or the presence of a cubic dresselhaus soi , or both , that render persistent spin helices excitable some distance away from @xmath2 , and thus experimentally observable .    while the present analysis is based on diffusive charge carrier motion , it would be interesting to investigate ballistic mesoscopic systems and see whether our results apply there or if our analysis has to be extended .",
