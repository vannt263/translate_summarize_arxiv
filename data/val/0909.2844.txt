    "the recent increased interest in the analysis of hydrodynamic disc flows is motivated , on one hand , by the study of turbulent processes , and , on the other , by the investigation of regular structure formation in protoplanetary discs .",
    "indeed , many astrophysical discs are thought to be neutral or having ionization rates too low to effectively couple with magnetic field . among these",
    "are cool and dense areas of protoplanetary discs , discs around young stars , x - ray transient and dwarf nova systems in quiescence ( see e.g. gammie and menou 1998 , sano et al .",
    "2000 , fromang , terquem and balbus 2002 ) .",
    "observational data shows that astrophysical discs often exhibit radial gradients of thermodynamic variables ( see e.g. sandin et al .",
    "2008 , issela et al .",
    "to what extent these inhomogeneities affect the processes occurring in the disc is still subject open to investigations .",
    "it has been found that strong local entropy gradients in the radial direction may drive the rossby wave instability ( lovelace et al .",
    "1999 , li et al . 2000 ) that transfers thermal to kinetic energy and leads to vortex formation .",
    "however , in astrophysical discs , radial stratification is more likely weak . in this case , the radial entropy ( temperature ) variation on the global scale leads to the existence of baroclinic perturbations over the barotropic equilibrium state .",
    "this more appropriate situation has recently become a subject of extensive study .",
    "klahr and bodenheimer ( 2003 ) pointed out that the radial stratification in the disc can lead to the global baroclinic instability .",
    "numerical results show that the resulting state is highly chaotic and transports angular momentum outwards .",
    "later klahr ( 2004 ) performed a local 2d linear stability analysis of a radially stratified flow with constant surface density and showed that baroclinic perturbations can grow transiently during a limited time interval .",
    "johnson and gammie ( 2005 ) derived analytic solutions for 3d linear perturbations in a radially stratified discs in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "they find that leading and trailing waves are characterized by positive and negative angular momentum flux , respectively .",
    "later johnson and gammie ( 2006 ) performed numerical simulations , in the local shearing sheet model , to test the radial convective stability and the effects of baroclinic perturbations .",
    "they found no substantial instability due to the radial stratification .",
    "this result reveals a controversy over the issue of baroclinic instability .",
    "presently , it seems that nonlinear baroclinic instability is an unlikely development in the local dynamics of sub - keplerian discs with weak radial stratification .",
    "potential vorticity production , and the formation and development of vortices in radially stratified discs have been studied by petersen et al .",
    "( 2007a , b ) by using pseudospectral simulations in the anelastic approximation .",
    "they show that the existence of thermal perturbations in the radially stratified disc flows leads to the formation of vortices . moreover , stronger vortices appear in discs with higher temperature perturbations or in simulations with higher reynolds numbers , and the transport of angular momentum may be both outward and inward .",
    "keplerian differential rotation in the disc is characterized by a strong velocity shear in the radial direction .",
    "it is known that shear flows are non - normal and exhibit a number of transient phenomena due to the non - orthogonal nature of the operators ( see e.g. trefethen et al .",
    "in fact , the studies described above did not take into account the possibility of mode coupling and energy transfer between different modes due to the shear flow induced mode conversion .",
    "mode coupling is inherent to shear flows ( cf .",
    "chagelishvili et al .",
    "1995 ) and often , in many respects , defines the role of perturbation modes in the system dynamics and the further development of nonlinear processes .",
    "thus , a correct understanding of the energy exchange channels between different modes in the linear regime is vital for a correct understanding of the nonlinear phenomena .",
    "indications of the shear induced mode conversion can be found in a number of previous studies .",
    "barranco and marcus 2005 report that vortices are able to excite inertial gravity waves during 3d spectral simulations .",
    "brandenburg and dintrans ( 2006 ) have studied the linear dynamics of perturbation sfh to analyze nonaxisymetric stability in the shearing sheet approximation .",
    "temporal evolution of the perturbation gain factors reveal a wave nature after the radial wavenumber changes sign .",
    "compressible waves are present , along with vortical perturbations , in the simulation by johnson & gammie ( 2005b ) but their origin is not particularly discussed .    in parallel",
    ", there are a number of papers that focus on the investigation of the shear induced mode coupling phenomena .",
    "the study of the linear coupling of modes in keplerian flows has been conducted in the local shearing sheet approximation ( tevzadze et al .",
    "2003,2008 ) as well as in 2d global numerical simulations ( bodo et al . 2005 , hereafter b05 ) .",
    "tevzadze et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the linear dynamics of three - dimensional small scale perturbations ( with characteristic scales much less then the disc thickness ) in vertically ( stably ) stratified keplerian discs .",
    "they show , that vortex and internal gravity wave modes are coupled efficiently .",
    "b05 performed global numerical simulations of the linear dynamics of initially imposed two - dimensional pure vortex mode perturbations in compressible keplerian discs with constant background pressure and density .",
    "the two modes possible in this system are effectively coupled : vortex mode perturbations are able to generate density - spiral waves .",
    "the coupling is , however , strongly asymmetric : the coupling is effective for wave generation by vortices , but not viceversa .",
    "the resulting dynamical picture points out the importance of mode coupling and the necessity of considering compressibility effects for processes with characteristic scales of the order or larger than the disc thickness .",
    "bodo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) extended this work to nonlinear amplitudes and found that mode coupling is an efficient channel for energy exchange and is not an artifact of the linear analysis .",
    "b05 is particularly relevant to the present study , since it studies the dynamics of mode coupling in 2d unstratified flows and is a good starting point for a further extension to radially stratified flows .",
    "later , heinemann & papaloizou ( 2009a ) derived wkbj solutions of the generated waves and performed numerical simulations of the wave excitation by turbulent fluctuations ( heinemann & papaloizou 2009b ) .",
    "in the present paper we study the linear dynamics of perturbations and analyze shear flow induced mode coupling in the local shearing sheet approximation .",
    "we investigate the properties of mode coupling using qualitative analysis within the three - mode approximation . within this approximation",
    "we tentatively distinguish vorticity , entropy and pressure modes .",
    "quantitative results on mode conversion are derived numerically .",
    "it seems that a weak radial stratifications , while being a weak factor for the disc stability , still provides an additional degree of freedom ( an active entropy mode ) , opening new options for velocity shear induced mode conversion , that may be important for the system behavior .",
    "one of the direct result of mode conversion is the possibility of linear generation of the vortex mode ( i.e. , potential vorticity ) by compressible perturbations .",
    "we want to stress the possibility of the coupling between high and low frequency perturbations , considering that high frequency oscillations have been often neglected during previous investigations in particular for protoplanetary discs .",
    "conventionally there are two distinct viewpoints commonly employed during the investigation of hydrodynamic astrophysical discs . in one case ( self gravitating galactic discs )",
    "the emphasis is placed on the investigation of the dynamics of spiral - density waves and vortices , although normally present in numerical simulations , are thought to play a minor role in the overall dynamics . in the other case ( non - self - gravitating hydrodynamic discs )",
    "the focus is on the potential vorticity perturbations and density - spiral waves are often thought to play a minor role . here , discussing the possible ( multi ) mode couplings , we want to draw attention to the possible flaws of these simplified views ( see e.g. mamatsashvili & chagelishvili 2007 ) .",
    "in many cases , mode coupling makes different perturbation to equally participate in the dynamical processes despite of a significant difference in their temporal scales .    in the next section we present mathematical formalism of our study .",
    "we describe three mode formalism and give schematic picture of the linear mode coupling in the radially sheared and stratified flow . numerical analysis of the mode coupling",
    "is presented in sec .",
    "we evaluate mode coupling efficiencies at different radial stratification scales of the equilibrium pressure and entropy .",
    "the paper is summarized in sec .",
    "the governing ideal hydrodynamic equations of a two - dimensional , compressible disc flows in polar coordinates are : @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the flow radial and azimuthal velocities respectively .",

    "the entropy can be calculated as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 is sometimes called potential temperature , while the physical entropy can be derived as @xmath22 .",
    "this equilibrium shows a deviation from the keplerian profile due to the radial stratification : @xmath23 @xmath24 hence , the described state is sub - keplerian or super - keplerian when the radial gradient of pressure is negative ( @xmath25 ) or positive ( @xmath26 ) , respectively .",
    "although these discs are non - keplerian , they are still rotationally supported , since the deviation from the keplerian profile is small : @xmath27 .",
    "we split the physical variables into mean and perturbed parts : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 in order to remove background trends from the perturbations we employ the global radial power law scaling for perturbed quantities : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    after the definitions one can get the following dynamical equations for the scaled perturbed variables : @xmath35 @xmath36 = 0 ~,\\ ] ] @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 = 0 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the squared sound speed at @xmath45 .",
    "let us introduce spatial fourier harmonics ( sfhs ) of perturbations with time dependent phases : @xmath64 @xmath65 with @xmath66    using the above expansion and eqs .",
    "( 27 - 30 ) , we obtain a compact ode system that governs the local dynamics of sfhs of perturbations : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 the potential vorticity : @xmath72 is a conserved quantity in barotropic flows : @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "the dispersion equation of our system can be obtained in the shearless limit ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) .",

    "@xmath80 , we find the frequencies are : @xmath81 @xmath82 high frequency solutions ( @xmath83 ) describe the density - spiral waves and will be referred later as the p - modes . low frequency solutions ( @xmath84 ) , instead , describe radial buoyancy mode due to the stratification . in barotropic flows ( @xmath85 ) this mode is degenerated into stationary zero frequency vortical solution . therefore , we may refer to it as a baroclinic mode .",
    "the mode describes instability when @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the equilibrium pressure and entropy gradients point in the same direction .",
    "klahr ( 2004 ) has anticipated such result , although worked in the constant surface density limit ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the same behavior has been obtained for axisymmetric perturbations in johnson and gammie ( 2005 ) . for comparison , in our model",
    "baroclinic perturbations are intrinsically non - axisymmetric .",
    "hence , our result obtained in the rigidly rotating limit shows that the local exponential stability of the radial baroclinic mode is defined by the schwarzschild - ledoux criterion : @xmath88    the dynamics of linear modes can be described using the modal equations for the eigenfunctions : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the eigenfunctions of the pressure and convective ( baroclinic ) modes , respectively .",

    "hence , we can fully derive the perturbation field of a specific mode individually by setting the eigenfunction of the other mode equal to zero .    as we will see later",
    ", the keplerian shear leads to the degeneracy of the convective buoyancy mode . in this case",
    "only the shear modified density - spiral wave mode eigenfunction can be employed in the analysis .",
    "it is well known that velocity shear introduces non - normality into the governing equations that significantly affects the dynamics of different perturbations . in this case",
    "we benefit from the shearing sheet transformation and seek the solutions in the form of the so - called kelvin modes .",
    "these originate from the vortical solutions derived in seminal paper by kelvin ( 1887 ) .",
    "in fact , as it was argued lately ( see e.g. , volponi and yoshida 2002 ) , the shearing sheet transformation leads to some sort of generalized modal approach .",
    "shear modes arising in such description differ from linear modes with exponential time dependence in many respects .",
    "primarily , phases of these continuous spectrum shear modes vary in time through shearing wavenumber ; their amplitudes can be time dependent ; and most importantly , they can couple in limited time intervals . on the other hand ,",
    "shear modes can be well separated asymptotically , where analytic wkbj solution for the each mode can be increasingly accurate . in the following , we will simply refer to these shearing sheet solution as `` modes '' .",
    "the character of shear flow effects significantly depend on the value of velocity shear parameter . to estimate the time - scales of the processes we compare the characteristic frequencies of the linear modes @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the velocity shear @xmath101 . in order to speak about the modification of the linear mode by the velocity shear ,",
    "the basic frequency of the mode should be higher than the one set by shear itself : @xmath102 . otherwise the modal solution can not be used to calculate perturbation dynamics , since perturbations will obey the shear induced variations at shorter timescales .    in quasi - keplerian",
    "differentially rotating discs with weak radial stratification : @xmath103 in this case the convective mode diverges from its modal behavior and is strongly affected by the velocity shear : the thermal and kinematic parts obey shear driven dynamics individually .",
    "therefore , we tentatively distinguish shear driven vorticity ( w ) and entropy ( s ) modes . on the contrary , the high frequency pressure mode is only modified by the action of the background shear .",
    "hence , we assume the above described three mode ( s , w and p ) formalism as the framework for our further study .    for the description of the p mode in differential rotation we define the function : @xmath104 where @xmath105 this can be considered as the generalization of the @xmath106 eigenfunction for the case of the shear flow , by accounting for the temporal variation of the radial wavenumber .",

    "see electronic edition of the journal for color images.,width=317 ]",
    "we have studied the dynamics of linear perturbations in a 2d , radially stratified , compressible , differentially rotating flow with different radial density , pressure and entropy gradients .",
    "we employed global radial scaling of linear perturbations and removed the algebraic modulation due to the background stratification .",
    "we derived a local dispersion equation for nonaxisymmetric perturbations and the corresponding eigenfunctions in the zero shear limit .",
    "we show that the local stability of baroclinic perturbations in the barotropic equilibrium state is defined by the schwarzschild - ledoux criterion .",
    "we study the shear flow induced linear coupling and the related possibility of the energy transfer between the different modes of perturbations using qualitative and a more detailed numerical analysis .",
    "we employ a three - mode formalism and describe the behavior of s w and p - modes under the action of the baroclinic and velocity shear forces in local approximation .",
    "we find that the system exhibits an asymmetric coupling pattern with five energy exchange channels between three different modes .",
    "the w - mode is coupled to s and p - modes : perturbations of the potential vorticity are able to excite entropy and compressible modes .",
    "the amplitude of the generated s - mode grows with the increase of entropy stratification scale of the background ( @xmath128 ) while the amplitude of the generated p - mode perturbations grows with the increase of background baroclinic index ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the s - mode is coupled to the w and p - modes : the amplitude of the generated p - mode perturbations grows with increase of the background pressure stratification scale ( @xmath130 ) , while the amplitude of the w - mode grows with the increase of baroclinic index .",
    "the p - mode is coupled to the s - mode : the amplitude of generated entropy perturbations grows with the increase of the background entropy stratification scale . on the other hand",
    ", there is no direct energy exchange channel from p to w mode and , therefore , no direct conversion is possible .",
    "our results , however , show that the p - mode is still able to generate w - mode through indirect three mode p - s - w coupling scheme .",
    "this linear inviscid mechanism indicates that compressible perturbations are able to generate potential vorticity via aperiodic entropy perturbations .",
    "the dynamics of radially stratified discs have been already studied by both , linear shearing sheet formalism and direct numerical simulations . however , previous studies focus on the baroclinic stability and vortex production by entropy perturbations , neglecting the coupling with higher frequency density waves .    the most vivid signature of density wave excitation in radially stratified disc flows can be seen in klahr ( 2004 ) .",
    "the numerical results presented on the linear dynamics of perturbation sfh show high frequency oscillations after the radial wavenumber changes sign .",
    "however , focusing on the energy dynamics , the author filters out high frequency oscillations from the analysis .",
    "the purpose of numerical simulations by johnson and gammie ( 2006 ) was the investigation of the velocity shear effects on the radial convective stability and the possibility of the development of baroclinic instability .",
    "therefore , no significant amount of compressible perturbations is present initially , and it is hard to judge if high frequency oscillations appear later in simulations .",
    "petersen et al . ( 2007a ) , ( 2007b ) employed the anelastic approximation that does not resolve the coupling of potential vorticity and entropy with density waves .",
    "moreover , if produced , high frequency density waves soon develop into spiral shocks ( see e.g. , bodo et al 2007 ) .",
    "the anelastic gas approximation does intentionally neglect this complication and simplifies the description down to low frequency dynamics .",
    "numerical simulations of hydrodynamic turbulence in unstratified disc flows showed that the dominant part of turbulent energy is accumulated into the high frequency compressional waves ( see , e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand , it is vortices that are thought to play a key role in hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion discs , as well as planet formation in protoplanetary disc dynamics",
    ". therefore , any link and possible energy exchange between high frequency compressible oscillations and aperiodic vortices can be an important factor in the above described astrophysical situations .    based on the present findings we speculate that density waves can participate in the process of the development of regular vortical structures in discs with negative radial entropy gradients .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that thermal ( entropy ) perturbations can generate vortices in baroclinic disc flows ( see e.g. , petersen et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "hence , vortex development through this mechanism depends on the existence of initial regular entropy perturbations , i.e. , thermal plumes , in differentially rotating baroclinic disc flows .",
    "it seems that compressional waves with linear amplitudes can heat the flow through two different channels : viscous dissipation and shear flow induced mode conversion .",
    "however , there is a strict difference between the entropy production by the kinematic shear mechanism and viscous dissipation . in the latter case , compressional waves first need to be tightly stretched down to the dissipation length - scales by the background differential rotation to be subject of viscous dumping . as a result",
    ", the entropy produced by viscous dissipation of compressional waves takes a shape of narrow stretched lines .",
    "this thermal perturbations can baroclinically produce potential vorticity of similar configuration . however , this is clearly not an optimal form of potential vorticity that can lead to the development of the long - lived vortical structures . on the contrary ,",
    "entropy perturbations produced through the mode conversion channel can have a form of a localized thermal plumes .",
    "these can be very similar to those used in numerical simulations by petersen et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , ( 2007b ) . in this case",
    "compressional waves can eventually lead to the development of persistent vortical structures of different polarity .",
    "hence , high frequency oscillations of the p mode can participate in the generation of anticyclonic vortices that further accelerate dust trapping and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary discs with equilibrium entropy decreasing radially outwards .",
    "using the local linear approximation we have shown the possibility of the potential vorticity generation in flows with both , positive and negative radial entropy gradients ( richardson numbers ) . in fact , the standard alpha description of the accretion discs implies _ positive _ radial stratification of entropy and hence , weak baroclinic decay of existing vortices . in this case",
    "there will be a competition between the `` baroclinic viscosity '' and potential vorticity generation due to mode conversion .",
    "hence , it is not strictly overruled that a significant amount of compressional perturbations can lead to the development of anticyclonic vortices even in flows with positive entropy gradients . in this case ,",
    "radial stratification opens an additional degree of freedom for velocity shear induced mode conversion to operate .",
    "although , the viability of this scenario needs further investigation .",
    "this paper presents the results obtained within the linear shearing sheet approximation . at nonlinear amplitudes",
    ", the p mode leads to the development of shock waves .",
    "these shocks induce local heating in the flow .",
    "therefore , a realistic picture of entropy production and vortex development in radially stratified discs with significant amount of compressible perturbations needs to be analyzed by direct numerical simulations .",
