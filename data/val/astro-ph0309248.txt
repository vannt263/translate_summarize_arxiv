    "the alignments of apsides and of nodes must simultaneously follow from a delicate balance of forces due to the gravitational field of the planet , ring self - gravity , and interparticle collisions . obtaining",
    "a complete equilibrium solution for a ring s three - dimensional geometry and mass distribution has been a goal of dynamicists for decades .",
    "the solution bears directly on ring ages and origins ( see , e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1979a ; chiang 2003 )",
    ".    the maxwell and colombo ringlets are saturnian analogs of the uranian @xmath0 and @xmath1 rings ( porco 1990 ) .",
    "the mean eccentricities of the saturnian ringlets , but not their mean inclinations , are measured from voyager spacecraft observations .",
    "table [ param ] summarizes observed ring parameters .",
    "shepherd satellites are expected to confine narrow rings and maintain the latter s sharp edges ( borderies , goldreich , & tremaine 1982 ) , but no satellite has yet been observed to accompany any of the aforementioned ringlets .",
    "this state of affairs promises to change with the arrival of the cassini spacecraft to saturn in 2004 .",
    "narrow rings and their attendant shepherds furnish the most accessible laboratories we have for studying disk - satellite interactions .",
    "their study informs problems on grander scales , including migration of planets within circumstellar disks ( see , e.g. , chiang 2003 ) .",
    "the steady - state condition of apsidal alignment , combined with measurements of the ring eccentricity profile , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the semi - major axis of a ring streamline , can be employed to calculate the ring surface density , @xmath11 .",
    "first attempts at this calculation account for the planetary quadrupole field and ring self - gravity , but omit the effects of interparticle collisions ( goldreich & tremaine 1979b , hereafter , the `` standard self - gravity model '' ) .",
    "chiang & goldreich ( 2000 , hereafter cg00 ) restore the latter effects to demonstrate how collisions near ring boundaries can dramatically raise the ring masses required for apsidal alignment .",
    "surface densities derived by accounting for pressure forces exceed those derived without pressure forces by 12 orders of magnitude ; the larger masses can be reconciled with occultation measurements and with classical theories of ring shepherding ( cg00 ) . a more careful treatment of pressure forces in the ring interior is undertaken by mosqueira & estrada ( 2002 ) , who reach the same qualitative conclusions as those of cg00 .",
    "all the works cited above consider only apsidal alignment and neglect nodal alignment .",
    "nodal alignment , but not apsidal alignment , is studied by borderies , goldreich , & tremaine ( 1983a ) , who consider ring self - gravity and planetary gravity , but neglect collisions .",
    "ring eccentricities are set to zero in their analysis .",
    "the ring s true surface density profile must be simultaneously reconciliable with both the alignment of apsides and the alignment of nodes ; the horizontal structure of a narrow ring is entwined with its vertical structure .",
    "this paper seeks to simultaneously treat apsidal and nodal alignment while accounting for the full panoply of forces due to the planetary quadrupole field , ring self - gravity , and interparticle collisions . in  [ equilibrium ] , we derive equilibrium ring surface densities and vertical geometries that lock the apsides and nodes of a given ring . we apply our solutions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 rings of uranus , and the maxwell and colombo ringlets of saturn . in  [ stability ] , we present a proof that circular , nodally locked rings are linearly stable to perturbations to their inclinations and nodes .",
    "the beginnings of such a proof can be found in borderies , goldreich , & tremaine ( 1983b ) ; here , we state the arguments more completely and explicitly . in  [ discussion ] , we discuss our results , highlighting the future impact of the cassini spacecraft on studies of narrow rings and unresolved theoretical issues .",
    "our procedure for deriving the mass and 3-dimensional structure of a narrow ring is summarized as follows . the range of semi - major axes spanned by the ring , the eccentricity profile [ @xmath9 ] , and the mean inclination ( @xmath6 ) are assumed to be given . from @xmath9 , we compute the surface density profile , @xmath13 , by enforcing apsidal alignment across the ring and by accounting for planetary oblateness , ring self - gravity , and interparticle collisions . this computation is described in detail in  [ surf ] .",
    "next , from @xmath13 and @xmath6 , we compute the inclination profile , @xmath14 , by enforcing nodal alignment across the ring and by accounting for planetary oblateness and ring self - gravity but not interparticle collisions .",
    "the computation of @xmath14 is described in  [ inca ] . finally , in ",
    "[ check ] , we gauge _ a posteriori _ the extent to which our neglect of collisional stresses in the derivation of @xmath14 is justified .",
    "our computational procedure assumes the ring is characterized by a time - independent argument of pericenter , @xmath15 .",
    "this means the narrowest portion of the ring ( its pericenter ) lies at a fixed angle relative to the ring s node on the equator plane of the planet . strictly speaking",
    ", the assumption of stationary @xmath15 is invalid , since    @xmath16    the common precession rate of the longitude of pericenter of all apsidally aligned streamlines , @xmath17 , is set by the quadrupole field of the central planet and is positive ( in the direction of increasing true anomaly ) .",
    "the common precession rate of the longitude of ascending node of all nodally aligned streamlines , @xmath18 , is also set by the planetary quadrupole field , is identical in magnitude to @xmath17 , and is negative .",
    "that @xmath19 implies that the pericenter of the ring circulates relative to the node on the planet s equator plane ; since self - gravitational forces are largest at pericenter , the contribution to differential nodal precession from ring self - gravity can not be time - independent .",
    "our hope is that this complication does not introduce serious errors into our calculation of the time - averaged ring geometry ; we point out below where our assumption of fixed argument of pericenter is employed , explore in a preliminary but quantitative manner the consequences of its violation in the appendix , and speculate about its true effects in the discussion section (  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "we divide the ring into a set of @xmath20 wires and compute the mass of each wire by imposing the steady - state condition of apsidal alignment .",
    "the @xmath20 wires are equally spaced in semi - major axis ; @xmath21 wires lie at semi - major axes smaller than that of the ring midline , and @xmath21 wires lie at greater semi - major axes .",
    "our calculation differs from that of cg00 only in the treatment of collisional forces .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to describing this difference ; for background details , see cg00 .",
    "cg00 highlight the importance of interparticle collisions at ring boundaries and account crudely for their effects by introducing force terms in the equations of motion for `` endwires '' located within a collisional mean free path , @xmath22 , of either ring boundary .",
    "no account is made of collisional stresses in the ring interior ( regions displaced many mean free paths from either boundary ) in the quantitative model they present .",
    "here we improve upon their calculation by making such an account , although still in a crude and prescriptive manner .",
    "we take the solution of cg00 for @xmath13 and derive from it a collisional acceleration everywhere within the ring :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 points in the radial direction , @xmath25 is the dimensionless eccentricity gradient , and @xmath26 measures true anomaly .",
    "the factor @xmath27 is proportional to the local radial spacing between wires ( see , e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1979b ) . following cg00 , we adopt a constant @xmath28 across the entire ring .",
    "the velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , and a dimensionless factor , @xmath30 , are described as follows .",
    "we prescribe the following profile for the square of the velocity dispersion ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the same constants as employed by cg00 , and @xmath35 is the semi - major axis of the ring boundary that is nearest a given wire at @xmath10 . according to ( [ collprescrip ] )",
    ", the velocity dispersion decreases from either ring boundary towards the ring interior over a lengthscale @xmath36 .",
    "the physics underlying the enhancement of velocity dispersion near ring boundaries is elucidated by borderies , goldreich , & tremaine ( 1982 ) and estimates for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 are derived by cg00 .",
    "the actual values we employ are contained in table [ param2 ] .",
    "the function    @xmath37}\\ ] ]    is a softening parameter that we impose because the true acceleration due to particle collisions near a ring boundary is likely overestimated by the usual hydrodynamic expression for the acceleration due to pressure gradients [ @xmath38 . within",
    "a few mean free paths , @xmath39@xmath22 , of the ring edge , the hydrodynamic approximation breaks down and particles behave more ballistically with less regard for large - scale gradients in the surface density .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 quickly grows from @xmath40 to unity as we recede from the ring edge towards the ring midline .",
    "the collisional acceleration , @xmath41 , is inserted into gauss s equation for a given ring particle s apsidal precession rate , @xmath42 , and averaged over true anomaly to yield , for a given wire , @xmath43 . this collisional contribution to the wire s precession rate",
    "adds to other contributions due to planetary oblateness and inter - wire gravity .",
    "expressions for the latter two contributions are supplied by cg00 .",
    "the condition of apsidal alignment requires that precession rates of all wires be equal to the precession rate of a test particle at the ring midline , and yields @xmath20 linear equations for the @xmath20 wire masses .",
    "the solution of this linear system generates a new surface density profile , @xmath44 .",
    "the entire calculation is then repeated : from this new surface density , we calculate a new collisional acceleration profile [ @xmath45 , a new set of wire precession rates due to pressure forces [ @xmath46 , and a new set of @xmath20 linear equations .",
    "in this way , the solution for the surface density is iterated until convergence is achieved .    in practice , for model parameters appropriate to the uranian @xmath0 and @xmath1 rings and the saturnian maxwell and colombo ringlets ( see table [ param2 ] ) , we find that the solution of @xmath476000 wire masses converges after @xmath3910 iterations . because the solution is reflection - symmetric about the ring midline , only @xmath483000 linearly independent equations need be solved for @xmath21 distinct wire masses .",
    "the derivative in equation ( [ collacc ] ) is computed numerically using a savitzky - golay smoothing filter of order 2 and having a width of 20 wires ( press et al .",
    "the system of @xmath20 linear equations is solved using subroutine dgesv of the lapack ( linear algebra package ) software library . because many of our parameters such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 are only order - of - magnitude estimates , our profiles are probably accurate to factors of a few , at best .",
    "nevertheless , by accounting not only for interparticle collisions near ring boundaries but also for collisions within the ring interior , we may explore the qualitative effects of incorporating the latter and make a first - cut correction to the solutions obtained by cg00 .    computed surface density profiles for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , maxwell , and colombo ringlets are displayed in figures 14 , respectively . near the ring midline , our solutions require less mass than those of cg00 , a consequence of local pressure gradients that compress the ring and abet ring self - gravity .",
    "by contrast , our computed peaks in surface density near ring boundaries are larger than those of cg00 .",
    "the reason for this is as follows . as a given peak in surface density",
    "is approached from the ring midline , steep and inward - directed pressure forces must be balanced by the outward gravitational attraction of massive endwires on the far side of the peak .",
    "these inward - directed forces are neglected by cg00 ; accounting for them here leads to endwire masses larger than those obtained by cg00 .",
    "these same qualitative conclusions are reached by mosqueira & estrada ( 2002 ) , who employ various prescriptions for collisional stresses that differ from ours .",
    "their surface density profiles deviate from ours by large amounts , sometimes by more than an order of magnitude , reflecting the sensitivity of the shape of the profile to choice of boundary conditions .",
    "some consolation may be had in the finding of mosqueira & estrada ( 2002 ) that the total ring mass , @xmath49 , is less sensitive to this choice .",
    "the chief shortcoming of all calculations of the surface density profile , including our own , is the prescriptive and slightly arbitrary description of the ring boundary .",
    "we have assumed here that @xmath50 is constant across the entire ring , even in boundary regions resonantly perturbed by shepherd satellites where streamlines can no longer be described as simple ellipses .",
    "see cg00 for a discussion of this point .      given @xmath6 and @xmath13 , we compute @xmath14 by imposing the steady - state condition of nodal alignment .",
    "we now discretize the ring into @xmath51 wires that share the same longitude of ascending node and solve for the orbital inclination of each wire with respect to the equator plane of the planet . note that whereas the calculation of the surface density in  [ surf ] employs an even number of wires ( @xmath20 ) , here we employ an odd number for the calculation of the inclination profile .",
    "the reason for this change of procedure is to have the @xmath52 wire lie on the ring midline and to assign @xmath53 . with this reference point",
    "defined , the inclinations of the @xmath54 wires that lie to one side of the midwire may then be computed .",
    "inclinations of the @xmath54 wires that lie on the other side of the midwire follow from reflection anti - symmetry about the midwire .",
    "the nodal precession rate of the @xmath55 wire relative to that of a particle on the ring midline and due to the quadrupole field of the central planet is given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the semi - major axis and mean motion , respectively , of a particle on the ring midline , @xmath59 is the usual dimensionless measure of the planetary quadrupole field , @xmath60 is the planetary radius , and @xmath61 denotes a time - average over one orbit . here",
    "@xmath62 runs from 1 ( the wire closest to the planet ) to @xmath51 ( the wire furthest from the planet ) .",
    "the corresponding differential nodal precession rate due to inter - wire gravity is    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    @xmath65 is the mass of the planet , @xmath66 is the mass of the @xmath67 wire , and @xmath68 is a dimensionless function of order unity that depends on the eccentricity profile of the ring , the inclination profile ( @xmath69 ) , and the arguments of pericenters of the various wires . following our assumption of a time - independent @xmath15 ( see the discussion preceding  [ surf ] ) , we will take @xmath70 constant .",
    "though @xmath68 actually varies with time because @xmath19 , its maximum range of variation is less than a factor of 2 , as we derive in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath21 distinct wire masses computed in  [ surf ] furnish the set of @xmath71 used in equation ( [ igrav ] ) from @xmath72 to @xmath21 ; the remaining @xmath54 wire masses are assigned by reflection symmetry across the ring midline .",
    "steady nodal alignment implies    @xmath73    where we have neglected the contribution from interparticle collisions ; the validity of this omission is tested in  [ check ] . embedded in equation ( [ masterinc ] ) are @xmath54 independent equations for the @xmath54 distinct values of @xmath74 .",
    "we proceed to massage equation ( [ masterinc ] ) into a form that permits easy solution .",
    "a dimensionless form of the @xmath55 sub - equation reads    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the total width of the ring near quadrature , and @xmath77 is the fraction of the ring s total mass contained in wire @xmath78 .",
    "now each @xmath79 is a linear combination of the @xmath54 independent variables ,    @xmath80    as in    @xmath81    furthermore , for ring self - gravity to balance the planetary quadrupole field , the inclination profile must be reflection anti - symmetric about the ring midline . then    @xmath82    and if @xmath83 and @xmath84 , then    @xmath85    it is straightforward to show that by virtue of identities ( [ ident1])([ident3 ] ) , the summation in equation ( [ master2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath86 as    @xmath87 \\\\",

    "the set of inclinations , @xmath89 , are derived from @xmath90 via ( [ def ] ) .",
    "figures [ alphainc ] and [ betainc ] summarize the results of our calculation for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 rings of uranus .",
    "these are the only narrow rings whose mean inclinations , @xmath6 , have been measured .",
    "we predict inclination profiles that are much flatter than those predicted by the standard self - gravity model .",
    "the larger ring masses that arise from the inclusion of interparticle collisions enable rings to maintain nodal alignment by warping their geometry by relatively small amounts .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of the warp , defined as @xmath91 , is @xmath397 meters for the @xmath0 ring and @xmath393 meters for the @xmath1 ring .",
    "by contrast , the standard self - gravity model , which employs wire masses derived without regard to interparticle collisions , predicts warp amplitudes of order 1 km .",
    "figures [ maxwellinc ] and [ titaninc ] describe inclination profiles for the maxwell and colombo ringlets of saturn .",
    "the mean inclinations , @xmath6 , of these rings with respect to the local laplacian plane have not been measured .",
    "fortunately , we have found by numerical experiment that the _ fractional _ variation of inclination across the ring , @xmath92 , is independent of the mean inclination .",
    "the top panels of figures [ maxwellinc ] and [ titaninc ] should therefore be fairly accurate .",
    "numerical experiment also reveals that the _ absolute _ value of the warp across the ring , @xmath91 , scales linearly with the unknown @xmath6 ; in computing the absolute value of the warp for the bottom panels , we have simply guessed @xmath93 rad for both rings , values comparable to their observed mean eccentricities .",
    "note that vertical warping is substantially greater for the saturnian maxwell and colombo rings than for the uranian @xmath0 and @xmath1 rings .",
    "accounting for interparticle collisions near ring edges always increases ring masses and flattens ring warps , but such effects become less important as the ring width increases .",
    "the maxwell and titan rings are each more than 25 km across at quadrature , while their uranian counterparts are less than 7 km across .",
    "collisional stresses near ring edges are not as effectively communicated across wider rings .",
    "we check _ a posteriori _ the validity of our approximation in  [ inca ] that interparticle collisions play no direct role in determining the inclination profile .",
    "collisions matter most near ring edges ( cg00 ) ; an upper limit for the collisional acceleration felt by a ring particle lying with a mean free path , @xmath94 , of the ring edge is @xmath95 .",
    "the component of this acceleration that is perpendicular to the orbit plane of this last ring particle is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the inclination gradient evaluated at the edge .",
    "this normal acceleration generates a rate of nodal precession ( relative to the collision - induced rate on the ring midline , which is zero ) of @xmath39@xmath98 .",
    "we divide this maximum , collision - induced differential precession rate by the differential rate of this last endwire due to the quadrupole field of the planet . for collisions to be unimportant",
    ", this dimensionless number should be less than unity . for the uranian @xmath0 ring ,",
    "it is    @xmath99    where the value for @xmath100 at the ring edge is obtained from our computed inclination profile .",
    "for the @xmath1 ring , we derive @xmath101 ; for both the saturnian maxwell and colombo ( titan ) ringlets , @xmath102 .",
    "note that these values of @xmath103 for the saturnian ringlets are independent of the assumed @xmath6 since @xmath104 is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "we conclude based on these smallish values of @xmath103 that collisions are of marginal direct importance to the inclination profiles of our ring models .",
    "as we recede from the ring edge towards the ring interior , collisions become even less important as surface density gradients decline .",
    "here we prove that circular , nodally locked ringlets are linearly stable to perturbations to their inclinations and nodes . a corresponding proof for the stability of apsidally locked , co - planar rings would read similarly .",
    "we account not only for ring self - gravity and the planetary quadrupole field , but also for interparticle collisions , albeit in a simplistic way .",
    "we restrict ourselves to circular rings for simplicity and for this proof only .",
    "our hope is that accounting simultaneously for ring eccentricity would not change our conclusions .",
    "while this hope must be tempered by considerations of a time - varying @xmath15 that we have not explored in depth , we take some consolation from the appendix in which we show how a variable @xmath15 impacts force balance in the vertical direction by seemingly modest amounts .    in  [ onewire ]",

    "the two remaining constants are @xmath202 and @xmath6 , where @xmath202 is set by the mean longitude of ascending node . equations ( [ c_mx ] ) and ( [ c_my ] ) imply that an inclined , circular ring responds to small perturbations to the inclinations and nodes of its constituent ringlets in the presence of self - gravity , planetary oblateness , and ( a simplified prescription of ) interparticle collisions by oscillating in a number of normal modes .",
    "these modes resemble the vibrations of a string with free boundary conditions and variable density .",
    "a preliminary numerical study in which we modelled the ring with @xmath203 suggests that the fundamental ( lowest , non - zero ) frequency is    @xmath204    where @xmath205 is the full width of the ring . for this mode , half the ring precesses nodally in one direction relative to the ring midline , while the other half precesses in the other direction . for the maxwell ringlet , @xmath206 yr .",

    "we will use this numerical model in our discussion below regarding the possibility of exciting a high order mode by using force variations that arise from a time - varying @xmath15 ( see also the appendix ) .",
    "our crude and prescriptive treatment of streamline dynamics near resonantly perturbed ring boundaries prevents us from claiming great accuracy in our computed surface density and inclination profiles . nonetheless , we believe the following conclusions to be robust :    1 .",
    "narrow rings have total masses of order @xmath209 .",
    "2 .   their surface densities increase towards their edges .",
    "the uranian @xmath0 and @xmath1 rings are vertically warped by a height of order 10 m. the radially wider saturnian maxwell and titan rings are warped by a height of order 1 ( @xmath210 ) km .",
    "an equivalent and more model - independent statement is that the fractional variation of inclination is order @xmath211 across the uranian ringlets and of order @xmath212 across their saturnian analogues .",
    "nodally ( apsidally ) locked rings are linearly stable to perturbations to their inclinations ( eccentricities ) and nodes ( apses ) .",
    "analysis of stellar occultation data by the cassini spacecraft may test predictions 13 for the maxwell and colombo ringlets of saturn .    for a ring to maintain apsidal and nodal alignment , its argument of pericenter",
    "must precess .",
    "this means that where the ring is `` pinched''in other words , its pericenter , the narrowest portion of the ring , where self - gravitational and collisional forces are strongest  circulates relative to the node of the ring on the equator plane of the planet . such circulation must introduce time - variable forces into the vertical equations of motion for the ring ; these time - variable forces have a frequency of @xmath213 , or about 0.08 cycles per day for the saturn maxwell ringlet .",
    "might these time - variable forces drive bending waves across the ring ?",
    "first note that the driving frequency is more than 2 orders of magnitude greater the fundamental bending frequency , @xmath214 .",
    "therefore any mode that is excited will have a wavelength considerably shorter than the overall width of the ring .",
    "a preliminary study suggests that the radial wavelength of the bending mode whose natural frequency matches the driving frequency is of order one kilometer for the saturnian ringlets , a length scale possibly within reach of the cassini camera .",
    "we defer a more thorough investigation of this possibility , including estimates of the amplitude of the mode , to future study . in the event that cassini finds the vertical structure of a narrow ring to vary over a period of a few weeks and over kilometer lengthscales",
    ", one might look to the periodic stresses associated with a time - varying @xmath15 for the cause .",
    "ultimately , measurements and a theoretical understanding of any modes excited might constrain the mass of the ring independently of optical depth soundings .",
    "we have solved for the inclination gradient of a given ring by first finding the surface density profile .",
    "a key input for this procedure was the eccentricity profile of the ring , @xmath9 , which we obtained from the ( spatially averaged ) observations .",
    "while this procedure is physically self - consistent , it begs the question of where the eccentricity profile originated .",
    "another way of saying this is to note that our equilibrium solutions are not the only ones possible in principle . for example , the steps of our procedure could be reversed : we could begin by positing an inclination gradient , solve next for the masses required to maintain nodal alignment , and conclude by deriving the eccentricity gradient required to maintain apsidal alignment .",
    "we did not adopt this procedure because the observations supplied the eccentricity gradient and not the inclination gradient .",
    "why narrow rings self - organize themselves to exhibit dimensionless eccentricity gradients of order @xmath215 and dimensionless inclination gradients that are significantly smaller  of order @xmath216@xmath211 for the saturnian cases and of order @xmath211@xmath217 for the uranian cases  is unclear .",
    "many issues remain unresolved in our understanding of narrow rings . in the more than twenty years since their discovery",
    ", we still ask the following questions :    1 .",
    "are narrow rings primordial ? according to classical theories of ring shepherding , attendant satellites extend the viscous spreading time of a ring by a factor of order the mass ratio between the shepherd and the ring .",
    "this extension factor is modest for the uranian @xmath218 ring , whose mass is thought to be comparable to that of its shepherds ( cg00 ) .",
    "the situation is likely to be similar for other rings , especially given the large ring masses that we are deriving .",
    "estimates for the spreading time of the @xmath218 ring range from @xmath219 yr to @xmath220 yr , all of which are shorter than the age of the solar system ( chiang 2003 ) .",
    "but if narrow rings are not formed from primordial circumplanetary disks , how can we explain the tiny mean inclinations exhibited by the uranian rings with respect to the equator plane of their severely oblique host planet ?",
    "new estimates of ring lifetimes based on non - classical theories of shepherding ( see , e.g. , goldreich & porco 1987 , and borderies , goldreich , & tremaine 1984 ) would be welcome .",
    "2 .   why do all narrow rings exhibit positive and not negative eccentricity gradients ?",
    "why is the inclination gradient smaller in magnitude than the eccentricity gradient ?",
    "we might hope to answer these questions by modelling more carefully the distortion of streamlines near ring edges by shepherd satellites .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank joanne cohn for introducing c.j.c . to e.i.c .",
    "we thank also carolyn porco for faxing pages from her thesis to us , and an anonymous referee for a helpful report that prompted us to examine our statements regarding bending modes more carefully .",

    "here we explore the effect of a time - varying argument of pericenter , @xmath15 , on our equation of motion ( [ igrav ] ) for nodal precession in the presence of ring self - gravity .",
    "consider two elliptical wires orbiting a spherical planet , one placed in an arbitrary reference plane , and a second placed at an inclination , @xmath221 , relative to that plane .",
    "take the longitudes of pericenter of the two wires to be equal , @xmath222 .",
    "the longitude of ascending node of the second wire is @xmath110 .",
    "how sensitive is the orbit - averaged rate of nodal precession of the second wire , @xmath223 , to @xmath224 ?        where we have assumed that the difference in semi - major axes of the wires , @xmath205 , is much smaller than the semi - major axis of either wire , @xmath10 .",
