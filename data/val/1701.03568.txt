    "in wireless ad hoc networks the participating nodes typically engage in group communication such as broadcasting , multiple - access , or relaying operations , where more than two nodes may be simultaneously involved .",
    "these sophisticated protocols are motivated by mission - critical goals such as achieving high - throughput , or supporting resource - constrained nodes ( such as bandwidth and power ) in the network . in order to secure group communication from external eavesdroppers , the nodes use group secret keys ( gsks ) to exchange confidential data , and are also involved in key management tasks such as key generation , distribution and maintenance @xcite .",
    "while strengthening the security of key management is an evolving research field , researchers are concurrently focussing on methods to dynamically generate secret keys by exploiting randomness available in the environment .",
    "the purpose of dynamic key generation is either to use it as an independent recipe of generating keys , or to use it to update the existing keys .",
    "dynamic key generation techniques are well known , and have been particularly well studied in the context of wireless two - user physical - layer key generation ( pkg ) @xcite . in pkg , the two participants observe a common source of randomness to generate a common key without leaking information to an external passive eavesdropper .",
    "although , the sources of randomness are innumerable , easily accessible ones are the variations in the wireless channel strengths , such as the received signal strength indicator ( rssi ) values , complex baseband signal samples , and the channel estimates .",
    "other than the concept of generating secret - keys for two nodes that are within radio frequency ( rf ) range , some works @xcite-@xcite have also addressed using third - party relay(s ) to assist the secret - key generation between nodes that are out of range .    a generalization of relay - assisted secret - key sharing is the concept of wireless physical - layer group secret key ( gsk ) generation , wherein a group of nodes in the network generate a secret key by observing a common source of randomness @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "unlike two - user wireless pkg , in gsk generation , nodes in the group exchange additional messages apart from the pilots so that all the nodes witness the common source of randomness .",
    "gsk generation is applicable in ad hoc wireless networks that operate in mobile environments , e.g. , manets and vanets @xcite .",
    "existing works on gsk have focused on developing protocols for exchanging messages so as to ( i ) reduce the latency , and ( ii ) to secure the generated keys from an external eavesdropper @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . also , the models assume trusted group members and secure the communication against passive eavesdroppers and active attacks from external nodes . in this work , we deviate at this point , to not to discard the possibility of the presence of insiders that involve in active attacks , that disturb the key generation process . in particular , we incorporate the possibility that some legitimate nodes might be compromised ( for e.g. , as in @xcite ) , and the attackers might enter the system as insiders before the commencement of key generation .",
    "our specific contributions are :    * we introduce a novel threat model with insider - compromise , that prior works have not considered .",
    "some crude attacks in our model are to stop relaying signals in the key - generation process , or to inject noise into the system , or to prevent the neighbouring nodes in achieving consensus on the group secret key .",
    "we , however , consider more sophisticated attacks that enable the attacker to manipulate the key generation process and yet go undetected .",
    "more specifically , we have proposed the following two types of attacks : ( i ) different - key attacks , wherein an insider attempts to force different realizations of key at different nodes , especially in a network when the legitimate nodes do not have private channels to verify the attack ( for e.g. , in chain - topology based networks @xcite ) , and ( ii ) low - rate key attacks , wherein an insider attempts to slow down the channel variations over time , in order to reduce the _ secret - key rate _ , which is a measure of how fast the generated keys can be updated ( section [ sec : threat_model ] ) . * to detect the above attacks , one can envision a scheme that uses a separate communication channel built on neighbour discovery and explicit pair - wise communication with the legitimate neighbours ; however , such a straightforward scheme introduces new sets of vulnerabilities and can be expensieve in terms of communication - overhead .",
    "therefore , we apply detection schemes that are based on standard phy - layer techniques such as measuring average power levels and doppler spread ( variations of channel over time ) @xcite to identify anomalies and inconsistencies .",
    "we show that the proposed insider - attacks can go undetected on the state - of - the - art gsk generation schemes with a non - negligible rate despite using off - the - shelf channel measurement techniques .",
    "this implies that gsk generation schemes are vulnerable to insider - threats , especially on topologies that can not support additional secure links between neighbouring nodes to verify the attacks .",

    "further , the network topology is assumed to be fixed over several blocks of coherence intervals .    in the above network model ,",
    "the nodes intend to generate a gsk by observing an accessible and secure source of common randomness . unlike two - node physical - layer key generation , which requires a minimum of two rounds of pilot exchanges , the multi - node generalization requires more exchanges ;",

    "the common source of randomness is some function @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "since each node can broadcast its pilot to a maximum of two nodes , some nodes need to forward their observations so that all the nodes witness @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the coherence time @xmath6 is longer than one round of the gsk generation protocol . a generic protocol for exchanging the observations is given below :    * for @xmath19 * * for @xmath20 * * * node @xmath12 broadcasts pilot symbol(s ) , which are used by the rest of the nodes in its rf range to learn the corresponding channel estimates . + end * * depending on the target @xmath21 , the nodes exchange their acquired set of channel estimates , one after the other until each node learns @xmath22 .",
