    "e.g. @xcite and references therein , we discussed in various aspects the mechanics of affinely - rigid bodies , i.e. , bodies rigid in the sense of affine geometry .",
    "being interesting in themselves even from the purely academic point of view of analytical mechanics , they were also thought on as a useful model of internal and collective degrees of freedom of various realistic systems .",
    "everything done in the mentioned papers concerned a single affine body ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .        fig .",
    "1 . affine body , degrees of freedom .",
    "it is interesting , however , to investigate the mechanics of systems of such bodies .",
    "certain quite realistic physical applications are obvious .",
    "for example , in various problems of molecular dynamics the most relevant degrees of freedom are spatial translations , rotations and homogeneous deformations .",
    "these are so - to - speak the leading modes of motion of a single molecule . in molecular crystals one deals with aggregates , systems of such objects ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .        fig .",
    "2 . molecular crystal or granular medium as a system of spheres or spheroids .",
    "atoms in a single molecule are strongly coupled to each other , whereas the mutual coupling between separate molecules is relatively weak .",
    "so , molecules have a well - defined individuality and the model of a system of mutually interacting affinely - rigid bodies looks physically reasonable and viable . in the long - wave approximation one",
    "obtains asymptotically the micromorphic continuum in the sense of eringen @xcite .",
    "this is the continuum of infinitesimal affinely - rigid bodies , consisting of material points with attached linear frames representing internal degrees of freedom , i.e. , microrotations and microdeformations if using the terms accepted in theory of micropolar and micromorphic media . in the droplet model of nuclei the collective phenomena are also sometimes described in terms of affine degrees of freedom @xcite ; the nuclei - nuclei interaction also may be interpreted in terms of systems of affine grains - droplets .",
    "there are vibrating stars and other astrophysical objects .",
    "as shown by riemann , dedekind , chandrasekhar and others , their relevant , leading , degrees of freedom in a good approximation are also ruled by the affine group .",
    "so , for example , a double star , at least when its constituents are placed relatively near to each other , is a system of mutually interacting affine bodies        fig .",
    "densely packed grains : microcontinua ?    in all those examples ( molecular crystals are perhaps most suggestive , but amorphous media also provide a good example , cf .",
    "3 ) the mutual displacements result in stresses and the mutual rotations and deformations lead to hyperstresses ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . there is also another application , strongly related to the finite element method .",
    "as known , this method was elaborated primarily for the computational , numerical purposes .",
    "the material body is `` triangulated '' like in geodesy and represented as an aggregate of simplexes which are so small that in a good approximation they may be considered as homogeneously deformable , i.e. , as affine bodies ( according to the very idea of differential calculus , every sufficiently regular configuration may be in sufficiently small regions approximated by affine ones ) .",
    "the boundary surface of the body may be then literally triangulated into two - dimensional , i.e. , planar affine bodies , the surface finite elements . in traditional applications",
    "all these simplexes were used as elements of the mesh for the purely numerical solving of partial differential equations of elasticity ( or viscoelasticity , plasticity , etc . ) .",
    "but nowadays another approach became fashionable , namely one combining in an inventive way rigorous analytical , qualitative and numerical methods @xcite . by introducing the simplex",
    "mesh one represents the body as an aggregate of mutually interacting small affine bodies .",
    "grains of the regular lattice become translated , rotated and deformed .    the continuous dynamical problem based on partial differential equations",
    "is then approximated by a discrete one , ruled by a finite system of ordinary differential equations with time as the only independent variable @xcite .",
    "obviously , this reduction to analytical mechanics with a finite number of degrees of freedom is an approximation , the better one , the mesh is more dense and inventive .",
    "but one can think about combining the well - elaborated methods of the theory of finite - dimensional dynamical systems , both rigorously analytical and qualitative ones , with the numerical techniques based on the discretization .",
    "the procedure becomes then more reliable and the danger of computer artefacts is remarkably smaller than when dealing with the purely mesh - based numerical treatment of dynamical partial equations @xcite .",
    "there is also another problem on a more fundamental level .",
    "namely , one can think that in certain situations the simplicial - triangulation modes of motion may be more adequate than , e.g. , the usual phononic modes corresponding to the fourier expansion onto plane waves . in any case",
    "this is some reasonable alternative approach .",
    "incidentally , when we go with the size of simplicial elements to the nano - scale , the quantum treatment becomes necessary , just like in the traditional phonon - modes description .",
    "even if assumed models of mutual interactions ( described , e.g. , by binary potential ) are formally simple , it is rather a rule than exception that , both computationally and qualitatively , the mechanics of a system of material points is much more complicated than the mechanics of a single material point moving in some fixed external field . the situation becomes even incomparatively more difficult when our elementary entities are no longer material points but structured objects , e.g. , rigid bodies or affinely - rigid bodies .",
    "this fact is well known even in relatively simple systems of mutually coupled gyroscopes .",
    "the nontrivial geometry and topology of `` internal '' degrees of freedom brings about some completely new problems and difficulties , even on the very fundamental level of invariance principle .",
    "although the objects move in the flat affine or euclidean space ( here we consider only such a situation as realistic ) , the full configuration space is non - euclidean .",
    "when we deal with systems , this leads to really serious complications like difficulty if not impossibility at all of defining correctly the internal motion `` as a whole '' ( some `` average '' internal motion of the system ) and the `` relative '' internal motions .",
    "this is similar and as a matter of fact geometrically strongly related to the impossibility of the correct definition of the centre of mass for a system of material points in a curved ( riemannian ) space .",
    "there is also another important novelty when we pass from mechanics of a single object moving in a lie group as the configuration space ( euclidean , affine , orthogonal , linear ) to a system , i.e. , when the configuration space becomes the cartesian product of several copies of such a group . for many reasons , both computationally practical and fundamentally theoretical , particularly interesting",
    "are dynamical models invariant under the group underlying geometry of degrees of freedom .",
    "if one deals with a single object and its configuration space is just a lie group , then the only invariant models are geodetic ones , i.e. , with vanishing ( constant ) potentials ; lagrangian is then simply given by the kinetic energy ( its metric is left- or right - invariant under regular translations ) .",
    "the reason is obviously that the only functions on group invariant under regular translations ( it does not matter left or right ) are constant ones .",
    "however , if one deals with the system of such objects , i.e. , if the configuration space is some cartesian - product - power of the underlying group , then of course there exist nontrivial potentials , more generally  nontrivial forces , invariant under this group ( left or right acting ) .",
    "this is a very simple algebraic fact .",
    "if @xmath0 is the mentioned group and we consider , e.g. , a two - body system with the configuration space @xmath1 , then obviously any function @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 is invariant under simultaneous left regular translations of its arguments : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an arbitrary set and @xmath6 is an arbitrary @xmath5-valued function on @xmath0 . in particular , @xmath7",
    ", @xmath8 may be real - valued potential functions .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 given by @xmath9 is invariant under simultaneous right regular translations : @xmath10 for some special choices of @xmath8 one can obtain `` potentials '' invariant simultaneously both under left and right regular translations : @xmath11    an interesting example is provided by characters of finite - dimensional representations of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath12 be such a representation ; @xmath13 is some finite - dimensional linear space and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the neutral element ( identity ) of the group @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a character of @xmath17 : @xmath18 it is obvious that @xmath19 and the function @xmath7 is invariant both under ( [ eq.i.2 ] ) and ( [ eq.i.4 ] ) .",
    "all these concepts become particularly intuitive when we consider systems of rigid bodies , when @xmath20 , the group of rotations in @xmath21 , or its `` quantum - spinorial '' universal covering @xmath22 .",
    "the mutual ( relative ) rotational deflections of such `` rigid bodies '' as molecules in a molecular crystal , or grains in a structured medium , usually modify the potential energy of the system and this potential energy function often exhibits the symmetries as described above .",
    "formally the same problem may be investigated in @xmath23 dimensions , when @xmath24 or its `` quantum - spinorial '' universal covering @xmath25 .",
    "incidentally , let us observe that the same properties are characteristic for the functions of the type : @xmath26    if @xmath0 is non - abelian , then , obviously , the mapping @xmath27 is not any longer the representation of @xmath0 , nevertheless , the property ( [ eq.i.8 ] ) holds .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when @xmath28 ( generally @xmath29 ) , i.e. , when we consider the system of affinely - rigid , i.e. , homogeneously deformable bodies .",
    "as mentioned , systems with such degrees of freedom may be good models of molecular crystals , granular media , and other physical objects .",
    "there are however some delicate problems concerning the possibility and physical status of dynamical affine invariance .",
    "this problem was discussed in many our former papers @xcite .",
    "we discussed there a single affine body , therefore the study of affine invariance was restricted to the structure of kinetic energy . and",
    "even at this stage the problem of affine invariance was a delicate matter .",
    "namely , according to the common belief , all non - relativistic physical theories contain the euclidean spatial metric tensor @xmath30 as a kind of `` controlling parameter '' .",
    "specially - relativistic theories contain the pseudo - euclidean metric of the normal - hyperbolic signature ; formally its status is there exactly like in non - relativistic physics .",
    "the metric tensor is built up into the structure of kinetic energy and other physical quantities . in this way",
    "the assumed kinematical affine symmetry of degrees of freedom is dynamically broken and restricted to euclidean subgroup ( pseudo - euclidean in specially - relativistic theories ) .",
    "but there is at least an academically - motivated interest in following the pattern of mechanics of rigid bodies and their systems .",
    "this motivates the search of models of kinetic energy invariant under the left / right action of the affine group .",
    "such models exist @xcite and are mathematically interesting .",
    "but of course the natural question appears as to their physical utility . in mentioned papers",
    "certain arguments were presented .",
    "the expected application fields usually have to do with situations in condensed matter , microstructure , and in all phenomena where the external influences become secondary in comparison with internal factors . of course",
    ", one could try from the very beginning to think in the following way :",
    "the primary concept is that of kinetic energy or more generally of the kinetic term of lagrangian .",
    "metric - like tensors are byproducts of those kinetic terms , e.g. , as configuration - dependent coefficients of quadratic forms of generalized velocities . of course",
    ", one can reproach against such a reasoning on the basis of general relativity , i.e. , relativistic gravitation theory .",
    "this theory tells us that the metric tensor is a potential of the gravitational field and its special ( pseudo - euclidean , i.e. , flat ) form is simply something like the non - excited `` ground state '' of this field .",
    "so , one could argue , it is a primary physical factor and the structure of kinetic energies is its byproduct .",
    "but nevertheless one can admit possibility of situations where the internal factors are more essential , e.g. , in defect theory .",
    "moreover , one knows from the solid - state physics the situations where really the influence of `` physical '' metric on the inertial properties of bodies is at least remarkably reduced .",
    "for example , the effective inertia of electrons moving in crystals is characterized by the effective mass tensor @xcite which differs from the `` physical '' metric and is some byproduct of complicated interactions in the crystalline medium . on the opposite scale of physical phenomena , in astrophysics",
    ", one can also expect situations where the configuration and internal motion of highly condensed objects like , e.g. , neutron stars is a dominant factor and perhaps in a good approximation to rigorous generally - relativistic considerations ( based on einstein equations ) the surrounding metric field ( which in turn influences the star dynamics ) may be expected to be a simple algebraic byproduct of internal mechanical phenomena .",
    "when systems of mutually interacting affine bodies are studied , some models of potential energy ( usually binary ones ) must be used , either somehow derived from the `` micromodel '' ( usually in a difficult way ) or phenomenologically postulated on the basis of some rough qualitative assumptions and symmetry principles .",
    "this motivates what is done below in the first section .",
    "namely , the concept of relative ( mutual ) deformation tensors of pairs of affine bodies is discussed in details and the scalar invariants built of such tensors are constructed .",
    "they are expected to be basic scalar arguments of binary potentials of mutual interbody interactions .",
    "there is an essential novelty in comparison to deformation scalars of single affine bodies .",
    "namely , there exist affinely - invariant scalars of mutual deformations . because of this one can consider the hierarchy of interaction models according to their invariance groups , from euclidean to affine ones .",
    "there is again an open question of applicability , nevertheless , the models are very interesting at least from the point of view of pure mathematics and rational mechanics .",
    "the analysis performed in the first section might seem too detailed .",
    "without a well - defined geometric and algebraic background , i.e. , when relying merely on analytical matrix calculus , it is almost impossible to avoid misunderstandings and quite real mistakes .",
    "we must begin with some algebraic and geometric formalism .",
    "let @xmath31 , @xmath32 be finite - dimensional linear spaces and @xmath33 , @xmath34  their duals ( linear spaces of linear functions on @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "we deal almost exclusively with real linear spaces , nevertheless , all the concepts quoted below are valid as well when @xmath31 , @xmath32 are linear spaces over the complex field @xmath35 . in the complex case",
    "some additional concepts and structures appear ( e.g. , the complex - conjugate spaces , antidual spaces , etc . ) , however , we will not use them .",
    "the set of linear mappings from @xmath31 into @xmath32 will be denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , @xmath36 carries the canonical linear structure induced pointwisely from the target space @xmath32 .",
    "the symbols @xmath33 , @xmath34 are evident abbreviations for @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the complex case ) .",
    "the manifold of linear monomorphisms ( injections ) from @xmath31 to @xmath32 will be denoted by @xmath41 ; obviously , it is an open submanifold of @xmath36 and is non - empty only if @xmath42 the manifold of linear epimorphisms ( projections ) of @xmath31 onto @xmath32 will be denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "it is also an open submanifold of @xmath36 and is non - empty only when @xmath44 .",
    "the manifold of linear isomorphisms of @xmath31 onto @xmath32 will be denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "obviously , @xmath46 and it is non - empty only if @xmath47 we shall use the obvious abbreviations @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the usual symbols of linear groups @xmath52 , @xmath53 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "it is important for us that @xmath48 , @xmath49 are associative algebras under the usual composition rule as a product and lie algebras under the commutator operation : @xmath56:=ab - ba.\\ ] ] similarly , @xmath52 , @xmath53 are lie groups and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are their lie algebras @xmath57 , @xmath58 in a canonical way ; the exponential mapping being understood literally as a power series in finite - dimensional associative algebras .",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 denote the components of unity in @xmath52 , @xmath53 , i.e. , the connected groups of linear transformations preserving any of two possible orientations in @xmath31 , @xmath32 . to be more in accord with popularly used terms , it is @xmath59 , @xmath60 that are lie groups and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are their lie algebras .",

    "they consist of orientation - reversing mappings and are cosets of @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "obviously , determinants of @xmath63- , @xmath64-mappings are respectively positive and negative . being finite - dimensional linear spaces ( thus abelian lie groups in the additive sense ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are endowed with canonical translationally - invariant lebesgue measures ( special case of the haar measure ) ; they are unique up to a constant multiplier ( normalization ) .",
    "the volume - preserving subgroups , i.e. , unimodular groups @xmath65 , @xmath66 consist of linear mappings the determinants of which have the absolute value equal to 1 .",
    "their special linear subgroups @xmath67 , @xmath68 consist of orientation - preserving mappings , thus ones with determinants equal to one , @xmath69 and so for @xmath32 .",
    "the subgroups @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are `` structure - independent '' in the sense that they do not depend on additional geometric objects in linear spaces .",
    "the same concerns dilatational groups @xmath70 let us also quote the orientation - reversing cosets : @xmath71 ( negative extension factors @xmath72 ) and so for @xmath32 .",
    "all other subgroups , at least practically useful ones , are defined as ones preserving some fixed geometric object or figure in an underlying linear space .    below we will often deal with a pair of linear spaces @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; their ordered bases ( frames ) will be denoted respectively by @xmath73 the corresponding contravariant vector components are denoted as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( summation convention applied ) .",

    "this is the main motivation for this introductory review of symbols .",
    "let us begin with the well - known concept of the conjugate mapping .",
    "namely , with any @xmath85 there is canonically associated the mapping @xmath86 given by @xmath87 in terms of coordinates : @xmath88 roughly speaking , the matrix of @xmath89 is transposed to that of @xmath90 in the usual analytical sense of matrix calculus .",
    "no additional geometric concept is needed for defining the conjugation star - mapping ( [ eq.9 ] ) , ( [ eq.10 ] ) . and",
    "no wonder , the canonical isomorphism of linear spaces @xmath91 described by the star - operation ( [ eq.9 ] ) , ( [ eq.10 ] ) is just the special case of the natural isomorphism between @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 being arbitrary linear spaces ) .",
    "if @xmath31 , @xmath32 have the same dimension and @xmath90 is an isomorphism , i.e. , @xmath96 , then we can define the contragradient mapping @xmath97 given by @xmath98 analytically : @xmath99 where obviously @xmath100 for any @xmath81 , the upper - star - symbol @xmath89 is also used to denote the natural pull - back mapping of the covariant tensor algebra over @xmath32 onto that over @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , one uses @xmath101 to denote the natural extension ( push - forward ) of @xmath90 to the contravariant tensor algebra over @xmath31 ( mapping it into the contravariant tensor algebra over @xmath32 ) .",
    "if @xmath31 , @xmath32 have the same dimension and @xmath90 is an isomorphism , then @xmath101 , @xmath89 may be extended to the isomorphisms of the total tensor algebras , and obviously , @xmath102 in this extended sense as well .",
    "obviously , for any @xmath81 , @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 i.e. , respectively anti - representation and representation properties .    below we shall often use the natural isomorphism of linear spaces @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath106 namely , @xmath107 acts on @xmath81 as a linear functional in the sense of the trace formula : @xmath108 in particular , @xmath109 , @xmath110 are identical with @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we were dealing as yet with amorphous linear spaces @xmath31 , @xmath32 without any additional structure . from now on we assume @xmath31 , @xmath32 to be endowed with some fixed metric tensors , i.e. , symmetric non - degenerate bilinear forms , @xmath111 they are analytically described by their components @xmath112 , @xmath113 with respect to frames @xmath114 , @xmath115 : @xmath116 their reciprocal contravariant tensors denoted by @xmath117 are analytically represented as @xmath118 where , obviously , @xmath119 in mechanical applications @xmath120 , @xmath30 are positively definite , however , at this stage the definiteness problem is not essential .",
    "the pair of euclidean spaces @xmath121 , @xmath122 gives rise to a richer system of invariantly defined geometric objects .",
    "first of all , one can define new transposition concepts .",
    "they are metric - dependent , i.e. , explicitly built of the metric tensors @xmath120 , @xmath30 .",
    "just here they are different and more peculiar than the purely affine ( linear ) concept of the conjugate mapping @xmath89 defined above .",
    "let us begin with coordinate - free definition and later on we quote analytical formulas used in calculations .",
    "the metric tensors @xmath120 , @xmath30 give rise to the `` index - lowering '' operations producing covectors from vectors : @xmath123 they are given by : @xmath124 for any @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath127 for any @xmath128 , @xmath129 .    due to non - singularity of @xmath120 , @xmath30 ( positive definiteness not yet necessary ) , linear operations @xmath130 , @xmath131 are invertible .",
    "their inverses , i.e. , `` index - raising '' operations will be denoted by @xmath132    the @xmath133-transpose of @xmath81 is defined as the linear mapping given by @xmath134 if @xmath133 are obvious from the context , one writes for brevity @xmath135 .",
    "analytically , @xmath135 is given by its matrix @xmath136 $ ] , where @xmath137    if the metrics",
    "@xmath120 , @xmath30 are strictly euclidean , i.e. , positively definite , then there exist orthonormal frames , i.e. , such ones that @xmath138 in such coordinates the matrices of @xmath89 and @xmath135 numerically coincide .",
    "it is no longer the case in general coordinates .",
    "and in the case of non - definite ( pseudo - euclidean ) metrics such coordinates do not exist at all .",
    "let us observe that literally speaking , @xmath89 and @xmath135 belong to different linear spaces , respectively @xmath139 they are mutually dual in a canonical way , however , they are not canonically isomorphic to each other .",
    "the isomorphism may be established only on the basis of metrics @xmath120 , @xmath30 .",
    "the above constructions are valid for arbitrary dimensions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; they need not be equal",
    ". if they are equal and if @xmath90 is an isomorphism , there exists the inverse mapping @xmath140 and the contragradient mapping @xmath141 in certain formulas we shall need the @xmath133-transpose of @xmath142 , @xmath143 it is given by @xmath144 where the labels @xmath120 , @xmath30 at the transposition symbol are omitted for brevity if there is no misunderstanding danger .",
    "the matrix of @xmath145 is given by @xmath146    the above transposes depend explicitly on the both metric tensors @xmath147 and @xmath148 . in certain formulas we use another type of transposes , depending only on one of the metrics .",
    "so , for any @xmath149 we define its @xmath30-transpose @xmath150 again we omit the label @xmath30 when it is clear from the context",
    ". then @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 and has the matrix with elements @xmath153 it depends explicitly on @xmath30 but does not depend on @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath30 is positively definite ( euclidean ) and the frame @xmath114 is orthonormal , then again the matrices of @xmath89 and @xmath151 are identical .",
    "let us observe that obviously @xmath154 and it is only here that the metric of @xmath31 appears .",
    "if dimensions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 are identical and @xmath155 is an isomorphism , then for @xmath140 we define the transpose @xmath156 its matrix is given by @xmath157 obviously , @xmath158 the transpose @xmath159 depends explicitly on @xmath120 , but does not dependent on @xmath30 .",
    "it is seen that the purely analytical meaning of the transposed matrix may be misleading when one does not take care to the geometric status of objects represented by matrices . in various contexts",
    "all the mentioned transposes occur in mechanics of deformable bodies .",
    "everything said above is applicable to the special case of automorphisms , when @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "being mixed tensors , the elements of @xmath48 , @xmath49 can not be transposed in an affinely - invariant manner , in particular they can not be either symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "their transpose is always an essentially metrical concept .",

    "the simplest and most viable models are potential ones , when lagrangians have the following form : @xmath585 where @xmath17 is the kinetic energy quadratic in generalized velocities and @xmath32 depends only on the configuration , i.e. , on generalized coordinates .",

    "the legendre transformation for lagrangians ( [ eq.173 ] ) reads @xmath597    we did not take into account forces depending on velocities , e.g. , magnetic ones . for general models we have obviously the standard rule : @xmath598    even if one admits dissipative forces like the viscous friction , the first step is always to start from lagrangian model with its main kinetic term @xmath17 . roughly speaking ,",
    "this term characterizes inertial properties of the object .",
    "later on one introduces forces of variational structure , i.e. , derivable from some potential @xmath599 or generalized potential @xmath600 depending also on velocities @xmath601 .",
    "generalized potentials may describe , e.g. , magnetic or gyroscopic forces . and the final step , after deriving euler - lagrange equations corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ eq.173 ] ) is to introduce , either phenomenologically or on the basis of statistical - mechanical considerations , some essentially non - lagrangian , dissipative forces @xmath602 ; the corresponding equations of motion have the well - known form : @xmath603    the problem of the main inertial term of nonrelativistic mechanics , @xmath604 was discussed in its various aspects in @xcite in the theory of a single affine body , certain more general aspects were also discussed by capriz @xcite .",
    "it is not only theoretically interesting , but very often just computationally effective to use hamiltonian formalism .",
    "one performs the legendre transformation ( [ eq.179 ] ) , one takes its inverse ( in the `` usual '' mechanics it is assumed to exist ) , i.e. , one expresses generalized velocities @xmath605 as functions of canonical momenta @xmath606 and generalized coordinates @xmath607 , and then one constructs hamiltonian @xmath608 as a function on the phase , i.e. , on the cotangent bundle @xmath513 over the configuration space @xmath438 ; analytically speaking , @xmath608 depends on @xmath588 , @xmath609 , and perhaps explicitly on time @xmath610 ( if @xmath611 does so ) .",

    "if @xmath17 is to split additively into translational and internal parts like in ( [ eq.194 ] ) , then the only natural and at the same time maximally general nonrelativistic models have the following form : @xmath662 where @xmath663 are constants . obviously , they are symmetric in bi - indices : @xmath664    let us observe that such kinetic energies , i.e. , metric tensors on the configuration space @xmath665 are affinely invariant in @xmath342 , but not in the material space @xmath386 .",

    "the general solution contains an open family of bounded orbits , even if no potential is assumed . in any case , it is so , when the motion is isochoric , i.e. , the body is incompressible . for the compressible case , some purely dilatational potential",
    "may be used to stabilized dilatations .",
    "and it is interesting that the main characteristics of motion my be obtained on the basis of exponential functions of matrices . in such bounded solutions ,",
    "the deformation invariants perform finite vibrations . in multibody systems",
    "this concerns both the usual deformation invariants and invariants of mutual deformation tensors defined in section 2 .",
    "the peculiarity of multibody affine systems is that one can also use affinely - invariant potential energies of binary interactions .",
    "this offers a wide class of dynamical models to be postulated as a hypothetical description of interactions in discrete structured media .",
    "their continuous limit will lead to a variety of dynamical models of structured continua .",
    "when dealing with objects like molecules , fullerens , graphens and clusters , one must use the quantized version of the model .",
    "certain primary ideas in this direction were presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper partially contains results obtained within the framework of the research project 501 018 32/1992 financed from the scientific research support fund in 2007 - 2010 .",
    "the authors are greatly indebted to the ministry of science and higher education for this financial support .",
