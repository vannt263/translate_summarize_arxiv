    "the detection of cosmic ray events with energies beyond 10@xmath9ev by agasa ( takeda et al . 1999 ) , fly s eye ( bird et al . 1995 ) , and haverah park ( lawrence , reid , & watson 1991 ) experiments still poses a challenge for the understanding of their nature and sources .",
    "these ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) show no major differences in their air shower characteristics to cosmic rays at lower energies and thus one would expect them to be mostly protons ( protheroe 1999 ) . if uhecrs are charged particles , or protons , then they should be affected by the expected greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) energy cutoff ( @xmath10 ev ) , which is due to photomeson production by interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation , unless they are originated at distances closer than about 50 mpc ( e.g. , protheroe & johnson 1995 , medina tanco , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the uhecrs are mostly protons from nearby sources ( located within @xmath11 50 mpc ) , then the arrival directions of the events should point toward their sources since they are expected to be little deflected by the intergalactic and galactic magnetic fields ( e.g. , stanev 1997 , medina tanco , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 1998 ) .",
    "the present data shows no significant large - scale anisotropy in the distribution related to the galactic disk or the local distribution of galaxies , although some clusters of events seem to point to the supergalactic plane ( takeda et al .",
    "1999 , medina tanco 1998 ) .    a number of source candidates and acceleration mechanisms have been invoked but all of them have their shortcomings ( see , e.g. , olinto 2000 for a review ) .",
    "particles can , in principle , extract the required energies from an induced e.m.f . in a circuit connected between the polar and the last open field line of a rapidly rotating pulsar ,",
    "although it is not clear how the large voltages can be maintained ( e.g. , hillas 1984 ) , or be accelerated in reconnection sites of magnetic loops , @xmath12 these can be produced , e.g. , by parker instability , on the surface of a pulsar ( medina tanco , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 1997 ) , but the accelerated particles will probably lose most of their energy gain by curvature radiation while dragged along by the magnetic dipole field ( sorrell 1987 ) .",
    "alternatively , olinto , epstein , & blasi ( 1999 ) have recently proposed that uhecrs could be iron nuclei stripped by strong electric fields from the surface of highly magnetized neutron stars and accelerated in a relativistic mhd wind .",
    "it is not clear however , how the accelerated particles can escape from the magnetosphere of the star , for although efficient power extraction may be possible , there is a dense positron - electron plasma generated with the relativistic wind ( gallant & arons 1994 ) that will possibly modify the electric fields and also interact with the energetic particles .",
    "their model also predicts that a correlation with the galactic plane should become evident as data collection at the highest energies improves . in this paper",
    "we discuss an alternative model in which uhecrs are accelerated in magnetic reconnection sites outside the magnetosphere of very young millisecond pulsars being produced by accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf .",
    "when a white dwarf reaches the critical chandrasekhar mass @xmath13 m@xmath14 through mass accretion , in some cases it does not explode into a type ia supernova , but instead collapses directly to a neutron star ( e.g. , woosley & baron 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "the accretion flow spins up the star and confines the magnetosphere to a radius @xmath15 where plasma stress in the accretion disk and magnetic stress balance ( arons 1993 ) . at this radius , which also defines the inner radius of the accretion disk",
    ", the equatorial flow will divert into a funnel inflow along the closed field - lines toward the star ( gosh and lamb 1978 ) , and a centrifugally driven wind outflow ( arons 1986 ) .",
    "recently , shu et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1999 ) have studied the detailed field geometry of magnetized stars accreting matter from a disk .",
    "two surfaces of null poloidal field lines are required to mediate the geometry of dipole - like field lines of the star with those opened by the wind and those trapped by the funnel inflow emanating from the @xmath15 region",
    ". labeled as `` @xmath16 @xmath17 '' and `` @xmath18 @xmath19 '' in figure 1 , these magnetic null surfaces begin or end on @xmath20 points . across each null surface ,",
    "the poloidal field suffers a sharp reversal of direction .",
    "dissipation of the large electric currents that develop along the null surfaces will lead to reconnection of the oppositely directed field lines ( e.g. , biskamp 1997 , lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) . helmet streamers ( or flare loops ) are also present in the magnetic field configuration of the solar corona . the magnetic energy released by reconnection in",
    "the helmet streamer drives violent outward motions in the surrounding plasma that accelerate copious amounts of solar cosmic rays without producing many photons ( reames 1995 )",
    ". a similar process may take place in the helmet streamer of young born aic - pulsars and the magnetic energy released may accelerate particles to the uhes .",
    "the reconnection rings in the disk would also , in principle , be able to accelerate uhecrs , however , as we will see below , the intense radiation field produced in the disk must prevent accelerated uhe particles to escape from it .",
    "the particular mechanism of particle acceleration during the reconnection events is still unclear in spite of numerous attempts to solve the problem ( see larosa et al 1996 , litvinenko 1996 ) .",
    "cosmic rays from the sun confirm that the process is sufficiently efficient in spite of the apparent theoretical difficulties for its explanation .",
    "solar flares observations indicate that the reconnection speed can be as high as one tenth of the alfvn velocity . as in the conditions we deal with",
    "this speed approaches @xmath21 , the expected acceleration rate is large .",
    "we discuss the details of particle acceleration during reconnection events in lazarian & de gouveia dal pino ( 2000 ) .",
    "we argue that protons can be accelerated by the large induced electric field within the reconnection region ( e.g. , haswell , tajima , & sakai 1992 , litvinenko 1996 ) over a time scale @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the size of the reconnection zone ( see below ) .",
    "the required electric field is less than the critical value for pair production and therefore is sustainable ( see also  3 ) . for a keplerian disk ,",
    "the inner disk edge @xmath15 rotates at an angular speed ( @xmath24 , and equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force at @xmath15 will lead to co - rotation of the star with the inner disk edge , i.e. , @xmath25 , which for typical millisecond pulsars with rotation periods @xmath26 ms , mass @xmath271 m@xmath28 , and radius @xmath29 cm , gives @xmath30 to @xmath31 cm @xmath32 , where @xmath33 cm .",
    "the primary condition usually assumed on the region to accelerate particles of charge @xmath34 to energies @xmath35 is that its width @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the particle larmour radius @xmath38 ( hillas 1984 ) and @xmath39 is the magnetic field ( normal to particle velocity ) at the @xmath15 region , @xmath40 ( e.g. , arons 1993 ) , where @xmath41 is the magnetic field that would be present in the absence of the shielding disk , and @xmath42 is the magnetic field at the surface of the star .",
    "while this condition on @xmath23 is usually invoked to allow particles to bounce back and forth thus gaining energy , we find that for accelerated protons the synchrotron losses may be too large if they bounce within the reconnection zone .",
    "then , in our model the condition above is invoked to assure that the field @xmath39 will focus particles to move within a small angle into the reconnection zone .",
    "besides , one should also expect that : @xmath43 .",
    "both conditions above imply that @xmath44 .",
    "this relation indicates that for a given ratio @xmath45 and particle energy @xmath35 , the stellar magnetic field @xmath42 must satisfy @xmath46 where we have assumed @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ev , @xmath50 s@xmath6 , and @xmath51 g. the corresponding allowed zones in the @xmath52 plane are shown in figure 2 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and different values of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the curves with @xmath55 determine extreme lower bounds on the stellar surface magnetic field and the angular speed .",
    "we note that stellar magnetic fields @xmath0 g",
    "@xmath56 @xmath2 g and angular speeds @xmath57 s@xmath6",
    "@xmath58 s@xmath6 , are able to accelerate particles to energies @xmath59 1 .",
    "the values above are perfectly compatible with the parameters of young pulsars and eq .",
    "( 1 ) is thus a good representation of the typical conditions required for particle acceleration to the uhes in reconnection zones of aic- pulsars .",
    "the substitution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) into the equation for @xmath39 implies a magnetic field in the acceleration zone @xmath60 g @xmath61 .",
    "a newborn millisecond pulsar spins down due to magnetic dipole radiation in a time scale given by @xmath62 , which for a moment of inertia @xmath63 g @xmath64 gives @xmath65 s @xmath66 .",
    "we can show that the condition that the magnetosphere and the disk stresses are in equilibrium at the inner disk edge results a disk mass accretion rate @xmath67 , where @xmath68 measures the amount of magnetic dipole flux that has been pushed by the disk accretion flow to the inner edge of the disk ( gosh & lamb 1978 , shu et al .",
    "substitution of the previous equations yields @xmath69 s@xmath70 ( where @xmath71 ) , which is much larger than the eddington accretion rate @xmath72 s@xmath73 . however , this `` super - eddington '' accretion ( which is correlated to @xmath74 ) will last for a time @xmath75 , which is only a small fraction ( @xmath76 ) of @xmath74 .",
    "the strong radiation pressure from the accreted material will cause most of the infalling material to be ejected from the system , and this will in turn cause the accretion rate to rapidly decrease to a value nearly equal to the eddington limit ( e.g. , lipunova 1999 ) .",
    "advection dominated inflow - outflow solutions involving supercritical accretion onto neutron stars predict a total mass depostion on the star @xmath11 few @xmath77 ( e.g. , brown et al .",
    "1999 ) . thus assuming that a mass @xmath78 is accreted during the supercritical phase , we find @xmath79 s , and @xmath80 .",
    "the acceleration of uhecrs in the reconnection zone , on the other hand , will last as long as the supercritical accretion .",
    "it is well known that the most violent solar flares can live up to several hours and the more energetic the longer - lived they are . in our scenario , considering that the reconnecting magnetic fields are several orders of magnitude larger than in the solar corona , it is reasonable to expect that the most violent reconnection events can live at least for several days , as required by @xmath81 . the spectrum evolution of the accelerated uhecrs will be , therefore , determined by @xmath82 ( see below ) .    in order to derive the spectrum of accelerated particles ,",
    "let us first evaluate the rate of magnetic energy that can be extracted from the reconnection region , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath851 is a factor that determines the amount of magnetic energy released in the reconnection that will accelerate the particles .",
    "substituting the previous relations into this equation , one finds @xmath86 erg s@xmath87 . according to our model assumptions , in a reconnection",
    "burst an electric field arises inductively because of plasma fow across the @xmath88 lines .",
    "the corresponding maximum voltage drop is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the electric field strength ( e.g. , bruhwiller and zweibel 1992 ) .",
    "once a particle decouples from the injected fluid , it will be ballistically accelerated by the electric field and the momentum attained will depend on the intensity of the electromagnetic burst and on the time and location at which it decouples from the injected fluid motion ( e.g. , haswell et al . 1992 ) .",
    "it is out of the scope of this work to quantitatively constrain the burst characteristics and thus to deduce the detailed spectrum of particle energies .",
    "clearly , however , the more energetic bursts will give rise to a higher average energy for the ejected particles ( haswell et al .",
    "1992 ) . in these extreme cases ,",
    "the induced electric voltage will dominate and the particles will be accelerated to an average energy @xmath91 , which according to the equation above and consistently with relation ( 1 ) is @xmath92 ev .",
    "the uhecr flux emerging from the reconnection site can then be estimated as @xmath93 for particles with energy @xmath94 ev , and the particle spectrum @xmath95 is obtained from @xmath96 , or @xmath97 where eq .",
    "( 1 ) has given @xmath98 ( with the signal made equal in eq .",
    "( 2 ) above predicts that @xmath99 , which is a flat spectrum in good agreement with observations ( e.g. , olinto 2000 ) .",
    "the particle distribution emerging from the source will not be isotropic .",
    "thanks to the magnetic field geometry in the reconnection site ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , it will be confined to a ring ( above and below the accretion disk ) of thickness and height given both by @xmath100 .",
    "the distribution will thus be beamed in a solid angle @xmath101 .",
    "let us now , estimate the resulting flux of uhecrs at the earth .",
    "the total number of objects formed via aics in our galaxy is limited by nucleosynthesis constraints to a very small rate @xmath102 ) yr@xmath6 , or in other words , less than 0.1 % of the total galactic neutron star population ( fryer et al .",
    "assuming then that the rate of aics in the galaxy is @xmath103 yr@xmath6 , we can evaluate the probability @xmath104 @xmath105 of having uhecrs events produced in the galaxy .",
    "the beaming mentioned above will reduce the probability of detection of the events of a source by a factor @xmath106 .",
    "thus the probability will be only @xmath107 , where @xmath108 years accounts for the time the uhecr events have been collected in earth detectors since the operation of the first experiments .",
    "since the individual contribution to the observed uhecrs due to aics in our galaxy is so small we must evaluate the integrated contribution due to aics from all the galaxies located within a volume which is not affected by the gzk effect , i.e. , within a radius @xmath109 mpc .",
    "assuming that each galaxy has essentially the same rate of aics as our galaxy and taking the standard galaxy distribution @xmath110 mpc@xmath111 ( peebles 1993 ) ( with the hubble parameter defined as @xmath112 100 km s@xmath113 mpc@xmath6 ) , the resulting flux at @xmath114 1 is @xmath115 , which gives @xmath116 where @xmath117 yr@xmath118 , and @xmath119 h@xmath120 mpc@xmath111 .",
    "observed data by the agasa experiment ( takeda et al .",
    "1999 ) gives a flux at @xmath12110@xmath9 ev of @xmath122 gev@xmath6 @xmath123 s@xmath118 , so that the efficiency of converting magnetic energy into uhecr should be @xmath8 in order to reproduce such a signal .",
    "we have discussed the possibility that the uhecr events observed above the gzk limit are protons accelerated in reconnection sites just above the magnetosphere of very young millisecond pulsars originated by accretion induced collapse .",
    "aic - pulsars with surface magnetic fields @xmath0 g @xmath1 @xmath2 g and spin periods 1 ms @xmath3 60 ms , are able to accelerate particles to energies @xmath4 ev .",
    "these limits can be summarized by the condition @xmath124 g @xmath125 ms)@xmath126 ( eq . 1 and fig .",
    "because the expected rate of aic sources in our galaxy is very small , the total flux is given by the integrated contribution from aic sources produced in the distribution of galaxies within a volume which is unaffected by the gzk cutoff ( of radius @xmath127 mpc ) .",
    "we find that the reconnection efficiency factor needs to be @xmath8 in order to reproduce the observed flux .",
    "this result is appealing because it predicts no correlation of uhecr events with the galactic plane , in agreement with present observations .",
    "however , as data collection improves , we should expect some sign of correlation with the local distribution of galaxies and the supergalactic plane .",
    "these predictions can be ultimately tested by coming experiments such as the auger observatory which will provide high statistics samples of uhecrs .",
    "the model predicts a highly super - eddington accretion mass rate during part of the aic process .",
    "in such a regime , one should expect a large mass outflow from the stellar surface itself which might alter the coronal conditions near the helmet streamer region .",
    "however , the strong closed magnetic fields in the pulsar magnetosphere can inhibit the gas outflow from the stellar surface if the surface temperature does not exceed the value at which the radiation energy density ( @xmath128 ) equals the magnetic field energy density ( @xmath129 ) , i.e. , @xmath130 k @xmath131 ; this upper limit is consistent with the predicted values for a neutron star that is formed by aic ( woosley & baron 1992 ) .",
    "let us consider now the energy loss mechanisms that may affect the efficiency of the acceleration of the particles to the uhes .",
    "energy losses by curvature radiation which occur when cosmic rays have to stream along magnetic field lines with a finite radius of curvature @xmath132 , have a cooling time @xmath133 . in our model",

    "1 ) where @xmath134 and therefore , @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the acceleration time for a proton in the reconnection site . [ we can use the dimensions of the reconnection site derived in  2 to estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath137 . ]",
    "the time for synchrotron losses is @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the particle pitch angle .",
    "since we require that the protons in the reconnection zone are accelerated by an induced electric field rather than by a scattering process , they are expected to maintain beamlike pitch angles while escaping along the magnetic field lines , i.e. , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the accelerated protons may also undergo energy loss by pion and @xmath142 pair production due to interactions with photons from the accretion disk radiation field .",
    "the characteristic distance scales for these processes can be estimated by @xmath143 and @xmath144 for photo - pion and pair production , respectively , where @xmath145 is the photon number density at the reconnection site , @xmath146 @xmath123 is the cross section for pion production , and @xmath147 @xmath123 is the cross section for pair production ( e.g. , bednarek and protheroe 1999 ) . in order to estimate @xmath145",
