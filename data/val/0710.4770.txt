    "in recent years a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of useful electronic devices utilizing the aharonov - bohm  @xcite ( ab ) phase in multiply - connected geometries.@xcite in particular , there has been interest in spin - sensitive devices  @xcite that are the single - electron analogue of semiconductor spintronics.@xcite most of the research conducted in this direction has focused on _ mesoscopic _ systems , where the ab flux quantum matches weak magnetic fields , inter - electronic dependencies can be relatively negligible , and the rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite spin - orbit coupling or inhomogeneous magnetic fields,@xcite provide a large and controllable dependency of the electron hamiltonian on directionally significant spin eigenvalues.@xcite    at the _ nanometric _ scale , it has been shown that _",
    "spin - independent _ ab molecular interferometers may be possible at reasonable magnetic fields when the coupling of the device to the leads is small.@xcite for such small ab interferometers there are striking differences in the properties of magnetic versus electric gauges , and the magnetic gate becomes advantageous over electrical gating.@xcite for example , the current in a multi - terminal molecular device can be tuned by changing the polarity of the magnetic field utilizing its symmetry breaking nature.@xcite another example includes fundamental differences between magnetic and electric gates with respect to inelastic effects.@xcite    previous studies of nanometeric molecular ab interferometers have ignored the spin degree of freedom . in such molecular - scale systems , if the likes of atomic spin - orbit coupling and magnetic ions are not prevalent,@xcite the lack of a rashba / dresselhaus field and the difficulties in locally manipulating the external magnetic field at such scales leaves only the much smaller zeeman term to differentiate between spins.@xcite in addition , the small size of such devices further complicates matters by introducing large charging effects.@xcite these should become especially noticeable when the coupling between the device and the leads is weak ( as required for nanometeric devices operating at reasonable magnetic fields ) , since electrons spend a longer time on the device . despite these inconveniences , one may very well wonder whether it is possible to develop molecular ab interferometers as single - electron spin - devices such as a spin filter or splitter .",
    "this is the question that interests us here .    in this paper",
    "we develop the basic physical foundation to develop such devices . in section",
    "[ sec : devices ] we describe the types of devices we wish to model and define their efficiency in terms of the spin - dependent current .",
    "this includes a two - terminal spin filter and a three - terminal spin splitter . in section  [ sec : independent - electron - calculations ]",
    "zeeman splitting is introduced into the two models developed by hod _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for independent spinless electrons - a simple continuum one - dimensional model and a more detailed tight - binding model . within the simple continuum model we provide an exact solution for the spin - dependent conductivity for the two- and three - terminal devices .",
    "the role of the different model parameters is studied and comparison between the simple continuum model and the tight - binding results are made . in section  [ sec : coulomb - blockade - calculation ] the tight - binding levels are used in a master equation calculation  @xcite to examine charging effects in the coulomb blockade regime . from this basic analysis",
    "some interesting conclusions are drawn regarding the properties and limitations of nanospintronic ab devices , and a few potential avenues for further research are pointed out in section  [ sec : conclusions - directions - for - further ] .",
    "we will examine two types of elementary nanometric devices with and without charging effects : a spin filter and a spin splitter , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] . such devices might be built from molecular rings such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon,@xcite or from atomic corrals ( with the advantage of controlled structure and electron density).@xcite such corrals can be constructed atom by atom using scanning tunneling microscopy techniques.@xcite a more exotic example involves 3d nanostructures such as torus knots , where a periodicity of more than @xmath0 can be achieved , producing a stronger ab effect than simple rings . in such molecular structures ,",
    "control over the structure s geometry is possible at the atomic level ( unlike the case of mesoscopic rings ) .",
    "the filter does not really require something as complex as an ab ring for its realization .",
    "one only requires two single - spin levels which can , by manipulation of the magnetic field , be moved in and out of the conduction energy window , and any atom , quantum dot , or other discrete system can meet this requirement .",
    "this case is treated because it provides a simple example with only two terminals and yet may still be useful . the splitter is a molecular stern - gerlach device and is somewhat more interesting : having three terminals , it actually requires a device which , like an ab ring , has some sort of inherent asymmetry in either its construction or in the spinor wavefunction .",
    "it is useful at this point to examine the energy scales of the problem .",
    "the fermi energy is the most important parameter . for a half - filled conduction band",
    "the fermi wavelength is of the order of four bond lengths @xmath1 .",
    "this gives a fermi energy of @xmath2 if we set the lowest level to zero , regardless of ring size and assuming atomic spacing of about @xmath3 . to a good approximation , the molecular orbital energy ( at zero magnetic field @xmath4 )",
    "is given by an effective mass model @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the radius of the ring and @xmath8 is the effective mass .",
    "this gives a value for the fermi quantum number of @xmath9 .",
    "electronic levels on the rings near the fermi energy are separated by @xmath10 , which reduces linearly with @xmath7 . for rings of the order of several nanometers in diameter the separation between levels near the fermi energy is of the order of sub electron volts .",
    "this is also the order of magnitude of the charging energies @xmath11 .",
    "other energy scales involve the magnetic field splitting which can be as large as the level spacing and the zeeman splitting @xmath12 per tesla , which is only about a third of the thermal energy at @xmath13 .",
    "the effectiveness of these devices can be judged not only by output polarization , but also by unitarity : a perfect device always sends the correct electrons into the correct lead .",
    "more precisely , the two devices that will be discussed are judged by the following quantities :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the up / down current for the two terminal device and @xmath16 is the up / down current for channel @xmath17 or @xmath18 for the three terminal device .",
    "the only important properties these quantities need to have for the purpose of this work is that they should be bounded from above by @xmath17 , and should reach @xmath17 only in the case of perfect operation .",
    "for the two and three terminal devices both requirements are satisfied .",
    "we refer to them from now on as `` efficiencies ''",
    ".    the problem of building a perfect device can thus be mathematically restated as the problem of optimizing its efficiency to the desired value , usually unity , over the space of all controllable parameters .",
    "these include the magnetic field , the ring s radius and structure , the gate and bias voltage ( or the chemical potential ) and the lead placement and coupling .",
    "reasonable ranges for these parameters must be assumed : magnetic fields of more than a few tesla may pose a technical limitation , as are large rings where disorder effects begin to dominate.@xcite the leads can not be too close to one another to avoid direct tunneling and should be coupled strongly enough to make the environmental coupling unimportant . even within these limits ,",
    "the problem remains numerically formidable in all models .",
    "we will therefore also discuss a conceptually simpler if less systematic way of designing perfect devices .",
    "in this section we describe the physical principles required to construct molecular spin filter and spin splitter devices in the limit where charging effects can be ignored and the complexity of the many - body physics can be reduced to a simplified one - electron picture .      to discuss the basic physical principles involved , let us first regard a simple analytical model for the transmission through an ab ring.@xcite the physics of this model for molecular conductors was recently discussed by hod _",

    "it consists of a conducting ring of radius @xmath7 coupled to two or three conducting wires placed in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field , @xmath19 .",

    "the lack of a rashba field in molecular conductors allows us to safely ignore spin - orbit coupling effects . in the common case where the scalar potential @xmath30 governing the system is periodic or nearly so ,",
    "the effective mass approximation can be used and the pauli hamiltonian can be reduced to : @xmath31 where @xmath8 is the effective mass of the electrons . since the two additive terms in the hamiltonian must commute ( one depending only on the orbital part and the other on the spin part of the wavefunction ) ,",
    "we can adopt the solution of hod _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the transmission of electrons through the two prototype devices ( spin filter and splitter ) .",
    "we adopt a transformation @xmath32 which allows us to project spin effects onto a calculation where spin was previously neglected , noting that the spin dependent part of the hamiltonian under a constant field must have the two eigenvalues @xmath33 for spin up / down electrons .",
    "this transformation is not limited to the specific hamiltonian described above : the only requirement is that @xmath34 does not contain a spin dependency .",
    "furthermore , even for inhomogeneous magnetic fields , where the spin - dependent term in the hamiltonian does not commute with @xmath34 , a similar transformation in the limit of adiabatic spin dynamics can be made , where in addition to a shift in energy one has to introduce a shift in the magnetic flux.@xcite    using the standard analytical approach of treating a 1d ring based on a scattering matrix formalism,@xcite the transmission as a function of energy , previously calculated for spinless electrons,@xcite need only be modified by the zeeman energies for up ( down ) electrons , which affects only the kinetic phase angles @xmath35 in the expression : @xmath36 the transmission itself is the solution of the linear scattering problems with the final results for the two - terminal device shown in the upper panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : analytic spin - transmission ] .",
    "the effects of changing the kinetic phase angle are more involved than the case studied before.@xcite in the case of spinless electrons , the kinetic phase angle depends only on the product @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , changing the energy of the conduction electron by the application of a gate voltage , changing the ring dimensions , and changing the effective mass of the conduction electron can be mapped onto a universal curve.@xcite in the present study there are three independent parameters that affect the kinetic phase angle in different ways .",
    "for example , the position of the conduction peaks can be shifted by adjusting the energy of the conduction electron by the application of a gate voltage .",
    "this is depicted in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic spin - transmission ] .",
    "however , the change in the energy of the conduction electron also affects the splitting between the conduction peaks of the up / down spins as previously discussed .",
    "altering the effective mass within the ring with the chemical potential held constant , for instance by a change of composition or inter - atomic distance in the ring atoms , modifies the kinetic phase and can thus increase or decrease the splitting as shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic spin - transmission ] .",
    "finally , as the ring radius is increased , the splitting for a set flux ratio decreases since this ratio then represents a smaller field as depicted in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic spin - transmission ] .",
    "however , for the same reason , greater magnetic flux ratios become accessible for larger rings .",
    "it is often more instructive to look at the results shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic spin - transmission ] , where the familiar diamond - shaped conduction pattern within the energy / phase ratio plane behaves more simply and predictably , in order to gain a better intuitive understanding of the system . here , the two ends of the white conduction lines represent up / down conduction where the chemical potential and magnetic field are at the middle of such lines .",
    "varying @xmath66 still affects only the peak widths , modifying @xmath7 changes the lengths of the conduction lines , changing @xmath8 scales the diagram in the energy axis without changing the length of the conduction lines and altering the energy of the conduction electron scales the diagram along with the lines in the same axis .",
    "thus , in order to construct an efficient spin filter one has to construct this diagram and control the position of the white conduction lines by the application of a proper magnetic field and gate voltages to achieve a desired behavior .",
    "good molecular spin filters can be made when two conduction peaks with different spins are sufficiently separated in energy and magnetic field to allow only electrons of one spin to traverse the ring .",
    "this is best achieved for molecular devices with a large effective mass for the conduction electron and small couplings between the leads and the ring ( `` bad contact '' ) . in fig .",

    "if levels with the transmissive properties of the ones previously discussed are selected , the zeeman energy need not span the space between them .",
    "this can be done by the bias voltage and the zeeman term must be no more than the level broadening ( or a few @xmath109 if this is more ) to ensure conduction of only one spin per level .",
    "however , the conduction of electrons in the entire window of bias voltage should vanish in order to make efficient spin - splitter devices , since the biased current is the integral of the transmission over this energy range .    in an extension of the graphical method shown , the biased conduction window",
    "could be represented by a line of length @xmath110 ( purple line ) , where @xmath111 is the bias voltage .",
    "all `` spinless '' levels on this line conduct . centered on the line s ends",

    "now , if this line is placed like the white lines in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : high - r - config ] , with the levels at the ends in the one spin zones , the desired result is achieved as long as the conduction is zero for all other energies covered by the bias voltage .",
    "this can , however , be done at much higher energies and lower fields than those shown in the upper panels , since the level spacing spanned by the bias voltage can easily be orders of magnitude greater than @xmath113 .    in order to make a stronger argument that the spin - splitting configurations are a physical phenomenon rather than an idiosyncrasy of the simple one - dimensional analytical model used here , one might proceed by reproducing them in a more detailed numerical model . while remaining in the independent electron picture ,",
    "an obvious and flexible choice is a ring of atoms represented by a tight - binding hamiltonian , for which conductance can be calculated with the methods described above .",
    "the wealth of parameters makes it problematic to fine - tune exactly corresponding arrangements between the two models , and yet it is quite a simple matter to construct in one model a ring and lead configuration which worked well as a splitter in the other , and to try and see how well it works at some choice of parameters which should have analogous physical meaning .",
    "this should be more similar to what might be done in an actual experiment .    since in the analytical model of a @xmath114 ring we have already located , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : high - r - config ] , a good splitter configuration near @xmath115 , the same configuration ( with some effective mass ) would be a convincing place to look for a splitter using the tight - binding model .",

    "[ fig : effectiveness ] we plot the current as a function of the experimentally available parameters - the gate voltage and the magnetic field strength .",
    "the familiar asymmetric structure from the previous plots is blurred , but still readily recognizable in the two left panels , while the right panel shows the high effectiveness which can be reached when the magnetic field , the gate voltage and the bias voltage are all appropriately tuned .",
    "the location of the effectiveness peak could be easily predicted by the transmission line method previously discussed .",
    "obviously , it would be practically impossible to stumble upon such a fortunate combination of conditions by accident , and any experiment must search for them under the explicit guidance of a model such as the analytical model suggested above .",
    "so far , we have ignored the energy it takes to inject multiple charges into the small region of the ring .",
    "this is of some concern since , as will be discussed below , the charging energy can be very significant here and especially when ring - leads coupling is weak , charging effects can play a major role . to stress this point , consider a device ( ring ) that is charged with an electron of spin up",
    ". the energy it takes to bring another electron with a spin down can be significantly different than in the single electron picture .",
    "can this additional degree of freedom provide means to construct more efficient molecular spin filter and spin splitter devices , or will it prevent their realization ?     and height @xmath116 with a cylindrical hole of radius @xmath86 , where @xmath117 is taken as @xmath118 to provide a square profile .",

    "the addition of the charging term will shift non - neutral bands up linearly in the charging energy with an increasing slope for charged configurations .",
    "one should be able to compensate for these changes by using a gate or bias voltage , as discussed below .",
    "one of the simplest ways of taking the charging energy into consideration in the regime of strong charging energy and weak lead binding is within a multi - electron master equation approach.@xcite the correctness of the method requires that the effects of broadening be negligible , which is quite generally not true , but the approximation nevertheless provides some insight into the behavior of nanometric devices when charging has been accounted for , particularly when a nonzero bias has been applied .",
    "this formalism is statistical only , and unfortunately this makes discussion of _ perfect _ devices that send every electron to the right place more difficult than it is in the single - electron formalism .",
    "alternatively , one can utilize a perturbation treatment in the lead - device coupling , recently suggested by knig and gefen for an ab mesoscopic ring,@xcite however , this approach is limited to off - resonant transport only .    before we proceed to discuss the calculation of the current within the multi - electron master equation approach , we briefly digress to the matter of estimating the charging energy and its variation with ring geometry . calculating the energy needed to ( uniformly )",

    "the charging energy increases considerably and can exceed several electron volts for sub - nanometer rings .",

    "several differences are nevertheless evident . in the single electron formalism",
    "a device will conduct at zero bias when the chemical potential coincides with an energy level on the device . in the master equation formalism",
    "this still happens when the charging energy is zero . under such conditions",
    ", the difference in energy between the neutral state and the first charged state always equals the fermi energy , and this difference is obviously contained in the zero - bias conduction window .    in the presence of charging ,",
    "the picture is somewhat more involved .",
    "the same states discussed above are now shifted differently by charging since they have a different number of electrons . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we will first consider the simplest case where only @xmath18 levels and thus @xmath170 states are included .",
    "we assume that the system can have @xmath171 electrons , @xmath129 electrons , or @xmath172 electrons with energies @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , respectively ( @xmath176 is the single electron level energy ) .",

    "when the chemical potential in one of the leads equals the energy difference between multi - electron states a peak will appear in the differential conductance .",

    "the conduction peaks are expected to appear at @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( these peaks are doubly degenerate ) .",

    "the difference in current between the two polarization can be seen in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , where we zoom in on a specific area of the line described by @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the gate voltage . here , one spin starts to flow at slightly lower bias voltages , the current rising with the voltage to a high peak and then falling back down as the other spin begins to flow as well .",
    "a plane cut through this surface is shown in panel ( e ) , where it is clearly demonstrated how by tuning the voltages a spin filter can still be constructed when charging is taken into account .",
    "a symmetric filter for the opposite spin type is found when inverting the gate voltage . as can be seen in the figure ,",
    "the first conduction peak occurs at @xmath187 and the second occurs at @xmath188 . as a result of the broken symmetry , these peaks are non - degenerate and correspond to transition with @xmath189 .",

    "this is in contrast to the simple example where only @xmath170 states were considered , as describe above , where the current peaks are degenerate and appear simultaneously .",
    "one of the interesting features shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - filter ] is the negative differential _",
    "spin _ conductance of the spin up electron ( panel ( g ) ) .",
    "this is explained by the sudden drop in the population of the @xmath191 state ( corresponding to a conduction electron of spin up ) as the change in chemical potentials begins to allow the population of state @xmath192 ( corresponding to a conduction electron of spin down ) .",
    "this population switching is reminiscent of the nonmonotonic change of occupation in two electrostatically coupled single - level quantum dots.@xcite the state populations are shown in panel ( h ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : me - filter ] .",
    "the drop in the spin up state population is correlated with the occurrence of negative differential _",
    "conductance ( the conduction is normalized to the maximal value  @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained in the following way : the current for each spin is determined by the product of the probability that the system is in state @xmath48 and the rate of transitions between state @xmath48 and state @xmath193 ( which is the state with no conducting electrons ) , where @xmath48 is @xmath192 for spin up conducting electron and @xmath191 for spin down conducting electron .",
    "we therefore expect that at chemical potentials where the relevant fermi functions and hence the rates are nearly constant , the current will be approximately proportional to the population .      the discussion of the spin splitter within the multi - electron master equation is more involved than the spin filter and requires at least @xmath170 levels ( @xmath194 states ) .",
    "we assume that at @xmath129 ( the neutral occupation ) two of the four conduction levels are occupied .",
    "having previously established a way in which single electron levels suitable for spin splitting can be found on a ring , we focus on the effects of charging .",
    "first , and for the moment neglecting charging energies , we assume that we have found two levels with energies @xmath195 that are spin degenerate without zeeman splitting , with the following properties : they should be adjacent ( other than perhaps for non - transmissive levels , which will not qualitatively affect our results ) , and should both be coupled symmetrically to the input lead , while each is coupled to a single different output lead",
    ". other levels should be at least @xmath196 away in energy .",
    "all couplings are taken to be the same and diagonal couplings are ignored .",
    "accounting for zeeman splitting will simply shift each of these levels in energy by @xmath197 without modifying the coupling . as before for the single electron picture , the coupling between levels with different spins is neglected .",
    "an example of such a case is discussed above in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin - splitter ] where @xmath198 is given in terms of the ring level spacing ( c.f . , eq .  [ eq : ratiorule0 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : high - r - config ] ) .     apart where @xmath199 , each of which is further split by the zeeman energy at @xmath200 .",
    "the upper diagrams show the conductance through the two output channels when the charging energy is ignored and the lower diagrams shows the conductance of the two output channels at a charging energy of @xmath201 . we have adjusted the gate potential so that in both cases the current rises at @xmath202 and at this value only one spin conducts through each lead.,width=302 ]    setting the chemical potential of the input lead to @xmath203 and both output chemical potentials to @xmath204 , it should now be clear under both formalisms that without charging energy a perfect spin splitter exists at @xmath205 , as shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : me - splitter ] . in the single electron picture",
    "this happens as two levels with opposite spins and different lead bindings enter the conduction window . in the multi - electron master equation",
    "this happens when the difference in energy between @xmath206 states and @xmath207 states enters the conduction window .",
    "these two conditions are equivalent for @xmath208 .    including charging effects will cause the @xmath209 states to move up in energy by @xmath173 .",
    "this has the effect of repositioning the conductance peaks at @xmath210 .",
    "if @xmath173 is of the order of the zeeman term then the charging energy will interfere with the structure that allowed our spin splitter for @xmath208 , since the energy difference between states that differ by one electron of both spin up and spin down can become similar . on the other hand ,",
    "if the charging energy is increased further , the transitions @xmath211 and @xmath212 become distinguishable in energy .",
    "one way to take advantage of this is to apply a gate potential in order to shift the state energies by @xmath213 so that only the @xmath214 transitions are in the conduction window ( new transitions may appear at similar energies if other levels are too close , but since level spacing for a ring generally increases with energy we can neglect such contributions ) . once again at @xmath215 perfect splitting occurs , though at a smaller total current , since fewer state transitions are involved .",
    "this is apparent in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : me - splitter ] .",
    "we have investigated several ways in which rings or ring - like structures with a radius of the order of nanometers , coupled to metallic leads , might be used to construct simple spin - sensitive devices .",
    "we have focused only on the zeeman splitting to differentiate between spins , since it is always present while other effects commonly utilized in microscopic structures , such as the rashba and dresselhaus effects , are generally absent in molecular / nanometric structures .",
    "we believe the niche this work occupies in the search for nanospintronic devices is yet unexplored : very small coherent structures and weak spin - dependent effects have not received much attention , despite their formal simplicity and significance .",
    "what we have shown here is that although building devices under the burden of such limitations is difficult , it is possible .",
    "considering the scientific and technological benefits of such devices we believe it will also be worthwhile .",
    "the basic calculations we have performed are enough to point one in the right direction as to the desired properties of molecule - sized aharonov - bohm spin devices and the conditions which their desired operation might be observed .",
    "a similar methodology can be applied to more complex devices or sets of devices .",
    "the actual devices specifically discussed here were two of the most basic - a spin - filter and a spin - splitter or stern - gerlach device .",
    "however , the conclusions drawn and principles laid out may easily be extended to many interesting systems , from quantum gates ( since in theory we can use interference devices to perform general unitary transformations between input and output gates ) to molecular memory ( since an electron trapped on the device will modify its electrical properties and thus may be detectable at a later time ) .",
    "several complementary methods were utilized during the course of this investigation : first , a simple single - electron , analytical model in which the parameter space can easily be explored , and thus basic intuition about the system can be gained .",
    "second , a tight - binding nonequilibrium green s function treatment , which incorporates a more realistic physical structure that can be compared directly with experimental data , but still assume independent electrons , was applied to similar systems studied within the simple analytical model .",
    "finally , a multi - electron master equation approach that can be used to examine many - particle effects was grafted onto the tight - binding results . here , we choose to focus on electric charging , since its effects are energetically dominant .",
    "our analysis of the filter , meant to be a test - case , was based on the study of the spinless case where it was possible to create very narrow conduction peaks near zero magnetic field by combining weak device / leads couplings and a gate voltage to shift the conduction resonances to @xmath4.@xcite since the zeeman splitting depends linearly on the magnetic field , a spin filter always requires a finite magnetic field , at least high enough to separate the spin conduction peaks in energy by more than @xmath109 .",
    "control over the position of the spin - dependent conduction peaks and their widths can be achieved by carefully adjusting the kinetic phase @xmath216 and the coupling between the device and the leads , respectively . unlike the spinless case where @xmath217",
    ", the kinetic phase is now a function of the magnetic flux itself , and thus , the conduction is not a simple periodic function of the parameters .",
    "high efficiency spin filters are constructed at the highest magnetic field possible , where spin - dependent effects are strongest , and flexibility is gained by selecting materials or structures with high effective mass ( or large ring size , which is not desirable ) .",
    "charging effects do not drastically modify this picture since spin selectivity depends only the zeeman term and the application of a gate voltage can compensate for the charging energy itself .",
    "however , charging leads to a breaking of symmetries and as a result to negative differential spin - conduction .",
    "the physics of the spin splitter device is similar to that described above with the added complication that differentiated control of the spin - dependent wavefunction at the different leads is required . within the single electron picture , a spin splitter device may operate when two spin - degenerate levels exist such that one transmits through one lead only and the other through the other lead only .",
    "furthermore , the level separation should equal exactly the zeeman splitting .",
    "alternatively , the level separation can be compensated for by the application of a bias voltage , as long as there are no transmissive levels between the two spin - degenerate levels .",
    "here , parameter space includes the ring size , effective mass , device - leads couplings , and the angles between the output leads .",
    "increasing the effective mass , as before , reduces the level spacing on the ring , thereby enabling the construction of spin splitters at lower magnetic fields and with smaller dimensions . charging breaks the symmetry and can reduce the overall current through the device . however , charging does not abolish the general picture and the application of a gate potential can be used to overcome most of its effects .    for both prototype devices",
    "we have shown how the limits of lead - coupling , system geometry and temperature at which one might expect to see the desired effects can easily be estimated , as well as several ways in which one can implement specific behaviors by systematically finding parameters at which they occur , either exactly or approximately .",
    "we have also shown that even within the parameters space of a device formed by a single ring with two or three leads , nontrivial behaviors with useful properties take place . in at least two instances ,",
    "we have made a case that our findings are physical rather than a mathematical peculiarity of some model by reproducing them under different assumptions and formalisms .",
    "we have found an interesting example of negative differential conductance for a spin polarized current with a simple explanation .",
    "finally , we have described what is , to our knowledge , the smallest stern - gerlach apparatus ever reasonably conceived of , and one which is fully switchable in directionality at constant magnetic field by the application of an external electric field .    despite their simplicity ,",
    "the calculations reported here provide several novel predictions that seem to be model independent .",
    "nevertheless , more refined models are an important set of directions to continue along . in particular",
    ", drawing from the study of crystals and mesoscopic systems , we see ways of enhancing the effect of zeeman splitting which require a more elaborate electronic structure description .",
    "one such is through the effects of spin - orbit coupling and the local spin density exchange - correlation energy , both of which have been used to explain the giant spin @xmath27-factor enhancement that has been observed in mesoscopic structures under certain conditions.@xcite it is quite possible that the same effect can be recreated with discrete levels , although this probably requires that only a small number of levels be occupied ( corresponding once again to very low electron densities ) .",
    "while we have studied only two- and three - terminal devices , with only one injective terminal , it is reasonable that four terminal devices will also be of interest as coherent quantum gates .",
    "one of the reasons we have found it worthwhile to draw attention to the importance of many - particle effects is our hope that in time - dependent calculations they may be used to create sequential logical behavior without sacrificing coherence - for instance , an electron may only be able to enter the device through one lead , but when it enters it opens up another lead , and the inflow of another electron causes both to be discharged through a third lead - a sort of sequential and gate , two of which could form a true and gate . of course , to consider useful computation it is necessary to model entire networks of such gates , where input electrons enter on one set of leads , propagate throughout the network and leave it on another set of leads .",
    "such a network presents new delocalized challenges unless devices are somehow coupled in such a way that no inter - device interference takes place .",
    "however , even if the devices within the network are all `` imperfect '' devices that only approximate logic gates , as long as every device has independently adjustable parameters ( like a gate voltage ) such a network forms a fascinating basis for a model of a quantum neural networks . these and related issues are still open for future study .",
