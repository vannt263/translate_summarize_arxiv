    "in conventional metals , according to migdal s theorem,@xcite the smallness of the parameter @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron - phonon coupling , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are typical phonon and electron energies respectively , permits to describe succesfully the electron - phonon coupled system by neglecting the vertex corrections in the electronic self - energy .",
    "the application of migdal s theorem to the superconducting state has led to the migdal - eliashberg ( me ) theory of superconductivity , which accurately describes the conventional superconductors . however , in recent years , the discovery of complex materials showing high-@xmath1 superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance etc .",
    "has raised doubts concerning the validity of migdal s theorem for such class of materials .",
    "in fact , the fullerene compounds show vibrational spectra ranging from few mev to about 0.2 ev , while the electronic conduction band has a width of approximately 0.5 ev.@xcite in this situation therefore the adiabatic parameter can be as large as @xmath6 .",
    "also for the cuprates the situation points toward the breakdown of migdal s theorem .",
    "for example , bscco compounds have @xmath7 which is a small but not negligible value.@xcite for these systems therefore the electronic and phononic dynamics have comparable energy scales and there is not an _ a priori _ justification to neglect the vertex corrections .",
    "@xcite    recently , we have proposed a generalization of the me theory to include the first nonadiabatic effects.@xcite our aim was to provide a scenario for the high-@xmath1 superconductivity different from the ones arising from purely electronic or magnetic pairing mechanisms .",
    "we were motivated by several clues such as the absence of magnetic ordering in doped fullerenes and the presence of large isotope effects in underdoped cuprates.@xcite moreover , the recent observation of an ion - mass dependence of the penetration length in underdoped yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 and la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 @xcite has provided a strong evidence for the breakdown of migdal s theorem.@xcite    a theoretical framework which goes beyond migdal s limit can lead to different situations . for example , by enhancing the coupling to the lattice vibrations one could end to polaron and eventually to bi - polaron formation with the appearance of huge effective masses for the charge carriers . such a regime is beyond migdal s limit , however it unlikely gives rise to high temperature superconductivity and the observation of a fermi surface contraddicts the hypothesis of condensation of preformed bi - polarons in its simplest form .",
    "instead our approach is a perturbative one , where the small parameter is @xmath2 . in this way",
    "the electron - phonon coupled system is away from the polaron formation which is definitely a non - perturbative approach.@xcite one advantage of our method is to have an appreciable enhancement of the effective coupling in the cooper channel and at the same time reasonable values of charge carrier masses .",
    "moreover , the detailed study of the first nonadiabatic corrections to the me theory has unlighted the importance of the interplay between the exchanged frequency @xmath14 and the momentum transfer @xmath0 in the electron - phonon scattering process .",
    "the first vertex correction is in fact very sensitive to the ratio @xmath15 in such a way that as long as @xmath16 the vertex assumes positive values which reflects to an enhancement of the critical temperature @xmath1.@xcite this strong @xmath17-dependence of the nonadiabatic corrections leads also to interesting effects in the pressure coefficient of the superconducting transition temperature@xcite and in the tunneling current in the superconducting state.@xcite    another striking feature is certainly the different effective el - ph couplings associated to the normal state and the cooper channel .",
    "in fact the nonadiabatic theory of superconductivity introduces two effective couplings , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which in the adiabatic limit reduce both to @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electron - phonon coupling of the me theory .",
    "such a result opens the possibility of having different effective electron - phonon couplings associated to different physical quantities .",
    "one example of such a peculiarity is given by the different dependence of the coefficients of the isotope effects on @xmath1 and on the effective charge carriers mass @xmath20 upon the adiabatic parameter @xmath21.@xcite    the features listed above are all consequences of the complex behavior of the first vertex corrections ( in the normal and superconducting states ) .",
    "therefore a detailed analysis of the nonadiabaticity in the electron - phonon problem requires a detailed study of the nonadiabatic diagrams .",
    "other attempts in similar directions have been made also since before the discovery of high-@xmath1 materials .",
    "for example in ref . , the eliashberg equations have been modified by taking into account the first vertex corrections in the context of plasmon - mediated superconductivity .",
    "however in this case the vertex was considered only in the @xmath22 regime which gives negative nonadiabatic contributions and lowers @xmath1 .",
    "other authors have studied the vertex corrections using different approximation schemes which apply only in some particular region of the ( @xmath23 ) plane.@xcite finally , calculations based on the ward identity have led to contrasting results . in ref .",
    ", for example , a strong suppression of @xmath1 contrasts with the strong enhancement found in ref .. all these contraddictory results come from particular approximations which predilige different limits of the vertex function . to be more specific , in refs .",
    "the @xmath24 regime was considered while in ref .",
    "the vertex was evaluated in the @xmath16 limit .",
    "so far , the most accurate results on vertex corrections are given by numerical calculations which do not privilege any particular region of the ( @xmath23 ) plane.@xcite    it is certainly true that the value of @xmath15 depends on the characteristic of the specific material one wants to investigate , however it is not completely clear the reason of such a complex behavior of the vertex function . in this paper",
    "we try clarify this point by investigating the physics behind the vertex function .",
    "concerning the theory of nonadiabatic superconductivity , the interpretation of the nonadiabatic corrections in terms of physical processes will help to identify the characteristic of the materials which can lead to an enhancement of the critical temperature .    in this paper",
    "we first summarize the behavior of the vertex function for different values of the ratio @xmath25 and of the electron - density @xmath26 . in section",
    "[ limiting ] we focus on the one - electron case and the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath27 .",
    "for these two cases the interpretation in terms of physical mechanisms turns out to be particularly straightforward .",
    "the last section is devoted to a general discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we consider the electron - phonon vertex correction and its behavior as a function of the adiabatic parameter @xmath25 and the electron density @xmath26 . in the following analysis ,",
    "we neglect the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "therefore we consider an hamiltonian describing electrons with dispersion @xmath28 interacting with phonons via a momentum dependent electron - phonon matrix element @xmath29 :    @xmath30    here , @xmath31 is the phonon frequency , assumed to be dispersionless for simplicity , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with wave number vector @xmath34 and spin @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for phonons with momentum @xmath38 .    the thermal green s function for the electron @xmath39 satisfies the usual dyson equation :    @xmath40    where we have used the four - momentum representation @xmath41 .",

    "we consider the phonons as already renormalized and we interpret eq.([di ] ) in a phenomenological way",

    "[ fig1]b , we show the expansion of the vertex function up to the first correction : @xmath52 , where the vertex correction @xmath53 is given by the following expression :    @xmath54    the aim of the present paper is to provide a physical interpretation of the above vertex correction . in this way",
    ", we should be able also to interpret in terms of physical processes its complex behavior already pointed out in refs . and that we remind here briefly .",
    "first , migdal s theorem states that the order of magnitude of the vertex correction ( [ vertice0 ] ) is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the electron - phonon coupling and @xmath57 is the fermi velocity . since in conventional metals @xmath58 and the momentum transfer",
    "@xmath0 is of order of the debye momentum @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the vertex correction @xmath61 can be therefore safely neglected and @xmath62 .    however , when @xmath31 is of the same order of @xmath5 or when @xmath63 the vertex correction is no longer negligible",
    "this situation can be outlined by approximating the electron propagators @xmath64 with their free electron form @xmath65 . in this way ,",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we plot the vertex correction @xmath61 at half filling as a function of the exchanged frequency @xmath68 and for different values of the dimensionless momentum transfer @xmath69 . for simplicity",
    ", the external electron frequency @xmath70 has been set equal to zero . in the figure",
    "we notice that @xmath61 can assume positive and negative values depending on the ratio @xmath71 : for @xmath72 the vertex is positive while for @xmath73 the vertex becomes negative .",
    "this complex behavior is found also for more realistic band models@xcite and it is also reflected in the different values the vertex assumes in the dynamic and static limits .",
    "in fact , within the same approximation scheme used in the calculations reported in fig . [ fig2 ] , the static limit @xmath74 is negative : @xmath75 , while the dynamic one @xmath76 is instead positive : @xmath77.@xcite the vertex correction is therefore non - analytic in @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "however this non - analyticity is removed when we consider the case of only one electron coupled to the lattice . in this situation the electron distribution functions in ( [ vertice1 ] ) are striktly zero@xcite and the vertex correction reduces to :    @xmath80,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and it is straightforward to realize that the dynamic and static limits of eq.([vertice2 ] ) are in fact equal .    therefore @xmath53 has a strong dependence on the exchanged frequency and momentum , and in particular is non - analytic in ( @xmath78,@xmath79 ) , only when the electron density is finite .",
    "in fact , like in other response functions , the non - analyticity of the vertex correction is given by hole - particle excitations which are present in eq.([vertice1 ] ) .",
    "these hole - particle processes can be explicitly singled out by rearranging eq.([vertice1 ] ) in the following way :    @xmath81 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sum_{{\\bf k}'}g^{2}_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf k } ' } \\frac{\\omega_0 ^ 2 } { ( i\\omega_k+i\\omega_q-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q}})^2-\\omega_0 ^ 2 }   \\frac{f(\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q}})-f(\\epsilon_{{\\bf k } ' } ) } { \\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q}}-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'}-i\\omega_q } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term , @xmath82 , has equal dynamic and static limits and it reduces to eq.([vertice2 ] ) in the one electron case . in the next section",
    "we shall show that @xmath82 stems from the polarization of the lattice induced by the electrons and it is basically a single electron process .",
    "the second term of eq.([vertice2bis ] ) , @xmath83 , has instead a non - zero static limit and vanishes in the dynamic limit .",
    "it is therefore this term that is responsible for the different values of the dynamic and static limits of the vertex function ( [ vertice1 ] ) when the electron density is finite . as it is clear from the expression in eq.([vertice2bis ] ) , the behavior of @xmath83 is governed by particle - hole excitations since the factor    @xmath84 } { \\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q}}-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'}-i\\omega_q}+ \\frac{f(\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'})[1-f(\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q } } ) ] } { \\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'}-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q}}+i\\omega_q } , \\ ] ]    describes particle - hole pairs creation .",
    "the reason of having different values of the static and dynamic limits is contained just in eq.([p - h ] ) .",
    "in fact , the particle - hole excitation processes depend strongly on the available phase space as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we show schematically the process given by the last term of eq.([p - h ] ) . for zero exchanged frequency , @xmath78 , particle - hole excitations are present when @xmath85 , and this condition is obtained by placing the hole and the electron close to the fermi surface . on the other hand ,",
    "when the exchanged frequency is nonzero , the particle - hole excitations vanishes linearly with the momentum transfer @xmath38 when @xmath86 . in the following ,",
    "we show that the physical process which leads to particle - hole excitations in @xmath83 is given by the exchange part of the phonon mediated electron - electron interaction .    from the above discussion",
    ", we have seen that the two contributions @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the vertex function @xmath61 have different behaviors .",
    "therefore the problem of finding the physical interpretation of the vertex @xmath61 can be simplified by looking separately at @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this can be done by considering particular limiting cases .",
    "for example , in the limit of one electron in the system , the particle - hole contributions vanish so that @xmath87 and we are left only with @xmath82 in the form of eq.([vertice2 ] ) . on the other hand , as it is clear from eq.([vertice2bis ] ) , when we employ @xmath88 limit ( non - retarded phonon propagator ) for a finite electron density , the polarization part @xmath82 vanishes and the vertex is determined entirely by @xmath89 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the one electron and @xmath88 limits becomes straightforward if we introduce an external potential @xmath90 which couples to the electron density .",
    "in fact , when the coupling to the lattice is absent , this potential modifies the electron distribution in a way which depends on the explicit form of @xmath90 . however , when the electrons interact with the phonons , the response of the electrons to the external potential changes because of the electron - phonon coupling . this situation can be described in terms of an effective potential @xmath91 . actually , the vertex function is part of the effective potential , so that we can interpret the vertex correction in terms of the physically more intuitive @xmath91 .    in the next section",
    "therefore we study the response of the electrons to the external potential @xmath90 for both the one electron case and the @xmath88 limit .",
    "first we consider the case of only one electron in the system . in this situation ,",
    "the particle - hole contributions of the vertex function vanish and the second term of eq.([vertice2bis ] ) , @xmath83 , is zero . therefore the vertex is given by the one electron limit of @xmath82 , eq.([vertice2 ] ) , which at zero temperature reduces to :    @xmath92    as already pointed out before , the dynamic and static limits of @xmath82 coincide and , by employing the same approximation scheme of refs .",
    ", the @xmath79 , @xmath78 limit becomes :    @xmath93    where we have neglected the external electron frequency @xmath70 and @xmath94 is the electronic bandwidth .",
    "our aim is to find the physical origin of eq.([vertice3 ] ) and to explain the reason why the limit in eq.([verlim ] ) is positive . to this end , we approach the problem by reasoning in terms of the electron response to an external potential @xmath90.@xcite    let us for the moment neglect the electron - phonon interaction . for simplicity , we assume also that , in the absence of the external perturbation @xmath90 , the electron wavefunction for the state @xmath34 and energy @xmath28 is well described by a simple plane - wave @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the volume .    a nonzero external perturbation @xmath90 modifies the electronic wavefunction which , to the first order of the time - independent perturbation theory , is given by :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 . if we consider @xmath99 to be given by a potential well of the form :    @xmath100    then the density of probability @xmath101 of finding a slow electron at position @xmath102 is enhanced inside the potential well and lowered outside the region @xmath103 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we plot @xmath104 for @xmath105 by a dashed line . in the lower panel of the same figure we also plot the potential well @xmath106 of eq.([ustat ] ) ( dashed line ) .",
    "now we study how the above picture is modified when the electron is weakly coupled to the lattice vibrations .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the lattice is more polarized where the probability of finding the electron is large , that is inside the potential well ( for @xmath34 small ) .",
    "the lattice polarization , in turns , provides an attractive potential which is added to the external one .",
    "we can study this situation by replacing @xmath107 in eq.([wave1 ] ) by the wavefunction modified by the coupling to the lattice vibrations:@xcite    @xmath108    in this way , the new electron wavefunction in the presence of the external potential reduces to    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the electron dispersion modified by the electron - phonon coupling and @xmath111 is the effective external potential which results from the lattice polarization :    @xmath112.\\ ] ]    the second term in square brackets is just the electron - phonon vertex correction ( [ vertice3 ] ) calculated for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , _ i.e. _ , at the poles of the incoming and outcoming electron lines of the vertex diagram of fig .",
    "the vertex correction for the one - electron case is therefore part of the effective potential arising from the lattice polarization . from the above discussion",
    ", the lattice polarization should in general amplify the potential seen by the electron .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical results reported in fig.[fig4 ] , where in the lower panel we plot the fourier transform of the effective potential ( [ uffa2 ] ) for @xmath105 ( solid line ) .",
    "moreover , the enhanced potential leads to an enhanced probability of finding the electron in the vicinity of the potential well ( solid line in the upper panel of fig.[uffa2 ] ) .    at this point",
    "it is straightforward to understand why the @xmath86 limit of the vertex function for one electron is positive ( see eq.([verlim ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath105 , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 means the average over the volume of the system , and    @xmath117    of course the treatement of the problem followed in this section does not consider the effect of the other electrons when the electron density @xmath26 is finite .",
    "this effect is partially contained in the general expression of @xmath82 given by eq.([vertice2 ] ) which in fact can be interpreted along the same lines followed in this section by taking into account the fermionic statistics of the electrons .",
    "however , @xmath82 is basically a single electron process and it belongs to the class of processes for which the same electron can generate a phonon at a certain time @xmath118 and then absorb it at a later time @xmath119 .",
    "such kind of processes are consequence of the retarded phonon propagation . on the other hand , for many electrons systems , a different kind of processes are those for which an electron generates a phonon which is absorbed by a different electron .",
    "this is a many - electrons process which is not contained in @xmath82 but it is given by @xmath83 , which is in fact determined by particle - hole excitations .    in the next section we provide an interpretation for the physical origin of @xmath83 .",
    "as anticipated before , we will introduce an external potential and we will consider the resulting effective potential by employing the @xmath27 limit for which @xmath82 vanishes and the interpretation of @xmath83 is particularly simple .",
    "let us consider the electron - phonon coupled system in the limit @xmath120 .",
    "in order to have non - trivial results , we perform this limit in such a way that the quantity @xmath121 remains finite . from eq.([vertice2bis ] ) , @xmath122 and the vertex function reduces to :    @xmath123    as we have seen before , this term has different dynamic and static limits , and in particular we have :    @xmath124    where the last equality holds true at small temperatures and @xmath3 is the electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "although we can interpret the zero value of the dynamic limit as due to the vanishing contribution of the hole - particle excitation contribution , the reason why the static limit is negative remains unclear . in this section",
    "we try to clarify this point by considering the problem of the electron response to an external potential which couples to the electron density .",
    "the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath120 transforms the electron - phonon interaction into an effective non - retarded electron - electron interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian can be obtained by integrating out the phononic degress of freedom and then taking the @xmath120 limit .",
    "the result is :    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the electron density operator :    @xmath127    now let us consider the response of the system to the external potential @xmath90 .",
    "since the electrons are interacting through @xmath121 , the response depends in general on the whole electron configuration . the simplest way in order to deal with this problem is to perform the hartree - fock approximation in the four - operator term in eq.([haminf ] ) .",
    "this approach is equivalent to consider anti - symmetrized states of @xmath128 independent one - electron wavefunctions and leads to the random phase approximation for the effective potential seen by the electrons .",
    "when we apply the hartree - fock approximation , the interaction term in eq.([haminf ] ) becomes :    @xmath129    and , after a manipulation of the momenta indexes , the hamiltonian ( [ haminf ] ) can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the hartee - fock potential in the presence of the external perturbation :    @xmath132    the first term in the right hand side is the hartree contribution which results from the potential generated by the electrons regardless the specific electronic configuration .",
    "the last term of eq.([hfpot ] ) is instead the fock contribution which treats the electrons as being dressed by the exchange hole and it comes from the last term of eq.([hfa ] ) .",
    "below we show that the vertex function @xmath83 originates from the fock contribution of eq.([hfpot ] ) , _ i.e. _ , from the exchange term of the phonon mediated electron - electron interaction .    the effective potential given by the redistribution of the electrons",
    "is readily obtained by the linear response theory .",
    "in fact , for small values of @xmath90 , the expectation values appearing in eq.([hfpot ] ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath133    where the first and the last terms in the right hand sides are the expectation values in the absence and in the presence of the external potential , respectively . from eqs.([hfpot]-[exp2 ] ) , @xmath131 can be rewritten as @xmath134 and the hamiltonian ( [ haminf2 ] ) becomes :    @xmath135    where @xmath136 is the hamiltonian in the hartree - fock approximation for @xmath137 and    @xmath138    the above expression is a self - consistent equation because @xmath139 depends implicitly on @xmath91 .",
    "we can repeat the calculations by assuming a time - dependent external potential . in this case , by employing the linear response theory applied to the hamiltonian ( [ haminf3 ] ) , the self - consistent equation for @xmath91 is given by :    @xmath140    where @xmath68 is the matsubara frequency provided by the time - dependence of the external potential and @xmath28 is now the electron dispersion in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "equation ( [ uffacon ] ) is just the random phase approximation applied to the electron - phonon coupled system in the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath120 .",
    "the second term of eq.([uffacon ] ) represents the electron response to @xmath90 governed by the hartree potential while the last term is the correction due to the exchange potential . to the first order in @xmath90 , the last term of eq.([uffacon ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath141 where @xmath83 is the vertex correction in the antiadiabatic limit ( [ verticeinf ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath83 is just the fock contribution to the electronic response to the external potential when @xmath27 .",
    "we show in fig.[fig5 ] the diagramatic respresentation of the self - consistent equation ( [ uffacon ] ) .",
    "the hartree term is represented by the set of bubble diagrams while the fock contribution is given by the ladder contribution which , to the first order in @xmath90 , is the vertex diagram .    at this point",
    "we can explain the behavior of the vertex function in the antiadiabatic limit already outlined in eqs.([dyna],[stat ] ) .",
    "in fact , the negative static limit of equation ( [ stat ] ) can be understood by the following reasoning .",
    "if we consider a static potential , then we must set @xmath78 in eq.([uffacon ] ) . for simplicity let us also consider an attractive potential like for example the one in eq.([ustat ] ) .",
    "if we neglect the fock contribution , the electrons will tend to form a cloud around the potential well and an added electron will experience an effective potential given by the bare well plus the electron cloud .",
    "since the phonon mediated el - el interaction is attractive such an effective potential will be stronger than the bare one .",
    "however , when we consider the effect of pauli principle , the electron becomes dressed by the exchange hole which repels the other electrons .",
    "therefore the net effect of the pauli principle is to weaken the electron - electron attraction and this weakening is reflected in the negative sign of the exchange term . in conclusion , in the anti - adiabatic limit , the negative sign of the vertex function for @xmath78 , eq.([stat ] ) , is esclusively due to the exchange effect which lower the phonon mediated electron - electron interaction .",
    "this picture is still valid when we take into account the retardation of the phonon - mediated electron - electron interaction ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "in fact the last term of eq.([vertice2bis ] ) can be interpreted as the fock - like contribution for a retarded potential .",
    "from the above analysis , we have seen that the vertex function results from electron - phonon processes of different origins .",
    "in fact , we have shown that the vertex @xmath61 can be decomposed into two different contributions : @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the first one is the result of the lattice polarization as induced by the electron motion . at low frequencies ,",
    "this term leads to a positive contribution to the electron - phonon interaction and tends to enhance the pairing .",
    "moreover , @xmath82 is basically a single electron process .",
    "the second term , @xmath83 , is instead due to the exchange effect of the phonon mediated electron - electron interaction .",
    "since @xmath83 is basically an exchange , it tends to reduce the electron - phonon effective pairing .",
    "the presence of @xmath83 is equivalent to have a lattice polarization effect due to an electron which is moving with its exchange hole .",
    "moreover , since the exchange term gives rise to particle - hole excitations , @xmath83 is sensitive to the momentum transfer and the exchanged frequency of the electron - phonon scattering process and it gives rise to the different values of the dynamic and static limits of the vertex function .",
    "in particular , in the dynamic limit the hole - particle excitation vanish and the vertex is given only by its polarization part @xmath82 , while in the static limit the particle - hole excitations give rise to the exchange part which lower the effective electron - phonon scattering .    from the above results and discussion , it is therefore straightforward to identify scenarios in which the vertex correction can give rise to an enhancement of the effective electron - phonon coupling . in fact",
    ", an enhancement can be automatically obtained if the exchange effects become less important .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , when the charge carrier density is low , so that the average distance between electrons can exceed the size of the exchange hole leading to a negligible @xmath83 . in this way we can understand the results reported in ref . where it is shown that , by reducing the charge carrier density , the vertex correction enhances the effective coupling .",
    "a more interesting situation in favour of an enhancement of the vertex corrected electron - phonon coupling is given by considering only small @xmath38 scattering in the electron - phonon interaction . in fact , for a small enough momentum transfer , say @xmath143 , the particle - hole contributions ( [ p - h ] ) have little weight and the negative exchange term @xmath83 becomes negligible .",
    "this result therefore clarifies on physical grounds why the effective nonadiabatic electron - phonon interaction and so the superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 is enhanced by the vertex corrections when the electron - phonon interaction is only via small momentum transfer.@xcite    it is important to stress that several works have shown how strong electronic correlations can lead to an electron - phonon interaction peaked at small momentum transfer.@xcite therefore strong electronic correlations can have a positive role in enhancing the nonadiabatic effective electron - phonon coupling by introducing a small upper cut - off on the momentum transfer .",
    "however , in the light of the results presented in this work , we can more generally say that strong electronic correlations tend to suppress the particle - hole excitations consequently reducing the negative contribution of the exchange term @xmath83 in the vertex .    in conclusion ,",
    "the two situations listed above , electron - phonon interaction with small momentum transfer ( or more generally the suppression of the particle - hole excitations due to strong electronic correlations ) and small carrier concentration , are both present in high-@xmath1 materials suggesting that the vertex corrections can enhance the pairing and give rise to high-@xmath1 superconductivity ."

    "<S> the electron - phonon vertex correction has a complex structure both in momentum and frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this structure on the basis of physical considerations and we show how the vertex correction can be decomposed into two terms with different physical origins . in particular , the first term describes the lattice polarization induced by the electrons and it is essentially a single - electron process whereas the second term is governed by the particle - hole excitations due to the exchange part of the phonon - mediated electron - electron interaction . we show that by weakening the influence of the exchange interaction the vertex takes mostly positive values giving rise to an enhanced effective coupling in the scattering with phonons . </S>",
    "<S> this weakening of the exchange interaction can be obtained by lowering the density of the electrons , or by considering only long - ranged ( small @xmath0 ) electron - phonon couplings . </S>",
    "<S> these findings permit to understand why in the high-@xmath1 materials the small carrier density and the long ranged electron - phonon interaction may play a positive role in enhancing @xmath1 . </S>",
