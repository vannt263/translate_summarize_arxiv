    "over the past several years , strongly correlated electron systems with quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) ladder structures have received much attention theoretically and experimentally .",
    "experimental studies have received much impetus , since cuprate compounds containing such structures have been fabricated recently.@xcite    the idea was inspired theoretically in 1986 , when schulz@xcite conjectured the following . if we consider a gas of repulsively interacting electrons on a ladder , the undoped system will be a mott insulator , so that we may consider the system as an @xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg magnet on a ladder .",
    "then an af ladder with @xmath1-legs should be similar to a af @xmath2 single chain , which is exactly haldane s",
    "system.@xcite for the latter haldane s conjecture predicts that the spin excitation should be gapless for a half - odd - integer spin ( @xmath1 : odd ) or gapful for an integer spin ( @xmath1 : even ) .",
    "if the situation would be similar in ladders , a ladder having an even number of legs will have a spin gap , which should indicate that the ground state is a ` spin liquid ' where the quantum fluctuation is so large that spins can not order . on the other hand",
    "an odd number of legs will have gapless spin excitations , which should indicate that the ground state has an af order .",
    "the presence of a spin gap in the former case may be a good news for superconductivity , since , there is a body of ideas dictating that a way to obtain superconductivity is to carrier - dope a system that has a spin gap in the course of the study of high-@xmath3 superconductivity .",
    "such a scenario has been put forward by rice _",
    "et al._@xcite    as far as the spin gap is concerned , both theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies on the undoped - ladder systems have indeed supported the conjecture .",
    "the spin - gap conjecture has recently been confirmed experimentally@xcite .",
    "namely , a class of cuprates , sr@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 , has @xmath7-leg ladders on a cuo@xmath8 plane , and the two - leg ladders in srcu@xmath8o@xmath9 exhibit a spin - liquid behavior characteristic of finite spin - correlation lengths , while the three - leg ladders in sr@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 have an af behavior .",
    "rice _ et al .",
    "_ have further conjectured for doped systems that an even - numbered ladder should have a dominant interchain _ d - wave - like _ pairing correlation as expected from the persistent spin gap away from half - filling.@xcite the conjecture is partly based on an exact diagonalization study for finite systems for a two - leg @xmath11 ladder by dagotto _",
    "et al._@xcite this was then followed by analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite works on the doped @xmath11 ladder , which support the dominant pairing correlation in a certain region . in the phase diagram",
    ", the region for the dominant pairing correlation appears at lower values of exchange coupling @xmath12 than in the case of a single chain . experimentally uehara _",
    "et al._@xcite have recently observed superconductivity in a two - leg ladder material sr@xmath13ca@xmath14cu@xmath15o@xmath16 under high pressures .",
    "the hubbard models on ladders are also of interest , since the hubbard model may be regarded as an effective model for cuprates ( fig.1 ) .",
    "since there is no exact solution for the hubbard ladder , a most reliable analytical method at present is the weak - coupling theory,@xcite which , in the continuum limit , linearizes the band structure around the fermi points to treat the interaction with a perturbative renormalization group .",
    "the weak - coupling theory has been applied to the two - leg hubbard ladder .",
    "@xcite at half - filling , the system reduces to a spin - liquid insulator having both charge and spin gaps@xcite with a finite sdw correlation length .",
    "although one might expect that the hubbard ladder would not exhibit a sizeable spin gap at half - filling unlike the @xmath11 ladder , the spin gap for the hubbard model estimated with dmrg by noack _",
    "et al._@xcite is as large as 0.13@xmath17k for @xmath18ev for @xmath19 with @xmath20 , which should correspond to the cuprates ) .",
    "the magnitude of the spin gap is comparable with the spin gap ( @xmath21 400k ) experimentally estimated from the magnitude of susceptibility for srcu@xmath8o@xmath9 .",
    "when the carrier is doped , the weak - coupling theory supports the dominance of the pairing correlation whose symmetry is the same as that of the @xmath11 ladder .",
    "the relevant scattering processes at the fixed point in the renormalization flow are the pair - tunneling process across the bonding and the anti - bonding bands ( fig.2 ) , and the backward - scattering process within each band .",
    "the importance of the pair - tunneling across the two bands ( which exists in two or larger numbers of legs ) for the dominance of pairing correlation in the two - leg hubbard ladder is reminiscent of the suhl - kondo mechanism , that was proposed back in the 1950 s for superconductivity in the transition metals with two ( s- and d - like ) bands.@xcite muttalib and emery have shown another example of the pair - tunneling mechanism for superconductivity with purely repulsive interactions.@xcite more recently , the superconductivity in @xmath22 model , which may be relevant for the chains that alternate with the ladder layers in the cuprates@xcite , has also been studied analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite as a 1d ladder - like system .",
    "[ fig : twolegb ]    the properties of the weak - coupling hubbard ladder are similar to those of the @xmath11 ladder for the regime where the pairing correlation is dominant : in addition to the existence of the spin gap , the _ duality relation_@xcite , which suggests that the exponent for the pairing correlation @xmath23 should be reciprocal to that for the @xmath24 cdw correlation @xmath25 , holds in both the weak - coupling hubbard ladder and the @xmath11 ladder.@xcite here @xmath26 is the critical exponent for the gapless charge mode , which tends to unity in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the similarity may come from the form of the excitation gaps in the bosonization description . in both @xmath11 and hubbard ladders@xcite ,",
    "the only gapless mode is a charge mode with none of the spin modes being gapless ( ` c1s0 ' phase in the language of the weak - coupling theory@xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a serious reservation for the weak - coupling theory .",
    "first , whether the model in the continuous limit is indeed equivalent to the lattice model is not obvious .",
    "more serious is the problem that the perturbational renormalization group is guaranteed to be valid only for an infinitesimally small interaction strengths in principle . specifically , when there is a gap in the excitation , the renormalization flows into a strong - coupling regime , so that the perturbation theory may well break down even for small interaction strengths .",
    "a way to check the reliability of the weak - coupling theory is to treat finite systems with larger @xmath27 with numerical calculations such as exact diagonalization , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , or quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite .",
    "numerical calculations , on the other hand , have drawbacks due to finite - size effects . thus the weak - coupling theory and the numerical methods should be considered as being complementary .",
    "specifically , the dominance of the pairing correlation is indeed a subtle problem in numerical calculations .",
    "existing numerical results@xcite do appear to be controversial , where some of the results are inconsistent with the weak - coupling prediction as detailed in sec.ii .",
    "if we ignore these controversies , most of the existing theories support the dominance of the pairing correlation in the doped two - leg ladders .",
    "then , an even more important unresolved problem for superconductivity in the doped ladders is the ` even - odd ' conjecture .",
    "one can naively expect that the absence of spin gaps in odd - numbered legs will signify an absence of dominating pairing correlation , which will end up with an ` even - odd conjecture for superconductivity ' .",
    "indeed there has not been works looking into the pairing correlation functions for the three - leg ladder , which is the simplest realization of odd - numbered legs .",
    "et al._@xcite have studied two holes doped in the @xmath11 ladders at half - filling to find that two holes are bound in even - numbered ( two or four ) legs , while they are not in odd - numbered ( three or five ) legs , but ( i)the existence of a binding energy for two carriers is not directly connected with the occurrence of superconductivity , and ( ii)the @xmath28-@xmath12 model and the hubbard model may exhibit different behaviors .",
    "thus the second purpose of the present paper is to study the pairing correlation in hubbard ladder models with three legs as compared with the two - leg case .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows .",
    "we first study the two - leg hubbard ladder model@xcite having intermediate interaction strengths with the qmc method in sec.ii .",
    "a new ingredient in this study is that we pay a special attention to the non - interacting ( @xmath29 ) single - particle energy levels which are discrete in finite systems .",
    "we have found that if we make the levels on the two bands aligned ( within an energy that is smaller than the spin gap ) to mimic the thermodynamic limit , the weak - coupling result ( an enhanced pairing correlation in the present case ) is in fact reproduced for intermediate @xmath27 .",
    "further we check the effects of the inter- and intra - band umklapp - scattering processes , which are expected to be present at the special band fillings from the weak - coupling theory@xcite .",
    "in sec.iii we study three(odd)-leg hubbard ladder model ( fig.3 ) with the weak - coupling theory@xcite using the enumeration of gapless modes by arrigoni.@xcite the system has one gapless spin mode and two gapful spin modes .",
    "thus the gapful and the gapless spin modes coexist .",
    "the existence of the gapful modes is a result of the relevant interband pair - tunneling process across the top and the bottom bands ( fig.4 ) .",
    "we find that this gives rise to a dominant pairing correlation across the central and the edge chains reflecting the gapful spin modes , which coexists with the subdominant but power - law decaying sdw correlation reflecting the gapless spin mode .",
    "thus the suhl - kondo - like mechanism for superconductivity exists not only in two - leg systems but also in a three(odd)-leg system as well , while the sdw correlation also survives as expected .",
    "schulz@xcite also found similar results independently .",
    "[ fig : hubbard3 ]    [ fig : threelegb ]    we then study the three - leg hubbard ladder model in sec.iv with a qmc calculation@xcite as in the two - leg case .",
    "the technique to detect the enhanced pairing correlation in the two - leg case is also valid in the three - leg case .",
    "we found that the enhancement of the pairing correlation persists for the intermediate interaction strengths .",
    "we also study the effects of the umklapp processes at special band fillings as in the two - leg case .",
    "the above numerical calculations for two or three legs are performed in a condition that the one - body energy levels are close to each other .",
    "we believe this condition mimics the situation in the thermodynamic limit . in sec.v , a circumstantial evidence for this is given by a qmc calculation of the pairing correlation in the 1d attractive hubbard model , which can be exactly solved with the bethe ansatz@xcite , so that the exact asymptotic form of the correlation functions and the values of the spin gap are known at arbitrary values of parameters .",
    "in this section , we study the pairing correlation for the two - leg hubbard ladder ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - leg hubbard ladder is given in standard notations as @xmath30 where @xmath31 specifies the chains and @xmath32 is the intra(inter)-chain hopping .    from an analytical point of view , if the system is free from umklapp processes , the weak - coupling theory with the bosonization combined with the renormalization - group techniques @xcite has indeed shown that the the two - leg hubbard ladder has a spin gap and that the correlation function of the interchain _ d - wave - like _ pairing order parameter , @xmath33 , decays as @xmath34 as a result of the relevant pair - tunneling process ( fig.2 ) , where @xmath35 is the critical exponent for the total - charge - density mode being only gapless and tends to unity in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "since sdw and @xmath36 cdw correlations have to decay exponentially in the presence of a spin gap in a two - leg ladder , the only phase competing with pairing correlation will be @xmath24 cdw correlation , which should decay as @xmath37 .",
    "hence the pairing correlation dominates over all the others if @xmath38 . in numerical calculations",
    ", however , the dominance of the pairing correlation in the hubbard ladder appears to be a subtle problem .",
    "namely , a dmrg study by noack _ et al . _ for the doped hubbard ladder with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and",
    "@xmath20 shows no enhancement of the pairing correlation over the @xmath29 result@xcite , while they do find an enhancement at @xmath41@xcite .",
    "asai performed a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculation for a 36 rungs ladder with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath41@xcite , in which no enhancement of the pairing correlation was found .",
    "on the other hand , yamaji _ et al . _ have found an enhancement for the values of the parameters when the lowest anti - bonding band levels for @xmath29 approach the highest occupied bonding band levels , although their results have not been conclusive due to the small system sizes ( @xmath44 rungs).@xcite thus , the existing analytical and numerical results appear to be controversial in the two - leg hubbard ladder .",
    "another point is that the above results are obtained away from special fillings where the umklapp - scattering processes are irrelevant .",
    "recently , balents and fisher@xcite proposed a weak - coupling phase diagram ( fig.5 ) which displays the numbers of the gapless spin and charge phases on the @xmath45 plane ( where @xmath7 is the band filling ) .",
    "the effects of the umklapp processes are also discussed there . at half - filling the interband",
    "umklapp processes become relevant resulting in a spin - liquid insulator in which the pairing correlation decays exponentially .",
    "in addition , the intraband umklapp process within the bonding band becomes relevant resulting in a gap in one charge mode in a certain parameter region where the bonding band is reduced to a half - filled band .",
    "this phase is called ` c1s2 ' phase because there are one gapless and two gapfull charge modes , while the phase at half - filling is called ` c0s0 ' phase because there is no gapless phase .",
    "we can expect that the pairing correlation decays exponentially or is at least suppressed reflecting the existence of the charge gap , although the direct calculation of the pairing correlation has not been done .",
    "thus we also study the effects of the umklapp processes in this section , keeping in mind the above weak - coupling results .",
    "[ fig : balents ]    in the remaining of this section , we perform an extensive projector qmc calculation@xcite to investigate the ground state correlation function @xmath46 for the pairing in the hubbard ladder@xcite with @xmath47 , especially in order to clarify the origin of the discrepancies among the existing results .",
    "we conclude that the discreteness of energy levels in finite systems affects the pairing correlation enormously .",
    "the details of the qmc calculation are the following .",
    "we assumed the the periodic boundary conditions along the chain direction , @xmath48 ( where @xmath1 labels the rungs ) and took the non - interacting fermi sea as the trial state the projection imaginary time @xmath49 was taken to be @xmath50 .",
    "we need such a large @xmath49 to ensure the convergence of especially the long - range part of the pairing correlation .",
    "this sharply contrasts with the situation for single chains , where @xmath51 suffices for the same sample length as considered here .",
    "the large value of @xmath49 , along with a large on - site repulsion @xmath27 , makes the negative - sign problem serious , so that the calculation is feasible for @xmath52 . in the trotter decomposition , the imaginary time increment @xmath53(number of trotter slices ) ]",
    "is taken to be @xmath54 .",
    "we have concentrated on band fillings for which the closed - shell condition ( no degeneracy in the non - interacting fermi sea ) is met .",
    "we set @xmath55 in the remaining of this section .    in the beginning",
    "we show in fig.6 the result for @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 and the band filling @xmath60 electrons/ ( 30 rungs @xmath61 2 legs ) .",
    "the @xmath29 result ( dashed line ) for these two values of @xmath62 are identical because the fermi sea remains unchanged .",
    "however , if we turn on @xmath27 , the 5% change in the @xmath63 is enough to cause a dramatic change in the pairing correlation : for @xmath57 the correlation has a large enhancement over the @xmath29 result at large distances , while the enhancement is not seen for @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig : fig21a ]    [ fig : fig21b ]    in fact we have deliberately chosen these values to control the alignment of the discrete energy levels at @xmath29 .",
    "namely , when @xmath57 , the single - electron energy levels of the bonding and anti - bonding bands for @xmath29 lie close to each other around the fermi level with the level offset ( @xmath64 in fig.7 ) being as small as 0.004 , while they are staggered for @xmath58 with the level offset of 0.1 .",
    "on the other hand , the size of the spin gap is known to be around @xmath65 for @xmath66,@xcite and is expected to be of the same order of magnitude or smaller for smaller values of @xmath27 .",
    "the present result then suggests that if the level offset @xmath64 is too large compared to the spin gap ( which should be o(0.01 ) for @xmath67,@xcite ) the enhancement of the pairing correlation is smeared .",
    "by contrast , for a small enough @xmath64 , by which an infinite system is mimicked , the enhancement is indeed detected in agreement with the weak - coupling theory , in which the spin gap is assumed to be infinitely large at the fixed point of the renormalization flow .",
    "similar situation is also found in the case of a qmc study of the pairing correlation in the @xmath22 model.@xcite    our result is reminiscent of those obtained by yamaji _ et al._,@xcite who found an enhancement of the pairing correlation in a restricted parameter regime where the lowest anti - bonding levels approach the highest occupied bonding levels .",
    "they conclude that the pairing correlation is dominant when the anti - bonding band ` slightly touches ' the fermi level .",
    "however , our result in fig.6 is obtained for the band filling for which no less than seven out of 30 anti - bonding levels are occupied at @xmath29 .",
    "hence the enhancement of the pairing correlation is seen to be not restricted to the situation where the anti - bonding band edge touches the fermi level .",
    "however , one might consider that the enhancement of the pairing correlation in such a condition for the one - body energy levels should be rather due to finite size effects , although we believe the condition is generally relevant for bulk systems . to clarify this point",
    ", we will further give a circumstantial evidence to justify that the condition for the one - body energy levels is relevant for bulk systems by a qmc study for 1d attractive hubbard model in sec.v .",
    "now , let us more closely look into the form of @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "it is difficult to determine the exponent from results for finite systems , but here we attempt to fit the data by assuming a trial function expected from the weak - coupling theory .",
    "namely , we have fitted the data with the form , @xmath68r_d^{-2}\\ } \\label{tri}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the least - square fit ( by taking logarithm of the data ) .",
    "because of the periodic boundary condition , we have to consider contributions from both ways around , so there are two distances between the @xmath69-th and the @xmath70-th rung , i.e , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the periods of the cosine terms are assumed to be the non - interacting fermi wave numbers of the bonding and the anti - bonding bands in analogy with the single - chain case .",
    "the overall decay should be @xmath73 as in the pure 1d case in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "we have assumed the form @xmath74 as the dominant part of the correlation at large distances because this is what is expected in the weak - coupling theory .",
    "here @xmath75 is the only fitting parameter in the above trial function .",
    "a finite @xmath76 may give some correction , but the result ( solid line in fig.6 ) fits to the numerical result surprisingly accurately with a best - fit @xmath77 .",
    "if we least - square fit the exponent itself as @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 with a similar accuracy .",
    "thus a finite @xmath27 may change @xmath80 , but @xmath81 may be excluded . to fit the short - range part of the data ,",
    "a non - oscillating @xmath82 term is required , which is not present in the weak - coupling theory .",
    "we believe that this is because the weak - coupling theory only concerns with the asymptotic form of the correlation functions .    in fig.7 , we show a result for a larger system size ( 42 rungs ) for a slightly different electron density , @xmath83 with 76 electrons and @xmath84 .",
    "we have again an excellent fit with @xmath85 this time .",
    "[ fig : fig22 ]    in fig.8 , we display the result for a larger @xmath86 .",
    "we again have a long - ranged @xmath56 at large distances , although @xmath56 is slightly reduced from the result for @xmath59 .",
    "this is consistent with the weak - coupling theory , in which @xmath26 is a _ decreasing _ function of @xmath27 so that after the spin gap opens for @xmath87 , the pairing correlation decays faster for larger values of @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig : fig23 ]    now we explore the effects of the umklapp processes . for that purpose",
    "we concentrate on the filling dependence for a fixed interaction @xmath86 .",
    "we have tuned the value of @xmath62 to ensure that the level offset @xmath88 at the fermi level is as small as o(@xmath89 ) for @xmath29 . in this way , we can single out the effects of the umklapp processes from those due to large values of @xmath64 . if we first look at the half - filling ( fig.10 ) , the decaying form is essentially similar to the @xmath29 result . at half - filling ,",
    "the interband umklapp processes emerge and , according to the weak - coupling theory , open a charge gap , which results in an exponential decay of the pairing correlation .",
    "( we should note that there are two kinds of charge gaps .",
    "the one , which is produced by the pair - tunneling processes , causes the long range order of the josephson phase resulting in the enhancement of the pairing correlation , while the other , which is produced by the umklapp processes , causes the long range order of the phase of the cdw resulting in the suppression of the pairing correlation )    [ fig : fig24a ]    [ fig : fig24b ]    it is difficult to tell from our data whether @xmath56 decays exponentially .",
    "this is probably due to the smallness of the charge gap .",
    "in fact , the dmrg study by noack _",
    "et al._@xcite have detected an exponential decay for larger values of @xmath27 , for which a larger charge gap is expected .",
    "when @xmath7 is decreased down to 0.667 ( fig.11 ) , we again observe an absence of enhancement in @xmath56 .",
    "this is again consistent with the weak - coupling theory@xcite : for this band filling , the number of electrons in the bonding band coincides with @xmath90 at @xmath29 ,",
    "i.e. , the bonding band is half - filled .",
    "this will then give rise to _ intraband _ umklapp processes within the bonding band resulting in the ` c1s2 ' phase as discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "the spin gap is destroyed and the singlet - pair of electrons or holes are prevented from forming , so that the pairing correlation will no longer decay slowly there .",
    "al._@xcite have suggested that the suppression of the spin gap and the pairing correlation function around @xmath91 in ref.@xcite may be due to the intraband umklapp process .    in this section ,",
    "we have detected the enhancement of the pairing correlation which is consistent with the weak - coupling theory .",
    "we have also seen that there are three possible causes that reduce the pairing correlation function in the hubbard ladder :    \\(i ) the discreteness of the energy levels ,    \\(ii ) reduction of @xmath26 for large values of @xmath92 , and    \\(iii ) effect of intra- and interband umklapp processes around specific band fillings .",
    "the discreteness of the energy levels is a finite - size effect , while the others are present in infinite systems as well .",
    "we can make a possible interpretation for the existing results in terms of these effects . for 60 electrons on 36 rungs with @xmath41 in ref.@xcite ,",
    "for instance , the non - interacting energy levels have a significant offset @xmath93 between bonding and anti - bonding levels at the fermi level , which may be the reason why the pairing correlation is not enhanced for @xmath43 . for a large @xmath94 in ref.@xcite , ( ii ) and/or ( iii ) in the above",
    "may possibly be important in making the pairing correlation for @xmath20 not enhanced .",
    "the effect ( iii ) should be more serious for @xmath20 than for @xmath41 because the bonding band is closer to the half - filling in the former .",
    "on the other hand , the discreteness of the energy levels might exert some effects as well , since the non - interacting energy levels for a 32-rung ladder with 56 electrons @xmath95 in an open boundary condition have an offset of @xmath96 at the fermi level for @xmath20 while the offset is @xmath97 for @xmath41 .",
    "let us comment on a possible relevance of the present result to the superconductivity reported recently for a cuprate ladder@xcite , especially for the pressure dependence .",
    "the material is sr@xmath13ca@xmath14cu@xmath15o@xmath16 , which contains layers consisting of two - leg ladders and those consisting of 1d chains .",
    "superconductivity is not observed in the ambient pressure , while it appears with @xmath98 under the pressure of 3 gpa or 4.5 gpa , and finally disappears at a higher pressure of 6 gpa .",
    "this material is doped with holes with the total doping level of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is defined as the deviation of the density of electrons from the half - filling .",
    "it has been proposed that at ambient pressure the holes are mostly in the chains , while high pressures cause the carrier to transfer into the ladders@xcite . if this is the case , and if most of the holes are transferred to the ladders at 6 gpa , the experimental result is consistent with the present picture , since there is no enhancement of the pairing correlation for @xmath101 and @xmath102 due to the umklapp processes as we have seen .",
    "evidently , further investigation especially in the large-@xmath27 regime is needed to justify this speculation .",
    "in this section , we study correlation functions for the three(odd)-leg hubbard ladder by the weak - coupling theory . as discussed in sec.i , an increasing fascination in ladder systems has been caused by an ` even - odd ' conjecture for the existence of spin gap by schulz@xcite and independently by rice _",
    "et al._@xcite at half - filling .",
    "when the system is doped with carriers , it is naively supposed that an even - numbered ladder should exhibit superconductivity with the interchain singlet pairing as expected from the persistent spin gap , while an odd - numbered ladder should have the usual @xmath36 sdw reflecting the gapless spin excitations .    theoretically , however ,",
    "whether the ` even - odd ' conjecture for superconductivity continues to be valid for triple chains remains an open question .",
    "there had been no results for the pairing correlation function in the three - leg @xmath11 or hubbard ladder ( fig.3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , arrigoni has looked into a three - leg with weak hubbard - type interactions by the usual perturbational renormalization - group technique , which is quite similar to that developed by balents and fisher for the two - leg case,@xcite to conclude that gapless and gapful spin excitations _ coexist _",
    "there.@xcite    namely , he has actually enumerated the numbers of gapless charge and spin modes on the phase diagram spanned by the doping level and the interchain hopping .",
    "he found that , at half - filling , one gapless spin mode exists for the interchain hopping comparable with the intrachain hopping , in agreement with some experimental results and theoretical expectations ( fig.12 ) .",
    "away from the half - filling , on the other hand , one gapless spin mode is found to remain at the fixed point in the region where the fermi level intersects all the three bands in the noninteracting case . from this , arrigoni argues that the @xmath36 sdw correlation should decay as a power law as expected from experiments .",
    "[ fig : arri ]    on the other hand , his result also indicates that two gapful spin modes exist in addition .",
    "while a spin gap certainly favors a singlet superconducting ( ss ) correlation when there is only one spin mode , we are in fact faced here with an intriguing problem of what happens when gapless and gapful spin modes coexist , since it may well be possible that the presence of gap(s ) in _ some _ out of multiple spin modes may be sufficient for the dominance of a pairing correlation .",
    "furthermore , as discussed below , the gaps of two spin modes emerge as an effect of the _ pair - tunneling process _ across the top and the bottom bands ( fig.4 ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the two - leg case and of the suhl - kondo mechanism .",
    "@xcite these have motivated us , in this section , to actually look at the correlation functions using the bosonization method@xcite at the fixed point away from half - filling .",

    "( as discussed in sec.ii , there are two kinds of charge gaps .",
    "the one , which is produced by the pair - tunneling processes , favors the pairing correlation as in the previous section , while the other , which is produced by the umklapp processes , suppress the pairing correlation as in the present section . )    in the latter case , the umklapp process also becomes relevant resulting in a ` c2s3 ' phase with the two gapless charge modes and three gapless spin modes and the singlet - pair of holes or electrons is prevented from binding .",

    "the umklapp process within the first band in the present case is identified with that in the bonding band in the two - leg case , since the first ( third ) band corresponds to the bonding ( anti - bonding ) band as far as the pairing correlation is concerned as discussed in sec.iii .",
    "given this situation , our motivation here is to look at the pairing correlation and , in addition , to explore in which case the umklapp scattering does or does not affect the pairing correlation .",
    "we study the above two cases and also study the case in which the second band is half - filled .",
    "namely , we wish to see whether both the first and the third bands , which involve the pairing order parameter , are affected by an indirect effect of the umklapp process in the second band .",

    "we have tuned the value of @xmath62 to ensure that the level offset @xmath88 between the first and the third bands at the fermi level is as small as o(@xmath89 ) for @xmath29 to single out the effect of umklapp processes from those due to large values of @xmath64 .",
    "ideally , we should make the single electron energy levels of all the three bands lie close to each other around the fermi level but that is impossible within the tractable system sizes .",
    "however , when the umklapp process is relevant within the first or the third band , the aligned levels of the bands should favor the pairing , so that if the pairing correlation is suppressed , we can infer that the suppression is not an artifact . on the other hand , when the level of the second band is misaligned from @xmath211",
    ", one may naively think that the effect of the umklapp process within the band becomes obscured .",
    "however , the effect of the umklapp processes should in fact be enhanced when the highest occupied level derivate from @xmath211 , since the umklapp processes become well - defined if the highest occupied level is doubly occupied .    in the beginning",
    "we look at the half - filling ( fig.17 ) . indeed , no enhancement of the pairing correlation is found and the over all decaying form is similar to the @xmath29 result as in the two - leg case at half - filling .",

    "possibilities are either the umklapp process is not relevant , or it is relevant but does not affect the other bands . in the latter case , a density - wave correlation might be dominant due to a charge gap opening by the umklapp scattering .",
    "however , at least in the sense of the weak - coupling theory , the charge gap in the second band only enhances the density - wave correlation at long distances from @xmath215 to @xmath216 ( unity , the value of the exponent , comes from the gapless spin mode and it should be independent to @xmath27 ) in the weak - coupling limit and thus the pairing correlation may still remain dominant for small @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig : fig45 ]    although we can not decide which of the above two possibilities applies , we do have a unique situation where the pairing correlation is enhanced _ despite _ the umklapp processes being possible .",
    "this interesting situation does not appear in the two - leg ladder .",
    "lastly , we study the case so that the first band is half - filled when @xmath7 is further decreased and @xmath217 is also decreased ( fig.19 ) . in this case , we again observe no enhancement in @xmath56 , as expected from the weak - coupling theory and the above discussion .",
    "[ fig : fig46 ]    in this section , we have shown with the projector quantum monte carlo method that the enhancement of the pairing correlation expected from the results in the previous section is indeed found even for the intermediate interaction strengths(@xmath218 ) and the interchain hoppings(@xmath47 ) .",
    "the features of the enhancement is similar to that in the two - leg case .",
    "we have also studied the cases where the umklapp processes can be relevant .",
    "especially , we found that the enhancement of the pairing correlation is not affected by the intraband umklapp process within the second band which does not involve the pairing order parameter .",
    "as we have seen in sections 2 ( two - leg ladder ) and 4 ( three - leg ladder ) , qmc result for the pairing correlation in hubbard ladders are consistent with the weak - coupling prediction when the highest occupied level and the lowest unoccupied level ( called the level offset @xmath219 hereafter ) in the relevant free - electron bands are made to lie close to each other .",
    "a similar situation is also found to occur in a qmc study of the single chain with distant transfers ( @xmath22 model).@xcite we believe that small level offsets should be required to mimic the thermodynamic limit ( bulk systems ) , where this quantity is infinitesimal .",

    "otherwise , the results obtained in the previous section may be taken as an uncontrolled finite size effect . in this section",
    "we actually give a circumstantial evidence for justifying that we can indeed quantify this , with which we can tell that the results in the previous sections are meaningful .",

    "let us take a model ( such as the attractive hubbard model with an attractive interaction @xmath220 ) that is known to superconduct .",
    "for a bulk system we know that the pairing correlation should have an slowly decaying asymptotic behavior for arbitrary @xmath221 , but in a numerical calculation such as qmc the tractable system size is limited , so that it is inconceivable that a slowly decaying asymptotic behavior is obtained even for , say , @xmath222 .",
    "so the question is what is the requirement for such an asymptotic behavior to be detectable in finite size systems .",
    "we shall conclude in this section that the level offset as compared with the _ spin gap _ is the key ingredient .",
    "the criterion will also shed light on numerical calculations for systems which may possibly have small spin gaps .    as a case study",
    ", we take here the 1d attractive hubbard model .",

    "if we take the ratio of these values to the level offset @xmath64 around the fermi level , which is @xmath243 , they give values 1.1 and 2.1 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the pairing correlation , which is governed by the spin gap , can not be clearly detected unless @xmath244 is sufficiently large , in agreement with our speculation mentioned at the beginning of the present section . in fact @xmath244 is infinite in a bulk system , and we also assume an infinite @xmath244 in the tomonaga - luttinger theory as well .    in fig.21 , in order to confirm the point away from the half filling ,",
    "we have also looked at @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is smaller than that for @xmath247 .",
    "the power for the pairing correlation is now @xmath248 for @xmath238 form the bethe ansatz .",
    "the qmc result for @xmath238 gives @xmath249 , indicating that the numerical result is rather reliable already at @xmath238 in this case .",
    "if we look at the level offset , @xmath250 is indeed greater than that for @xmath247 and is closer to the case of @xmath251 for @xmath247 .",
    "this result further confirms our view .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in conclusion , we have shown that the effect of the spin gap can be clearly seen in the correlation function of finite size systems only when the size of the gap is sufficiently large compared to the discreteness of the one - body energy levels . combining the results for the hubbard ladders and for the @xmath22 model , we believe that this is the case in general : a criterion for reproducing the correct form of the correlation functions is to make @xmath244 large .",
    "this implies that to reproduce the correct asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions in models having small spin gaps , very large systems are required .",
    "an alternative way is to tune , if possible , the values of the parameters so that @xmath64 becomes small around the fermi level , as we have done for ladders .",
    "one final point is , since @xmath64 is defined as the level offset at @xmath29 , the quantity can become ill - defined for large interactions , where we have to consider that the quantity should be renormalized .",
    "in the present paper , we have studied the pairing correlation in the hubbard ladder with two(even ) or three(odd ) number of legs .",
    "this has been motivated from a conjecture due to rice _",
    "_ that an even - numbered ladder should exhibit dominance of the interchain singlet pairing correlation as expected from the persistent spin gap away from half - filling . naively , one can then expect that an odd - numbered ladder should not exhibit dominance of the pairing correlation reflecting the presence of gapless spin excitations .",
    "we have first considered the two - leg hubbard ladder model . in the weak - coupling theory , in which the interactions are treated with the perturbative renormalization - group method ,",
    "a d - wave like pairing correlation becomes dominant reflecting a spin gap in the two - leg hubbard ladder .",
    "the relevant scattering processes are the pair - tunneling process across the bonding and the anti - bonding bands and the backward - scattering process within each band .",
    "the pair - tunneling process is reminiscent of the suhl - kondo mechanism for superconductivity in the transition metals with a two - band structure .",
    "however , the weak - coupling theory is correct only for infinitesimally small interactions in principle .",
    "thus the calculation for finite interaction @xmath27 is needed , but existing numerical calculations for finite @xmath27 have been controversial .    in sec.ii , we have applied the projector monte carlo method to investigate the pairing correlation function in the ground state for finite @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude that the discreteness of energy levels in finite systems affects the pairing correlation enormously , where the enhanced pairing correlation is indeed detected for intermediate interaction strengths if we tune the parameters so as to align the discrete energy levels of bonding and anti - bonding bands at the fermi level in order to mimic the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the enhancement of the pairing correlation in the @xmath252 case is smaller than that in the @xmath253 case .",
    "this is consistent with the weak - coupling theory in which the pairing correlation decays as @xmath254 ( @xmath26 is the critical exponent of the gapless charge mode ) at long distances and @xmath26 is a _ decreasing _ function of @xmath27 .    in the cases where interband or intraband umklapp process is possible",
    ", the pairing correlation is not enhanced .",
    "this result is also consistent with the weak - coupling theory .",
    "we then moved onto the correlation functions in the three - leg hubbard ladder model in sec.iii . whether the above ` even - odd ' conjecture holds for the simplest - odd ladder ( i.e. the three - leg ladder ) with a plural number of charge and spin modes is an important problem .",
    "this has remained an open question , since there had been no results for the pairing correlation function in the three - leg @xmath11 or hubbard ladder models .",
    "a key is the coexistence of gapless and gapful spin excitations in the doped three - leg hubbard ladder .",
    "this has been analytically shown from the correlation functions starting from the phase diagram obtained by arrigoni@xcite , who enumerated the numbers of the gapless charge and spin modes with the perturbative renormalization - group technique in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "if we turn to the correlation functions , we have found that the coexisting gapful and gapless modes give rise to a peculiar situation where a specific pairing _ across _ the central and edge chains ( roughly a d - wave pairing ) is dominant , while the @xmath36 sdw on the edge chains simultaneously shows a subdominant but still long - tailed ( power - law ) decay associated with the gapless spin mode .",
    "the relevant scattering processes are the pair - tunneling process between the top and the bottom bands and the backward - scattering process within the top and the bottom bands .",
    "the situation is rather similar to the two leg case where the pair - tunneling processes play an important role for the enhanced pairing correlation .",
    "schulz@xcite has independently obtained results for both the sdw and the pairing correlations which are similar to those given in sec.iii .    however , as discussed in the two - leg case , it is not clear whether the weak - coupling results might be applicable only to infinitesimally small interaction strengths . in sec.iv , we have thus checked the pairing correlation in the three - leg hubbard ladder with the qmc method tuning the parameters so as to align the discrete energy levels of the first and third bands at the fermi level as in the two - leg case .",
    "the enhanced pairing correlation is indeed detected even for intermediate interaction strengths in the three - leg ladder .",
    "the enhancement of the pairing correlation in the @xmath252 case is smaller than that in the @xmath253 case as in the two - leg case in sec.ii .",
    "this result is consistent with the weak - coupling theory in sec.iii in a similar reason with that in the two - leg case .",
    "namely , the exponent of the pairing correlation is a decreasing function of @xmath35 s which should decrease with @xmath27 .",
    "various effects of the umklapp processes have also been discussed .",
    "especially , it is found that the enhancement of the pairing correlation is not affected by the intraband umklapp process within the second band which does not involve the pairing order parameter .",
    "the key message obtained in the present paper , is that the dominance of the pairing correlation only requires the existence of gap(s ) in not all but _ some _ of the spin modes .",
    "this is independent to whether the number of legs is even(two ) or odd(three ) .",
    "there are still important open questions .",
    "one is how the hubbard model can possibly be related to real systems such as the cuprates .",
    "specifically , one should study the two - leg and/or three - leg hubbard ladder for larger @xmath27 , where the dominance of the pairing correlation might be lost .",
    "furthermore , the three - leg @xmath11 model should be studied to be compared with the hubbard ladder .",
    "it would also be interesting to further investigate ladder systems with larger numbers of legs .",
    "the hubbard ladders with more large number of legs is also of interest , since it may have a key point to understand the two - dimensional systems .",
    "more recently , lin _ et al._@xcite have examined the weak - coupling phase diagram for the four - leg hubbard ladder where the pairing correlation is the most dominant in wide parameter region .    finally , in sec.v , a qmc study for the pairing correlation in the 1d attractive hubbard model is given .",
    "the model can be exactly solved by bethe ansatz , so that we know the exact form of the correlation functions at long distances and the values of the spin gaps .",
    "a qmc study has shown that the effect of the spin gap can be clearly seen in the pairing correlation function of finite size systems and the behavior at long distances is consistent with the exact result only when the size of the gap is sufficiently large compared to the discreteness of the one - body energy levels .",
    "the result is a circumstantial evidence to justify the enhancement of the pairing correlation in sec.ii and sec.iv and combining this result , we believe that this is the case in general for finite size systems .",

    "<S> in order to shed light whether the ` even - odd conjecture ' ( even numbers of legs will superconduct accompanied by a spin gap while odd ones do not ) for correlated electrons in ladder systems , the pairing correlation is studied for the hubbard model on a two- and three - leg ladders . we have employed both the weak - coupling renormalization group and the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method for strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for the two - leg hubbard ladder , a systematic qmc ( with a controlled level spacings ) has detected an enhanced pairing correlation , which is consistent with the weak - coupling prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the correlation functions in the three - leg hubbard ladder and show that the weak - coupling study predicts the dominant superconductivity , which refutes the naive even - odd conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial point is a spin gap for only some of the multiple spin modes is enough to make the ladder superconduct with a pairing symmetry ( d - like here ) compatible with the gapped mode . </S>",
    "<S> a qmc study for the three - leg ladder endorses the enhanced pairing correlation . </S>"
