    "distributed feedback ( dfb ) lasers are compact and easy - to - use sources of the narrowband coherent radiation . in the dfb lasers ,",
    "the feedback is provided via backward bragg light scattering from the spatially periodic structure formed inside the active medium itself and , hence , is distributed throughout its length .",
    "the idea of such lasers has been put forward and implemented by the authors of refs .",
    "as applied to dye solutions as active media , the spatially periodic structures can be either of stationary @xcite or dynamic ( rapidly reversible ) @xcite character .",
    "it should be noted that the dynamic dfb dye lasers exhibit the highest performance characteristics .",
    "a number of optical schemes of such lasers were developed .",
    "their advantages had been demonstrated , such as a small spectral linewidth , wide tuning range , high efficiency , possibility of the high repetition rate operation without dye solution flow as well as simultaneous generation at two or more wavelengths with independent spectral tuning , etc . @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the most interesting and important feature of the dynamic dfb dye lasers is their ability to produce picosecond pulses both at picosecond and nanosecond excitation @xcite . in the latter case , the use of such lasers represents the simplest way for obtaining single pulses of a few tens of picoseconds duration with possibility of smooth wavelength tuning .    due to their important merits ,",
    "dfb dye lasers are still the subject of steady attention and intensive study by scientists from different research centers ( see some recent publications @xcite ) .    in the dynamic dfb dye lasers ,",
    "excitation of the active medium is generally provided by two converging pump beams with vertical orientation of the electric field vector ( s - polarization ) . in this case , spatially periodic modulation of the resultant pump field intensity is provided along the excited dye region .",
    "fundamentally different type of modulation occurs when the pump beams are orthogonally polarized ( for example , the first one is s - polarized , while the second one is p - polarized ) . under such conditions ,",
    "the pump field intensity is uniform over the excited zone of the dye , while a periodic change of the resultant excitation field polarization takes place . due to the anisotropy of light absorption and emission by dye molecules , the above pump field polarization modulation results in the formation of a transient gain dichroism ( i.e. , polarization ) grating inside the dye solution .",
    "dynamic dfb dye laser action by polarization modulation was experimentally investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite where spectral , threshold and polarization characteristics of a dfb laser pumped by the second harmonic from a nanosecond nd : yag laser were reported . unlike the works mentioned above , in our studies we used the second harmonic generation from a subnanosecond diode - pumped solid - state ( dpss ) nd : lsb microlaser to initiate the dfb lasing by polarization modulation in the dye solution @xcite .",
    "under such condition , the dfb laser exhibited a spectral linewidth of @xmath0 nm ( full width at half - maximum , fwhm ) and the energy conversion efficiency as high as @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted for comparison that , under identical pumping conditions , the dfb lasing by intensity modulation revealed the similar value of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in terms of the spectral linewidth and peak lasing efficiency , the dfb laser based on the dynamic polarization grating is comparable with that employing the `` traditional '' ( i.e. , intensity modulation ) pumping geometry . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no similar results regarding spectral line narrowness and efficiency of the dfb dye lasing by polarization modulation have been reported ever before . at the same time , our results seem to be of an undoubted interest and indicate the potential of these devices .",
    "it is obvious that , for its practical realization , a deeper insight into the operation of such dfb dye lasers is required .",
    "the latter is hardly possible without appropriate theoretical model capable to adequately predict their performance .",
    "since , as far as we know , all existing studies still lack for any theoretical treatment of the properties of such laser devices , here we attempt to fill this gap .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple theoretical model of dfb lasing by polarization modulation and report on the numerical simulations of its dynamics for the case of subnanosecond excitation .",
    "the results obtained reveal that , at moderate pumping rates , a multi - spike emission is provided by a dfb laser , while single picosecond pulse generation takes place at the pump intensities not far from the threshold . as a proof of consistency and usefulness of the proposed model , the output characteristics of the rhodamine 6 g dfb laser excited by two",
    "orthogonally polarized second harmonic beams from a subnanosecond dpss nd : lsb microlaser are presented .",
    "the geometry of the model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the field of the pump beam which forms dfb grating is a sum of two plane waves crossing inside the medium at an angle @xmath4 .",
    "we denote @xmath5 the angle between the pump wave vector and the normal to the surface of the sample ( plane @xmath6 ) .",
    "we assume that the first pump wave is polarized along @xmath7 axis ( s - polarization ) , the second one is polarized in the plane @xmath8 ( p - polarization ) , and the wave generated by the laser propagates along @xmath9 axis .",
    "then , spatial distribution of the total pump electric field can be written ( after time averaging ) as follows , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the amplitudes of the pump waves , @xmath13 are the unit vectors along the corresponding axes , @xmath14 is the wavenumber of the pump waves with the wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "the field ( [ field ] ) gives the periodic change of the polarization state along @xmath9 axis , while its intensity @xmath16 does not depend on position .",
    "interaction of a dye molecule with the field is governed by the value of @xmath17 , the direction of the molecular dipole moment vector being defined as @xmath18 where the angles of the spherical coordinate system @xmath19 ( zenith angle ) and @xmath20 ( azimuth angle ) are counted from @xmath9 and @xmath7 axes , correspondingly . using eqs .",
    "( [ field ] ) and ( [ dipole ] ) , the excitation efficiency for the molecule with dipole moment oriented along angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be calculated by @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the grating period , and the auxiliary functions are @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the coefficients which define the part of the entire pump power contained in both incident waves .",
    "thus , for every molecule orientation , we have the excitation grating which is the result of polarization modulation and is described by eq .",
    "( [ excite ] ) . in order to calculate lasing dynamics",
    ", we use the idea of ref .",
    "let us consider molecules of given orientation separately in maxima and minima of the excitation grating , i.e. for two values of efficiency @xmath26 .",
    "these two values should be substituted in the rate equations which describe temporal dynamics of the excited molecules concentration and density of generated photons . to obtain these equations , we use the rate equations given in refs .",
    "@xcite for dfb laser action by intensity modulation and generalize them on the case of polarization modulation . as a result",

    "the first term on the right side of eq . ( [ concmol ] ) describes the process of molecular excitation under pump influence , while the second and third terms are responsible for spontaneous and stimulated decay of the excited state , respectively .    in order to obtain the equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we need the expressions for average gain coefficients for light polarized along @xmath7 and @xmath34 axes ( s- and p - polarizations ) .",
    "these values are defined as @xmath40 where the gain coefficients in the maxima and minima of the excitation grating can be calculated through @xmath41 then , the equations for average densities of s- and p - polarized photons are as follows , @xmath42 here , the photon life - time in the cavity @xmath43 is proportional to squared amplitude of the gain grating @xcite which , in our case , is equal to @xmath44 ; @xmath45 is the length of the dfb structure .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ concphot ] ) describes spontaneous emission @xcite with a coefficient @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the height of the excited volume , @xmath48 is the spectral factor which determines the fraction of spontaneous emission falling into the laser bandwidth .",
    "the average density of excited molecules is calculated by @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "finally , lasing power can be determined by the expression @xcite @xmath51 , \\label{power}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the planck constant , and the penetration depth @xmath53 of pump beam into the dye solution can be estimated from @xmath54    equations ( [ concmol ] ) and ( [ concphot ] ) are the main relations of our model . solving them numerically and substituting this solution into eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) , we can describe dynamics of power and the polarization properties of dfb lasing by polarization modulation .",
    "let us consider some results of numerical solution of the rate equations presented in the previous section .",
    "calculations were performed for the set of parameters which can be considered typical for the dye - laser systems : pump wavelength @xmath55 nm , laser wavelength @xmath56 nm , absorption and emission cross - sections ( rhodamine 6 g ) @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath58 , concentration of the dye solution @xmath60 mm , refractive index of the solution at the laser wavelength @xmath61 , excited state life - time @xmath62 ns , the length and the height of dfb structure @xmath63 cm and @xmath64 cm , respectively , spectral factor @xmath65 .",
    "the pulse of pump intensity has the gaussian envelope with fwhm @xmath66 ns .",
    "the ratio of intensities of pump beams with s- and p - polarizations is @xmath67 , i.e. the intensity parameters are @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the angle of incidence for pump beams is @xmath70 .",
    "we start our analysis with the laser power dynamics calculated at different pumping levels .",
    "we are interested rather in qualitative relations than in absolute values of laser characteristics .",
    "therefore , we measure pump energy @xmath71 with normalized parameter @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the threshold pump energy . this threshold is determined as the point of abrupt rise of the output power . in absolute units ,",
    "our calculations give @xmath74 @xmath75j for the parameters listed above .    according to our calculations ,",
    "only s - polarized light is generated at low excesses over pump threshold . in this case ,",
    "laser radiation forms a single pulse which , at threshold , appears at the trailing edge of the pump pulse and arises more and more earlier as the pump energy grows .",
    "the example of such s - polarized pulse is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) at @xmath76 .",
    "this single - pulse lasing corresponds to the sharp decrease of the average density @xmath77 of excited molecules presented in the same figure ( dotted curve ) .",
    "it is seen that , at first , the value @xmath77 grows smoothly as a result of pump and then , when it becomes larger than certain level ( which , in general , depends on pump energy ) , the density of excited molecules drops releasing the stored energy in the form of laser radiation . as to generation of p - polarized light under these conditions",
    ", it has low intensity and can not be described by the characteristic bell - shaped envelope [ see the lower panel in fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) ] .",
    "when @xmath78 , generation of the second pulse starts .",
    "this second pulse is p - polarized that is illustrated by the profiles calculated at @xmath79 [ fig . [ fig2](b ) ] . in this case , the dynamics of average density of excited molecules has two well - pronounced peaks which correspond to both laser pulses .",
    "the third pulse appears for @xmath80 and is s - polarized as the first one .",
    "the example of calculated power profiles and behavior of @xmath77 with three maxima are shown in fig . [ fig2](c ) for @xmath81 . finally , when @xmath82 , the fourth pulse is generated . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , at @xmath83 , this fourth pulse contains comparable quantities of both s- and p - polarized radiation .",
    "after these examples , we should consider the energetic characteristics of laser action described by our model .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] demonstrates the full output energy and the energy of s- and p - polarized laser light taken separately as the functions of pump energy .",
    "one can see that appearance of subsequent pulses is characterized by inflection points in the curves depicted in fig .",
    "note that before such inflection point is reached , the plateau occurs where generated energy changes very slightly with pump energy .",
    "this property of the laser system considered seems to be perspective to obtain linearly polarized single pulses with high stability of output energy .",
    "the output characteristics of a dfb dye laser based on the dynamic polarization grating were investigated under subnanosecond excitation .",
    "the optical scheme of a dfb laser and registering apparatus were practically the same as in @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . a @xmath84 mm ethanol solution of rhodamine 6 g was used as active medium . the vertically polarized second harmonic generation ( @xmath85 nm ; @xmath86 nm ; beam quality factor @xmath87 ) from a dpss sta01sh-500 nd : lsb microlaser ( standa ltd . , lithuania ) delivering @xmath88 ns ( fwhm ) pulses with an energy of @xmath89 @xmath75j and a repetition rate as high as @xmath90 hz was employed as a pump source .",
    "the dfb laser oscillator represented a right - angle isosceles k-8 glass prism hypotenuse side of which is in optical contact with a dye in a cell with nonparallel windows . in such a scheme , the @xmath91 nm pump beams are symmetrically coupled into the active medium through the side faces of the prism thereby resulting in the first - order dfb laser operation .",
    "laser oscillations occur at a wavelength @xmath92 given by @xmath93 where where @xmath94 is the refractive index of the dye solution at the lasing wavelength @xmath92 , @xmath95 is the refractive index of the prism material at the pump wavelength @xmath15 ; @xmath96 is the incident angle of the pump beam at the prism - dye solution interface ( it differs from the angle @xmath5 inside the solution ) . to obtain a pair of pump beams with s- and p - polarizations , respectively",
    ", the electric field vector of one of the two microlaser beams was turned by @xmath97 with the help of a half - wave plate .",
    "the intensity of s - polarized beam was approximately two times higher than that of p - polarized one .",
    "the maximum total pump beams energy falling onto the surface of the dye solution in a cell did not exceed @xmath98 @xmath75j .    to provide optimal pumping geometry , the output beam from a microlaser with an initial diameter of about @xmath99 cm and a full - angle divergence of @xmath100 mrad was collimated in the vertical plane by a cylindrical lens ( focus length @xmath101 cm ) , while the distance between the microlaser head and the dfb laser input window was set to @xmath102 cm . upon such conditions , the excited zone of the dye in a cell represented a narrow horizontal stripe with a @xmath103 to @xmath104 cm length and @xmath105 cm height , depending on the intersection angle @xmath106 of the pump beams .    during experiments , the pump input and the dfb laser output energies",
    "were measured simultaneously with calibrated fd-24k photodiodes and an adc-2om/10 - 2 two - channel analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) . to adjust the pump power in a continuous manner ,",
    "a rotatable half - wave plate in combination with a dielectric polarizer was employed .",
    "a fiber - coupled s3804 automated diffraction grating spectrograph ( spectral resolution up to @xmath107 nm ) and an it51 - 30 fabry - perot interferometer were used for coarse and fine spectral measurements , respectively .",
    "the transient behavior of the pump and dfb laser pulses was studied using an agat - sf3 ultrafast streak camera ( time resolution up to @xmath108 ps ) .",
    "both the interferograms and streak camera images were captured by means of a sdu - r205 charge - coupled device ( ccd ) usb - tv camera with subsequent computer acquisition and processing of the obtained data .",
    "under mentioned above pumping conditions , a dfb laser exhibited smooth wavelength tunability within @xmath109 nm upon a spectral linewidth of @xmath110 nm and an optical - to - optical energy conversion efficiency up to @xmath111 .",
    "dependence of the output characteristics of a dfb laser on the experimental pumping conditions was investigated in details at @xmath112 nm , which falls into the dye amplification band maximum . in this case , the length of the pumped region of active medium was @xmath113 cm .",
    "first of all , the influence of the pump pulse intensity on the temporal course of the dfb laser output was studied in details .",
    "it was found that , generally , when pumped well above threshold , the dfb laser produces a multi - spike emission .",
    "both an overall length and a number of spikes in the pulse train depend on the pumping level @xmath114 and tend to decrease with decreasing the @xmath114 value . at pumping levels",
    "not very far from threshold single ultrashort pulses of a few tens of picoseconds duration are generated .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] reveals streak camera traces of the dfb laser pulses registered at different pumping levels corresponding to the next pulse appearing in the laser output .",
    "notice that , unlike fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the zero position of the time scale is of an arbitrary character and does not reflects the real build - up dynamic of the dfb lasing .",
    "should also be noted that , due to relatively low streak camera scan rate ( @xmath115 ns / cm ) used during these measurements , both the individual pulses in the pulse trains and their durations are not fully resolved .",
    "it is seen from fig . [",
    "fig5](a ) that at a pumping level of @xmath116 a dfb laser produces a train of four pulses with an overall width of @xmath117 ps . when the pump power is lowered to @xmath118 [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] and @xmath119 [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) ] , the number of emitted pulses reduces to three and two , respectively , while the overall pulse train lengths shorten to @xmath120 ps . at pumping levels",
    "@xmath121 stable generation of single picosecond pulses was observed [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) ] .",
    "the single pulse duration was rather sensitive to the pumping level and progressively broadened with decreasing the @xmath114 value .",
    "the shortest pulses were obtained near threshold of the second pulse ( @xmath122 ) . in this case , their duration was measured to be about @xmath123 ps ( fwhm ) . notice that before performing above measurements streak camera was set to operate with a scan rate of @xmath124 ns / cm thus providing an approximately four - fold increase in the time resolution . under such conditions , the spectral linewidth of the dfb laser emission amounted to @xmath125 nm while its energy reached @xmath126 @xmath75j . based on these data ,",
    "the time - bandwidth product @xmath127 and peak power @xmath128 of a single pulse are estimated to be @xmath129 and @xmath130 kw , respectively .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath127 is the evidence of the transform - limited character of single picosecond pulses generated by a dfb dye laser .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the dependence of the dfb laser output energy @xmath131 on the pump energy @xmath132 measured for the range of pumping levels @xmath133 ( i.e. , close to that of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath131 gradually grows with increasing the pump intensity .",
    "along with this , at least three alterations in slope may be noticed corresponding to the inflection points in fig .",
    "the first one is observed around pump energy of @xmath134 @xmath75j representing the lasing threshold , while the second and third ones correspond to the @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xmath75j , respectively .",
    "based on the two latter values of pump energies , we find that the appropriate pumping levels @xmath114 are accordingly @xmath137 and @xmath138 . from streak camera measurements presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) and ( c ) follows that the specified pumping level of @xmath122 and @xmath119 are indicative of the second and third picosecond pulses appearing in the dfb laser output .",
    "the above features regarding the course of the input - output characteristic of a dfb laser operating not far from threshold seem to be of undoubted practical interest .",
    "indeed , based solely on the energy measurement , it becomes possible without using a high - cost streak camera to precisely determine the range of pump intensities within which single picosecond pulse generation is provided by a dfb dye laser .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed the theoretical model of dfb dye laser action by polarization modulation .",
    "this fundamentally simple model based on consideration of values averaged over excitation grating allows to describe lasing dynamics , energetic and polarization characteristics of such lasers .",
    "the mathematical basis of the model is the modified rate equations for the density of excited molecules and the concentration of laser photons .",
    "comparison of our calculation results with experimental data shows good qualitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "in particular , the model allows to describe the multi - spike lasing and approximately predict the threshold values for successive pulse generation .",
    "polarization characteristics of such dfb lasers will be studied in detail in a separate work .",
    "as far as we know , we have performed the first realistic description of lasing dynamics of dfb dye laser based on polarization modulation . however , to obtain not only qualitative , but also quantitative agreement between calculations and measurements , one needs an advanced theory . in future , we plan to develop a semiclassical treatment of such lasers which is expected to give closer fit to the experimental data .",
