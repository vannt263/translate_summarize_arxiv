    "the 10 currently known transiting extrasolar planets occupy a special place among the nearly 200 known exoplanets because their photometric transits yield unambiguous information on their masses and radii .",

    "these planets are of special interest , as accurate parameter determination as well as other types of follow - up are facilitated . for this reason ,",
    "a number of wide - field surveys , using small telescopes , are underway ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the instruments are spread in a two - station , longitude - distributed network , with four telescopes at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) in arizona , and two telescopes at the submillimeter array ( sma ) at hawaii .",
    "technical aspects of hatnet will be described in a forthcoming paper , but for instrumentation , observations , and data flow , see @xcite . here",
    "we report on the first detection by hatnet of a transiting extrasolar planet .",
    "this planet , which we hereafter label as hat - p-1b , orbits a 10th magnitude star , and thus is well - suited for follow - up with large ground - based and space telescopes .",
    "the existence of hat - p-1b  was first inferred from a 0.6% ( 6 mmag ) deep transit - like dip seen in the @xmath5-band light curve  of the stellar system ( aitken double star catalogue ; * ? ? ?",

    "the system appears as a single , elongated source in the hat images because this separation is less than the 14@xmath8  image resolution .",
    "initial follow - up spectroscopy at the flwo telescope showed the absence of radial velocity variations of either star at a level of 1 @xmath9  or larger , demonstrating that the source of the photometric dips could not be due to a common false positive , namely an m dwarf star transiting in front of one of the stars .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy at the subaru telescope using n2k project observing time @xcite , and later at the w.  m.  keck telescope revealed sinusoidal velocity variations of  with an amplitude of 60@xmath10 , thus suggesting the existence of a 0.5@xmath1  planet transiting that star . after excluding blend scenarios , the combination of the photometric and spectroscopic data leads to the conclusion that this object , hat - p-1b , is indeed a planet , and has a radius comparable to that of hd 209458b , and a somewhat lower mean density . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we discuss all of the above points in more detail .",

    "the observational error box of  from the sme analysis ( fig .  [ fig : isochrones ] ) overlaps with the zams for any z , and naturally , the star can not lie below the zams for the accepted abundance , so this constrains the possible solution from the lower bounds of @xmath17  and @xmath61 .",

    "* m.  holman , private communication ) points to a smaller planetary radius and normal density .",
    "similarly , the xo-1b discovery paper @xcite derives a larger radius than the value later refined by @xcite .    has a radius some 10 to 20 percent larger than expected , given its age , mass , and expected temperature including effects of irradiation .",
    "possible solutions include : ( a ) a fraction of a percent of the stellar flux irradiating could be transported to deep layers of order 100 bar , and thereby keep the planet s radius puffed up @xcite ; ( b ) there is a small eccentricity of its orbit , forced by the presence of a so - far undetected planetary companion and leading to internal tidal heating @xcite , and ( c ) hd 209458b might be in a cassini state  a dynamical state where its rotation axis lies close to the plane of its orbit @xcite , leading to large obliquity tides that cause heating at significant depth leading to the planet s large radius .",
    "a natural question about the first of these mechanisms is why all close - in `` hot jupiters '' are not similarly bloated by that mechanism .",
    "a problem with the last two mechanisms is that both are _ ad hoc _ ; they require unusual circumstances for which there is no independent evidence .    with the discovery of another planet , hat - p-1b , which has a radius similar to and probably even larger than , and an even smaller density , mechanisms requiring unusual circumstances seem less likely .",
    "moreover , for , explanation ( b ) appears ruled out because doppler data @xcite and transit timing variations data @xcite have excluded companion planets capable of enacting it .    in the case of hat - p-1b , it remains possible that the system has a second planet capable of forcing its eccentricity and leading to internal tidal heating .",
    "our current orbital solution ( ) suggests @xmath118 .",
    "if confirmed , such eccentricity would be a strong indication for the presence of a third body ( second planet ) , because otherwise tidal dissipation would have circularized hat - p-1b s orbit in @xmath119  myr .",
    "the dissipation factor , @xmath120 , is poorly known for `` hot jupiters '' , but is expected to lie between the values for jupiter and solar - like stars ( @xmath121 to @xmath122 ) . with forced orbital eccentricity , @xmath123 , hat - p-1b  will be subject to internal tidal heating due to an energy dissipation rate @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the gravitational constant , @xmath126 is the mass of the star , @xmath127 is the semimajor axis , @xmath128 is the mean motion , and @xmath120 is the specific dissipation factor . with @xmath129 ,",
    "the rate of energy dissipation in hat - p-1b  would be @xmath130 , corresponding to energy dissipation per unit jupiter mass of @xmath131 .",
    "this rate is almost identical to the dissipation rate per unit jupiter mass of @xmath132 required to achieve a 20% increase in @xmath106  for ( no core model ) and explain its anomalous low density @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that if the orbital eccentricity is confirmed , the anomalous @xmath106  and low density of hat - p-1b  could be easily explained by tidal heating . the perturbing second planet would be detectable by both transit timing variations and doppler velocities .",
    "for now , however , all that can be said is that bloated planets are not that unusual , and , since a second perturbing planet is lacking in hd 209458b s case , perhaps some other explanation should be sought that can explain such planets more generally .",
