    "one - dimensional models of stochastic processes attracted much attention last decade .",
    "being related to several natural phenomena like the interface growth @xcite , the traffic flow@xcite , and the self - organized criticality@xcite , they admit an exact calculation of  many physical quantities , which can not be obtained with mean - field approach . such models served as a testing ground for the description of many interesting effects specific for nonequilibrium systems like , boundary induced  phase transitions @xcite,@xcite , shock waves @xcite  and condensation transition @xcite .",
    "the most  prominent in the physical community one - dimensional stochastic model is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "the interest in this model was inspired by its bethe ansatz solution @xcite,@xcite , which became the first  direct exact calculation of the dynamical exponent of kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite . since then plenty of exact results",
    "were obtained in this direction using both the bethe ansatz schutzrev and the matrix product method @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the former is the possibility of consideration of time dependent quantities rather than only the stationary ones . among the results obtained for the asep with the help of the bethe ansatz",
    "there are the crossover scaling functions for the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite , the large deviation function of the kardar - parisi - zhang - type interface @xcite,@xcite , the time dependent correlation functions on the infinite schutz and the periodic lattices @xcite .",
    "though the bethe ansatz solvability  opens rich opportunities for obtaining exact results , it implies restrictive limitations for the dynamical rules , such that the range of the bethe ansatz solvable models is not too wide . besides the asep",
    ",  the examples of the particle hopping models , which admit the bethe ansatz solution , are the asymmetric diffusion models @xcite , generalized drop - push models @xcite , and the asymmetric avalanche process ( asap ) @xcite .",
    "most of the models of stochastic processes solved by the bethe ansatz are formulated in terms of continuous time dynamics or random sequential update , which allows one to use the analogy with the integrable quantum chains .",
    "the results for the  processes with discrete time parallel update are rare @xcite .",
    "on the other hand in conventional theory of quantum integrable systems the fundamental role is played by the two dimensional vertex models , all the quantum spin chains and continuous quantum models being their particular limiting cases @xcite . in the theory of one - dimensional stochastic processes",
    "the same role could be played by the models with discrete time parallel update , i.e. so called stochastic cellular automata @xcite .",
    "having plenty of real applications , the cellular automata give splendid opportunity for doing large scale numerical simulations .",
    "thus , finding the bethe ansatz solutions for discrete time models with fully parallel update would be of interest .",
    "the lack of such solutions owes probably to more complicated structure of the stationary state of models with the fully parallel update , which makes the application of the bethe ansatz more subtle .",
    "recently  the bethe ansatz was applied to solve the continuous time zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite with the nonuniform stationary state @xcite .",
    "the solution was based on the bethe ansatz weighted with the stationary weights of corresponding configurations .",
    "the simple structure of the stationary state  of the zrp allowed finding the one - parametric family of the hopping rates , which provides the bethe ansatz integrability of the model . in the present article we use the same trick to solve much more general model of  the zrp with fully parallel update , which is defined by two - parametric family of hopping probabilities .",
    "as particular limiting cases of the parameters the model includes q - boson asymmetric diffusion modelsw2 , which in turn includes the drop - push @xcite and phase model bik , and the asap @xcite .",
    "simple mapping allows one to consider also the asep - like model that obeys the exclusion rule . in general",
    "it includes the long range interaction between particles , which makes the hopping probabilities dependent on the length of queue of particles next to the hopping one . in the simplest case ,",
    "when the latter interaction is switched off , the model reduces to the nagel - schreckenberg traffic model @xcite with the maximal velocity @xmath7 . in the article",
    "we find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues  of the equation for the generating function of the distance travelled by particles and obtain the bethe equations for both asep and zrp cases .",
    "we analyze the solution of the bethe equations corresponding to the largest eigenvalue  of the equation for the generating function of the distance travelled by particles .",
    "the analysis shows that a particular limit of parameters of the model reveals the second order phase transition .",
    "when the density of particles reaches the critical value , the new phase emerges , which changes the dependence of the average flow of particles on the density of particles .",
    "the phase transition turns out to be intimately related to the intermittent - to - continuous flow transition in the asap , and the jamming transition in the traffic models .",
    "we analyze this transition in detail .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii we formulate the model and discuss the basic results of the article . in the section iii",
    "we give the bethe ansatz solution of the equation for the generating function of the moments of the distance travelled by particles . in the section",
    "iv we study the long time behavior of this equation and obtain its largest eigenvalue .",
    "the special form of the bethe equations in the particular case , which corresponds to the nagel - schreckenberg model with @xmath7 , allows one to proceed with the calculations for arbitrary size of the lattice and number of particles . in the other cases we obtain the results in the scaling limit . in the section",
    "v we discuss the particular limit of the model , which exhibits the phase transition . in the section",
    "vi we discuss the calculation of the stationary correlation functions with the partition function formalism .",
    "a short summary is given in the section vii .",
    "the system under consideration can be most naturally formulated in terms of the discrete time zrp .",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional periodic lattice consisting of @xmath8 sites with @xmath9 particles on it .",
    "every site can hold any number of particles .",
    "a particle from an occupied site jumps to the next site forward with probability @xmath10 , which depends only on the occupation number @xmath11 of a site of departure .",
    "the system evolves step by step in the discrete time @xmath12 , all sites being updated simultaneously at every step .",
    "thus , as a result of the update the configuration @xmath13 , defined by the set of occupation numbers@xmath14changes as follows @xmath15here the variable @xmath16 , taking values @xmath17 or @xmath18 ,  denotes the number of particles arriving at the site @xmath19 .  according to these dynamical rules ,",
    "all @xmath16-s associated to the same time step are independent random variables with the distribution , which depends on the occupation number of the site @xmath20@xmath21the probability @xmath22 for the system to be in a configuration @xmath13 at time step @xmath12 obeys the markov equation@xmath23where @xmath24 is the probability of the transition from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "this equation is known to have a unique stationary solution @xcite , which belongs to the class of the so called product measures , i.e. the probability of a configuration is given by the product of one - site factors @xmath27where the one - site factor @xmath28 is defined as follows@xmath29and @xmath30 is the normalization constant .",
    "the properties of this stationary measure have been intensively investigated particularly due to the possibility of condensation transition in such systems @xcite .",
    "the question we are going to address below is : which dynamics leading to such a stationary measure admits the exact solution ?",
    "a simple mapping allows one to convert zrp into asep . given a zrp configuration , we represent every site occupied with @xmath11 particles as a sequence of @xmath11 sites occupied each with one particle plus one empty site ahead ( see fig .",
    "[ asep - zrp ] ) .",
    "( 110,30)[cc ]    thus , we add @xmath9 extra sites to the lattice , so that its  size becomes @xmath31 obviously the exclusion constraint is imposed now .",
    "the evolution started with such a configuration is completely defined by the above zrp dynamics . specifically , any particle , which belongs to a cluster of @xmath11 particles and has empty site ahead ( i.e. the first particle of the cluster ) ,  jumps forward with the probability @xmath32 or stays with the probability @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we obtain the generalized asep with the asymmetric long range interaction , which we refer to as the asep associated to given zrp .",
    "note that the above zrp - asep relation applied on the periodic lattice establishes correspondence between the sequences of configurations rather than between the configurations themselves .",
    "this fact can be illustrated with a simple example .",
    "consider the following sequence of steps of the zrp evolution . at the first step a particle jumps from an occupied site @xmath19 to the next site @xmath34 , at the second from @xmath34 to @xmath35 and so on until a particle comes to the site @xmath19 from @xmath20 restoring the initial configuration .",
    "reconstruction of the corresponding sequence of the asep configurations implies that when a particle joins a cluster of particles from the behind , the front particle of the same cluster takes the next step , which leads to the shift of the cluster one step backward . as a result",
    "we finally come to the configuration translated as a whole one step backward with respect to the initial one . this difference does not allow the zrp and the asep to be considered as one model .",
    "there are , however , some quantities , which are not sensitive to translations , and therefore are identical for two models .",
    "for example the stationary measure of the associated asep is given by the expression ( [ p_st ] ) , though @xmath28 corresponds now to a cluster of @xmath11 particles with one empty site ahead .",
    "apparently , the probability of any configuration does not change under the translation of the configuration as a whole .",
    "below we consider the generating function of the total distance travelled by particles , @xmath36 , in the infinite time limit , @xmath37 , which is also the same for the zrp and the asep associated to it .",
    "the only thing we should keep in mind in such cases is that in zrp the numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the lattice size and the number of particles respectively , while in the associated asep @xmath8  is the number of holes , @xmath9 is the number of particles , and the size of the lattice is @xmath38 . of course , time- or spatially- dependent quantities in general require separate consideration for each model . in this article",
    "we first consider zrp dynamics and then point out the difference  of solution for the of associated asep .    in the end of the discussion of the zrp - asep correspondence",
    "we should mention that another version of the asep can be obtained from the above one by the particle - hole transformation .",
    "then the hopping probabilities will depend on the length of headway in front of the particle like for example the hopping rates in the bus route model @xcite .",
    "though the latter formulation seems more naturally related to the real traffic , we will use the former one to keep the direct connection with the zrp .",
    "of course the results for both versions can be easily related to each other .      to formulate basic result of the article we introduce the following generating function @xmath39where",
    "@xmath40 is the joint probability for the system to be in configuration @xmath13 at time @xmath12 , the total distance travelled by particles @xmath36 being equal to @xmath41 . by definition",
    "the generating function , @xmath42 , coincides with the probability @xmath43 of the configuration @xmath13 in the particular case @xmath44 .",
    "the function @xmath45 obeys the evolution equation similar to ( [ master1 ] ) @xmath46the term @xmath47 accounts the increase of the total distance @xmath36 , @xmath48 being the number of particles , which make a step during the transition from @xmath25 to @xmath13 .",
    "below we show that the eigenfunctions of this equation , satisfying the following eigenfunction problem@xmath49have the form of the bethe ansatz weighted with the weights of stationary configurations provided that the hopping probabilities has the following form@xmath50 _ { q},\\quad n=1,2,3,\\ldots , \\label{p(n)}\\]]where @xmath51 _ { q}$ ] are",
    "the so called q - numbers @xmath52 _ { q}=\\frac{1-q^{n}}{1-q}.   \\label{q - numbers}\\]]thus , as usual , the bethe ansatz to be applicable , the infinite in general set of toppling probabilities should be reduced to two parametric family , the parameters being @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "formally , there are no any further limitations on the parameters",
    ". however , once we want  @xmath32 to be probabilities , they should be less than or equal to one and nonnegative .",
    "it is obviously correct for any @xmath11 if @xmath53if @xmath54 , and an integer @xmath55 exists , such that @xmath56 _ { q}<p<1/\\left [ n^{\\ast } \\right ] _",
    "{ q}$ ] ,  we can still formulate the model with a finite number of particles @xmath57 . the only way to consider an arbitrary number of particles with @xmath54 is to consider the limit @xmath58 .",
    "particularly , if we put @xmath59 where @xmath60 is infinitesimally small , the model turns into the _",
    "_  _ _ continuous time version of zrp ( or associated asep ) known also as q - boson asymmetric diffusion model @xcite . in this model the poisson rate @xmath61 of the hopping of a particle from a site is given by @xmath62_{q}$ ] , @xmath1 taking on values in the range@xmath63 .",
    "such continuous time limit seems to be the only possibility for @xmath1 to exceed @xmath17 .",
    "this model was studied  in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the case @xmath64 @xmath65 also implies @xmath66 for some finite @xmath67 and thus do not allow consideration of arbitrary @xmath9 , which is of practical interest .",
    "thus , below we concentrate on the domain ( [ q<1 ] ) .",
    "the other particular limits of the model under consideration , which reproduce the models studied before are as follows :     _ the nagel - schreckenberg traffic model with _",
    "@xmath7 corresponds to the asep with @xmath3 , when the probabilities @xmath68 are independent of @xmath11 , @xmath69 .",
    "this case will be considered separately because , due to the special factorized form of the bethe equations , it can be treated for arbitrary finite @xmath8 and @xmath9 .     _ the asymmetric avalanche process",
    "_ corresponds to the limit@xmath70originally the asap has been formulated as follows . in a stable state , @xmath9 particles are located on a ring of @xmath8 sites , each site being occupied at most by one particle . at any moment of continuous time",
    "each particle can jump one step forward with poisson rate @xmath17 .",
    "if a site @xmath19 contains more than one particle @xmath71 , it becomes unstable , and must relax immediately by spilling forward either @xmath11 particles with probability @xmath72 or @xmath73 particles with probability @xmath74 .",
    "the relaxation stops when all sites become stable again with @xmath75 for any @xmath19 .",
    "the period of subsequent relaxation events is called avalanche .",
    "the avalanche is implied to be infinitely fast with respect to the continuous time .",
    "the toppling probabilities , which ensure the exact solvability of the model can also be written in terms of @xmath76numbers@xmath77_{q},\\quad -1<q\\leq 0 ,   \\label{mu_n}\\]]below we show that the asap  can be obtained as the continuous time limit of the zrp observed from the moving reference frame , one step of the discrete time @xmath12 being associated with the  infinitesimal time interval @xmath78 .",
    "let us now turn to the physical results we can extract from the bethe ansatz solution . to this end , we note that the large time behavior of the generating function of the distance travelled by particles @xmath79 is defined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath80 of the equation ( [ eigenproblem ] ) @xmath81respectively , the logarithm of the largest eigenvalue @xmath82 is the generating function of the cumulants of @xmath36 in the infinite time limit @xmath83here the angle brackets denote the cumulants rather than moments of the particle current distribution , which is emphasized with the subscript @xmath84 .",
    "below we give the results for @xmath85 given in terms of two parameters , one of which is @xmath1 introduced above , and the other is @xmath86 defined as follows @xmath87which captures all the dependence on the above @xmath0 .    *",

    ".  an explicit form of these constants will be derived in the following sections .",
    "the results in the limit @xmath106 are of special interest .",
    "below we show that in this limit the model exhibits a phase transition , which is closely related to the intermittent - continuous flow transition in the asap and the jamming transition in traffic models . when the density of particles is less than critical density@xmath107almost all particles synchronously jump forward with rare exceptions , which happen with probability of order of @xmath108 .",
    "thus the average flow of particles is equal to the density of particles with small correction of order of @xmath108.@xmath109however , when the density approaches @xmath110 the average flow @xmath111 stops growing.@xmath112it turns out that a fraction of particles gets stuck at a small fraction of sites instead of being involved into the particle flow . as a result",
    "the density of the particles involved into the flow is kept equal to @xmath110 .",
    "this phenomenon can be treated as a phase separation .",
    "the new phase consisting of immobile particles emerges at the critical point .",
    "any increase of the density above the critical point leads to the growth of this phase , while the density of mobile particles remains unchanged . in  terms of the associated asep or the traffic models",
    "one can describe the situation as an emergence of  a small number of traffic jams with average length diverging , when @xmath108 decreases .",
    "such behaviour leads to singularities in the constants @xmath104 , eq.([ln lamda_0 ] ) , which define the large deviations of the particle current from the average .",
    "below we analyze them in detail .",
    "we also study the stationary measure of the model with the canonical partition function formalism .",
    "the calculation of the stationary correlation functions are discussed .",
    "we observe the relations between the bethe ansatz solution in the thermodynamic limit and the thermodynamic properties of the stationary state .",
    "we make a conjecture that the relations found between the parameters characterizing the large deviations of the particle current and the parameters of the stationary state hold for the general zrp belonging to the kpz universality class .",
    "finally we analyze the change of the behaviour of the occupation number distribution at the critical point in the limit @xmath113 .",
    "in addition the evaluation of @xmath30 reveals interesting relation of the model with the theory of @xmath1-series @xcite , being based on the use of the most famous relation of this theory , @xmath1-binomial theorem .",
    "let us consider the equation for the generating function @xmath114 for  the zrp , @xmath115where we imply periodic boundary conditions @xmath116 .",
    "the summation is taken over all possible values of @xmath117 , which are the numbers of particles arriving at sites @xmath118 @xmath8 @xmath119respectively .",
    "they take on the values of either @xmath18 or @xmath17 if @xmath120 and of only @xmath18 otherwise .    before using the bethe ansatz for the solution of this equation we should make the following remark .",
    "most of the models studied by the coordinate bethe ansatz have a common property .",
    "that is , a system evolves to the stationary state , where all the particle configurations occur with the same probability .",
    "this property can be easily understood from the structure of the bethe eigenfunction .",
    "indeed , the stationary state is given by the groundstate of the evolution operator , which is the eigenfunction with zero eigenvalue and momentum .",
    "such bethe function does not depend on particle configuration at all and results in the equiprobable ensemble .",
    "apparently the zrp under consideration is not the case like this . the way how to reduce the problem to the one with uniform groundstate",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to look for the solution in the form,@xmath121here @xmath122 is the stationary probability defined in ( p_st ) .",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath123 satisfy the following equation@xmath124this form of the equation has two important advantages .",
    "the first is that the coefficient before @xmath125 under the sum is the product of one site factors .",
    "the second is that if we formally define @xmath126 the values of @xmath16-s will take on values of @xmath18 and @xmath17 with no respect to the value of @xmath127 . to proceed",
    "further we should go to a different way of representation of system configurations .",
    "let us define the configuration by the coordinates of particles written in non - decreasing order@xmath128obviously this is nothing but the change of notations , both representations being completely equivalent .",
    "below we refer to them as to the occupation number representation and the coordinate representation respectively .",
    "we are going to show that the eigenfunctions of the equation ( [ master2 ] ) written in the coordinate representation can be found in form of the bethe ansatz .",
    "we first consider the cases @xmath129 and @xmath130 subsequently generalizing them for an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "the eigenfunction problem for the master equation for one particle is simply the one for the asymmetric random walk in discrete time.@xmath131the eigenfunction is to be looked for in the form@xmath132where @xmath133 is some complex number . substituting ( [ ansatz , m=1 ] ) to ( master , m=1 ) we obtain the expression of the eigenvalue @xmath134the periodic boundary conditions @xmath135imply the limitations on the parameter @xmath133@xmath136      in this case we consider two particles with coordinates @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath139 the equation is that for the asymmetric random walk for two non - interacting particles @xmath140while the case @xmath141 should be treated separately.@xmath142the general strategy of the bethe ansatz solution is as follows .",
    "we want to limit ourselves by the only functional form of the equation for @xmath143 of the form ( [ master , m=2 ] ) .",
    "to get rid of the additional constraints imposed by interaction , like that in ( [ master , m=2,x1=x2 ] ) , we recall that the function @xmath144 , is defined in the domain@xmath145 .",
    "if we formally set @xmath141 in the equation ( [ master , m=2 ] ) , one of the terms in r.h.s . , @xmath146 , will be outside of this domain .",
    "we could redefine it in such a way , that the eq.(master , m=2,x1=x2 ) would be satisfied .",

    "the first one is @xmath155and the second is obtained by the change @xmath156 .      for an arbitrary number of particles we will follow the same strategy .",
    "we consider the equation for noninteracting particles , which jump forward with the probability @xmath0 @xmath157here , all the numbers @xmath16-s run over values @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "our aim is to redefine the terms beyond the physical domain , ( [ domain ] ) , in terms of ones within this domain in order to satisfy the equation with zrp interaction ( [ master2 ] ) written in the coordinate representation .",
    "this redefinition results in many constraints on the terms @xmath158 .",

    "therefore , the processes corresponding to a particle arriving at a site can be considered for each site separately .",

    "the last step we need to do is to impose the periodic boundary conditions.@xmath193they are equivalent to the following relations for the amplitudes.@xmath194consistency of this relation with eq.([constraint ] ) results in the system of @xmath9 algebraic bethe equations,@xmath195we should emphasize that the crucial step for the bethe ansatz solvability is the proof that all many - particle interactions can be reduced to the two - particle constraint , eq.([constraint ] ) .",
    "existence of any other constraints on the eigenfunctions would result in new equations for parameters @xmath196 which would make the resulting system of algebraic equations overdetermined .",
    "as it was noted above , the bethe ansatz solution for the asep is quite similar to that for the zrp and can be done in parallel .",
    "indeed , if we define the function @xmath123 in the same way as it was defined for zrp , the equations for it can be obtained from those for zrp by the variable change @xmath197which corresponds to the zrp - asep transformation described above .",
    "thus , the free equation does not change its form , with the only difference that the physical domain for the asep implies every site to be occupied at most by one particle .",
    "@xmath198therefore the bethe ansatz ( [ bethe ansatz ] ) substituted to the free equation results in the same form of the eigenvalue ( [ lambda(gamma ) ] ) .",
    "the two particle constraint , which is used now to redefine the  nonphysical terms containing the pair @xmath199 , have the following form @xmath200if we insert here the bethe ansatz ( [ bethe ansatz ] ) , we obtain the following relation for the amplitudes@xmath201all the other arguments , which extend the problem to the general @xmath202particle , case are completely the same as those for the zrp . finally , the periodic boundary conditions lead to the bethe equations@xmath203here we recall that the lattice size is equal now to @xmath93 rather than @xmath8 . this equations can be rewritten in the following form@xmath204where we introduce the notation @xmath205this term is the only difference between the bethe equations for the zrp and the asep . taking a product of all the equations we obtain , @xmath206the term @xmath207 has a very simple physical meaning .",

    "the largest eigenvalue of the markov equation is equal to 1 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstate is the stationary state ( [ p_st ] ) .",
    "it then follows from the definition , that @xmath214 in this limit becomes constant , i.e. it is the same for all configurations , and the corresponding solution of the bethe equations is @xmath215 or @xmath216 .",
    "if @xmath89 deviates from @xmath18 the analyticity and no - crossing of the eigenvalue is guaranteed by perron - frobenius theorem . by continuity",
    "we also conclude that the parameter @xmath217 defined above is equal to 1 for arbitrary @xmath89 , @xmath218      in the case @xmath3 , the form of eq.([baey ] ) allows one to obtain the largest eigenvalue for arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if we define the parameter , @xmath219the solution of the bethe equations , which corresponds to the largest eigenvalue , will be given by @xmath9 roots of the polynomial@xmath220which approach zero when @xmath90 tends to zero .",
    "then the sum of a function @xmath221 analytic in some vicinity of zero over the bethe roots , can be calculated as the following integral over the contour closed around the roots : @xmath222particularly , after the integration by parts the expression for @xmath223 has the following form:@xmath224at the same time the expression for @xmath89 as a function of @xmath90 can be obtained by taking a logarithm of eq.([prod z=1])@xmath225to evaluate it we make a series expansion of the logarithms in powers of @xmath90 and integrate the resulting series term by term .",

    "for instance , the exact value of the average flow of particles is of the following form:@xmath227 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath228  the average velocity of particles @xmath229  saturates to the formula obtained in @xcite , @xmath230it is straightforward to obtain the other cumulants up to any arbitrary order .",
    "it is not difficult also to study the asymptotic behavior of the series in the large @xmath8  limit . to this end",
    "one can evaluate the saddle point asymptotics of the integrals instead of their exact values or use the asymptotic formulas for the binomial coefficients and the hypergeometric functions .",
    "the thermodynamic limit however allows significant simplification already at the stage of writing of the bethe equations , which makes possible to consider more general case of arbitrary value of @xmath1 .      the technique used in this section was first developed to study the non - factorizable bethe equations for the partially asep @xcite and then applied to the study of the asap @xcite .",
    "since the analysis is quite similar , we outline only the main points of the solution .",
    "technical details can be found in the original papers .",
    "the scheme consists of the following steps .",

    "@xmath236the r.h.s .",
    "comes from the choice of branches of the logarithm , which specifies particular solution corresponding to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "the choice coincides with that appeared in the solution of the asymmetric six - vertex model at the conical point @xcite and later of the asep kim .",
    "it can be also justified by considering the limit @xmath3 , where the locus of the roots can be found explicitly .",
    "the point @xmath237 corresponding to the starting point of roots counting can be any point of the contour .",
    "the integral equation should be solved for a particular form of the contour , which is not known _ a priory _ , and being first assumed should be self - consistently checked after the solution has been obtained . in practice , however , an analytic solution is possible in the very limited number of cases .",
    "fortunately , we can proceed by analogy with the solution  of the asymmetric six - vertex model at the conical point @xcite choosing the contour closed around zero .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ int_eq ] ) yields the density@xmath238where the function @xmath239 is defined as follows@xmath240this case corresponds to @xmath241 and hence @xmath242 . since @xmath243 is analytic in the ring @xmath244 ,",
    "the integration of it along any contour closed in this ring does not depend on its form .",
    "therefore , to fix the form of the contour additional constraints are necessary .",
    "such a constraint was found by bukman and shore @xcite as follows .",
    "they assumed that when @xmath89 deviates from zero , the contour becomes discontinuous at some point @xmath245 .",
    "it is possible then to solve eq.([int_eq ] ) perturbatively considering the length of the gap of the contour as a small parameter .",
    "it turns out that the solution exists only if the break point @xmath245 satisfies the equation @xmath246which fixes the location of @xmath245 as well as the location of all the contour @xmath232 in the limit @xmath247 .",
    "this method however allows a calculation of only the first derivative of @xmath248 at @xmath241 in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. the leading asymptotics of the average flow of particles .",
    "to study the behaviour of @xmath249 for nonzero values of @xmath89 , a calculation of the finite size corrections to the above expression of @xmath243 is necessary . to this end , we use the method developed in @xcite .",

    "finally the point @xmath245 enters into all the results through the coefficients @xmath279 and @xmath280 . the final expression for @xmath281 obtained in the scaling limit",
    "@xmath282  has the form ( [ ln lamda_0]-[x(c ) ] ) , which was obtained earlier  for the asep and the asap and claimed to be universal for the kpz universality class @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath104 specific for the model under consideration , @xmath283are expressed through the derivatives of the function @xmath239 , ( eq.([g(x ) ] ) ) . as it follows from the explicit form of eq.([x_c ] ) , the unphysical parameter @xmath245 is related to the density @xmath105 by the equation , @xmath284 in sec .",
    "vi we show that relations ( [ phi],[rho vs xc ] ) can be obtained from the partition function formalism for the stationary state without going into the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "the parameter @xmath245 then turns out to be related to the fugacity of a particle in the infinite system .",
    "thus , this result follows from the properties of the stationary state only , rather than from the solution of the dynamical problem .",
    "in general the partition function formalism allows the calculation of any stationary spatial correlations .",
    "the bethe ansatz , however , allows one to probe into really dynamical characteristics , i.e. those , which are related to unequal time correlation functions , such as higher cumulants of the distance travelled by particles .",
    "they can be expressed through the constants  @xmath285 from eqs.([k1],[k2 ] ) by taking derivatives of the formula ( [ lambda , q=0 ] ) , which yields the following behavior , specific for the kpz universality class,@xmath286    studying the dependence of the results on the physical parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 one should solve the equation ( [ rho vs xc ] ) to find the behavior of  @xmath287 . even without the explicit solution we can say that for generic values of @xmath0 and @xmath1  the point @xmath245 is located at the positive part of the real axis in the segment @xmath288 , where the function @xmath289 increases monotonously from @xmath18 to infinity .",
    "apparently the constants @xmath104 do not have any singularities for @xmath245 varying in this region and , thus , no abrupt change of the behavior is expected .",
    "particularly , the results obtained reproduce the corresponding results for several models studied before . for example , in the continuous time limit , @xmath290 , keeping only the first order in @xmath0 we obtain the corresponding constants for @xmath76boson asymmetric diffusion model sw,@xcite , which itself contains the drop push model @xcite and phase model @xcite as particular cases , and can be related also to the totally asep .",
    "the only interesting exception is the limiting case @xmath113 , which turns out to exhibit a kind of phase transition phenomena .",
    "let us first consider qualitatively what happens in the limit @xmath291 in the domain @xmath292 in this limit a particle from a single particle ( sp ) site , i.e. from a site occupied by one particle only , almost definitely takes a step forward at every time step . at the same time , one particle from a many particle ( mp ) site , i.e. from a site occupied by more than one particle , takes a step with the probability in general less than one . when the jumps of particles fromsp sites are purely deterministic , i.e. the equality @xmath293 holds exactly , the zrp dynamics becomes `` frozen '' as soon as the system arrives at any configuration consisting of sp sites only . by `` frozen '' we mean that at every time step particles from all sites synchronously jump one step forward .",
    "thus , the structure of the configuration remains unchanged up to a uniform translation .",
    "therefore such configurations play the role of absorbing states when @xmath293 .",
    "when @xmath0 is less than @xmath17 by a small value @xmath294 , the system can go from one absorbing state to another with the probability of order of @xmath294 .",
    "this happens if at least one particle decides not to jump .",
    "it is easy to see that the limit under consideration is directly related to the asap .",
    "let us look at the system from the comoving reference frame , which moves a step forward at every time step . in this frame particles from the sp sites either",
    "stay with the probability @xmath295 or take a step backward with the probability @xmath294 . at the same time the mp sites play a role of  columns ( or avalanches ) of particles moving backward .",
    "individual history of every such a column develops according to the following rule . if @xmath296 particles occupy a site , either all @xmath11 particles jump to the next site backward with probability @xmath297 or @xmath298 particles jump and one stays with probability @xmath299 .",
    "one can see that the definition of probabilities @xmath72 coincides with those for the asap , eq.([mu_n ] ) , in the leading order in @xmath294 .",
    "if we associate one step of the discrete time @xmath12 with the continuous time interval @xmath300 , neglect the terms smaller than @xmath294  in the master equation and take the limit @xmath301 , we come to the continuous time master equation for the asap @xcite . note , that in the definition of the asap at most one avalanche is allowed to exist at a time . in principle , the discrete time dynamics allows for more than one simultaneous mp sites .",
    "however , the probability of formation of two or more of them for a finite number of steps is of order of @xmath302 and , as such , corresponding processes vanish when the limit @xmath303 is taken .",
    "as shown in @xcite the asap exhibits the transition from the intermittent to continuous flow regime . in this transition the average avalanche size ( the number of particle jumps in an avalanche )",
    "diverges in the thermodynamic limit when the density of particles approaches the critical point from below . to explain what this behaviour means in terms of the discrete time model under consideration",
    ", we note that the average avalanche size is roughly equal to the average number of particles occupying an mp site times the average number of steps , which an mp site persists for .",
    "let us consider a configuration with one mp site on the lattice . in average , the flow of particles into the mp site is equal to the density of mobile ( solitary ) particles .",
    "the flow out of the mp site with @xmath11 particles is @xmath304 , which saturates exponentially rapidly to the limiting value @xmath305 when @xmath11 grows .",
    "therefore , if @xmath306 , the outflow exceeds the inflow and the mp site tends to decay for a few steps . as a result",
    "the average occupation number and the life time of an mp site below the critical density are finite . on the contrary , if @xmath307 , the outflow is less than inflow and the dynamics favours the growth of the mp sites .",
    "on the finite lattice the mp site grows at the expense of the density of solitary particles until it absorbs enough particles to equalize inflow and outflow .",
    "this happens when the mp site contains @xmath308 particles .",
    "any deviation from this number destroys the balance between the inflow and outflow and the system tends to restore this value again . as a consequence the life time of such an mp site grows exponentially with the system size @xcite .",
    "of course the existence of only one mp site on the lattice is specific for the continuous time asap , where the probability of appearance of two mp sites simultaneously is neglible . in the discrete time case",
    "a possibility to have many mp sites at the lattice should be considered as well . however",
    ", if the characteristic occupation number of mp sites is such a large that the outflow from mp sites can be roughly replaced by @xmath309 , the above claim based on the balance between inflow and outflow remains valid : the total number of particles in all mp sites is equal to @xmath308 . as a result ,",
    "the particle current growing linearly with the density below the critical point , stops growing at @xmath110 due to appearance of mp sites , the occupation numbers of which grow instead .",
    "of course these arguments describe the limiting situation @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath310 is finite , the transition is smoothened . as shown in fig.(phiplot ) , the flow - density plot , obtained by substituting the result of numerical solution of eq.([rho vs xc ] ) to eq.([phi ] ) , approaches the form of broken line consisting of two straight segments : @xmath311 for @xmath312 @xmath110 and @xmath313 for @xmath314 @xmath110 .",
    "( 110,45)[cc ]    of course the above qualitative arguments being far from rigorous can only serve as an illustration .",
    "a specific distribution of the occupation numbers of mp sites can be obtained with the help of the canonical partition function formalism , which is described in details in the next section . in present section",
    "we analyse the behaviour of generating function @xmath315 of the cumulants of the integrated particle current @xmath36 that can be extracted form the solution of the bethe ansatz equations discussed above .    to this end",
    ", we note that the universal scaling form ( [ ln lamda_0]-x(c ) ) of @xmath316 holds in all the phase space , provided that the parameters @xmath104 are finite .",

    "once the value of @xmath245 is obtained from this solution , it is to be directly substituted to the formulas ( [ phi]-[k2 ] ) to obtain @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath323 the function @xmath324 can be summed up to the following simple form@xmath325such that eq.([rho vs xc ] ) @xmath119can be easily solved @xmath326then eqs.([phi]-[k2 ] ) yield : @xmath327 @xmath105 and @xmath328 , i.e. @xmath329 .",
