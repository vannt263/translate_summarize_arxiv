    "for example , only tentative reverberation results exist for mgii  @xcite , so the use of mgii  as a virial mass indicator is based only on its similar ionization potential and line width compared to h@xmath0  .",

    "here , we explore this apparent contradiction  why would rm - based iv civ  masses behave as expected but se masses do not ? in  [ s_semassassumptions ] we first review the fundamental assumptions that make estimating a se mass possible . in  [ s_rmmnrms ] we investigate properties of the iv civ  profile in the rm sample , identifying a source of bias related to the iv civ  line profile . in ",
    "[ s : shapebias ] we quantify this bias and empirically fit a correction to iv civ  masses that significantly reduces the scatter between iv civ  and h@xmath0  se masses .",
    "finally , in   [ s_discussion ] and [ s_conclusion ] we put our results in context to other studies , suggest a physical interpretation to explain our observations in terms of an orientation - dependent outflow , and summarize our findings .",
    "we start by reviewing the assumptions made to estimate a se bh mass .",
    "these assumptions are based on the different means with which the physical parameters required to measure a black hole mass ( blr radius and velocity ) are inferred in indirect ( se ) and direct ( rm ) methods .",
    "se masses rely on the continuum luminosity as a proxy for the blr radius , and this is susceptible to two sources of uncertainty that do not affect direct rm measurements of the blr radius : variability and host galaxy contamination .",
    "first , since rm measures the blr radius directly from the delay between the continuum emission and the reprocessed line emission , an rm mass is not directly dependent on the luminosity .",
    "instead , the measured blr radius and velocity ( and associated uncertainties ) are physically connected to the intrinsic agn luminosity through photoionization and its effects on blr emission properties ( e.g. , the locally optimally - emitting cloud model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result",
    ", rm will always give the same mass independent of the intrinsic variability ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the delay that makes rm experiments possible means that the photons responsible for the luminosity measured in a se spectrum are not the same as those responsible for producing the line emission whose width is measured in the same spectrum .",
    "therefore , _ the reliability of se masses depends on the assumption that the difference between the observed se luminosity and that responsible for triggering the observed line emission is negligible , or at least small .",
    "_ fortunately , the variability amplitude of agns is relatively small , @xmath17% , on reverberation time scales  the light - crossing time of the blr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since @xmath18 , the uncertainty in the luminosity due",
    "to variability is not a dominant source of uncertainty in se masses and is largely accounted for in the error budget through the uncertainties in the calibration of the @xmath8 relationship itself ( see * ? ? ?",
    "second , only the agn luminosity is correlated with the radius of the blr , since photoionization of the blr gas from the agn continuum photons is what drives the @xmath8 relationship .",
    "therefore , se masses will be overestimated if the observed se luminosity is not corrected for host galaxy starlight contamination .",
    "this contamination has been removed from rm data sets used to calibrate the @xmath8 relationship @xcite , but the rm masses themselves are independent of this contamination .",
    "next , because velocity is as important a parameter as the luminosity in determining se bh masses @xcite and @xmath19 , we must consider differences in the blr velocity field characterizations of the se and rm methods .",
    "rm masses are largely based on line widths measured from the rms spectrum ( i.e. , the spectrum formed from the rms flux deviations about the mean spectrum , based on all spectra obtained during a single reverberation mapping campaign ) , so that only the kinematics of the gas reverberating in response to the continuum photons contribute to the mass determination .",
    "the se line profile is not necessarily equivalent to the rms profile because there can be non - variable emission components present .",
    "so , _ the reliability of se masses also depends on the fundamental assumption that the se line - width is an accurate proxy for the rms blr velocity field_. comparisons of mean and rms h@xmath0  emission - line profiles show that even after removing the contamination from narrow line region ( nlr ) emission , the se profile is not identical to the rms profile  not all the h@xmath0  broad line - emitting gas is reverberating , particularly in the high - velocity wings .",
    "this results , on average , in narrower rms spectrum profiles than mean spectrum profiles . for h@xmath0",
    ", these differences are not significant enough to strongly bias the se mass estimates once the differences are taken into account statistically by the calibration of the scale factor , @xmath20 , for se masses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the many studies comparing se h@xmath0  masses to rm masses reinforces the reliability of these masses , but no similar investigation exists for the other emission lines used for se masses .",
    "the implication of ( 1 ) the large scatter between iv civ  and h@xmath0  se masses and ( 2 ) the consistency of iv civ  and h@xmath0  rm masses strongly suggests that the problem lies in the assumption that the iv civ  mean and rms line widths are similar .    to examine this , we collected mean and rms line width characterizations from rm experiments of both h@xmath0  and iv civ .",
    "we take the h@xmath0  fwhm and line dispersion , @xmath21 ( the second moment of the line profile ) , measurements from table 1 of @xcite , which have all been measured homogeneously using the methods described by @xcite .",
    "such a resource is not available for the iv civ  rm data sets , so we acquired the original mean and rms spectra from all available iv civ  rm experiments @xcite . from these mean and rms spectra , we fit and subtracted a linearly interpolated continuum between restframe continuum regions near 1450  ( except for the ngc 7469 rms spectrum , which was fit near 1500 , where the continuum appeared lower ) and 1700 .",
    "we then measured the iv civ  line widths directly ( i.e. , no functional forms were fit ) , except for the case of the rms spectrum of ngc 4395 , which was too noisy to measure directly . in this case , a sixth order gauss - hermite polynomial was fit to the data , and the width was measured from the fit .",
    "we employ the same line width measurement techniques as those utilized for h@xmath0  in order to have a homogeneous comparison . these new iv",

    "these differences are larger for the fwhm than for the line dispersion , and they are the largest and least uniform for the fwhm characterization of the iv civline .",
    "we investigate this incompatibility further by parameterizing the shape of the line profile in terms of the ratio @xmath23 .",
    "profiles with lower values of @xmath24 have ` peaky ' profiles with larger kurtosis , while those with higher values of @xmath24 have ` boxy ' profiles with smaller kurtosis .",
    "a gaussian profile has @xmath25 and a kurtosis of three .",
    "figure [ fig : shaperesidvsshape ] shows the ratio between the line shapes determined from the mean and rms spectra , @xmath26 , for both h@xmath0  and iv civ .",
    "the shapes of the mean and rms h@xmath0  line profiles are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "there may be a weak effect associated with narrow line seyfert 1 s ( open triangles ) , where it is difficult to accurately remove the contribution from the narrow - line component . for iv civ",
    ", however , the shapes of the mean and rms line profiles tend to be very different .",
    "the consistency in the mean and rms h@xmath0  line shape allows the simple offset in h@xmath0  widths seen in figure [ fig : widthmnvsrms ] to be easily compensated for in the standard recalibration of the rm bh masses for se data .",
    "no such calibration would work for iv civ  without introducing extra scatter in the se mass estimates compared to rm mass estimates .",
    "the differences between the se and rms iv civ  profile can also be seen through visual inspection of the mean and rms spectra observed in iv civreverberation mapping campaigns .",

    "this was also already demonstrated in figure [ fig : shaperesidvsshape ] , but we see in figure [ fig : civmnrms ] that the mean spectrum has an additional , low - velocity component absent from the rms spectrum for all objects but fairall 9 . in the case of fairall 9 , the rms signal is weak and the strength of the narrow core component in the rms spectrum is within the level of the flux uncertainties of the iue campaign data , which makes it difficult to interpret the shape differences ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in general",
    ", it appears that the se or mean iv civ  profile is made up of two components : a non - variable , largely core , component plus a variable component , the velocity profile of which can be isolated in the rms spectrum .",

    "the existence of two components in the se iv civ  profiles , only one of which is variable , has significant implications for the determinations of se iv civ  bh masses , both for individual estimates but also for calibrating the iv civ  mass scale itself .",
    "the contribution of the non - variable component creates a bias to the relevant ( i.e. , reverberating ) blr velocity field .",
    "this is particularly true when using the fwhm to characterize the line width .",
    "furthermore , the strength and profile of the non - variable component is not uniform object - to - object , so a simple change in the scale factor , @xmath20 , or subtraction of a constant , narrow velocity component will not work .",

    "this includes fitting sixth order gauss - hermite polynomials to the iv civ  profiles because of the typically poor data quality of this sample ( average s / n per pixel in the continuum near restframe 1700  is only 5.4 ) .",
    "interestingly , in several cases , our measurement for the fwhm of the iv civ  line in the n07 sample differs significantly from the values presented by n07 , as shown in figure [ fig : usvnetzerfwhm ] .",

    "an initial concern when correlating the line shape , which is determined from the iv civ  fwhm , with the bh mass residuals , which are also a function of the iv civ  fwhm , is that the correlation is a consequence of this redundant dependence , effectively plotting fwhm vs.  fwhm . to test this possibility",

    "the h@xmath0  se bh mass is still determined using the fwhm .",
    "now both axes depend on @xmath34 in the same way they depend on fwhm@xmath35 in the top panel .",
    "if the correlation in the top panel was due only to a redundant dependence on line width in both coordinate axes , we would expect to see a correlation of similar strength in the bottom panel , but we find no correlation , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , a partial correlation test between the quantities correlated in the top panel , with fwhm@xmath35 as a nuisance variable , results in a partial correlation coefficient , @xmath38 , which is nearly equal to that from the equivalent test for the bottom panel , with @xmath34 as the nuisance parameter , i.e. , @xmath39 , yet again , we do nt see a correlation of the @xmath34-based masses with @xmath33 .",
    "this not only confirms that the strong correlation of fwhm - based masses with shape is real ( i.e. , not due to a redundant dependence of bh mass and shape on line width ) , but also that iv civ  masses based on @xmath21 more reliably reproduce , in general , the h@xmath0  mass estimates .",
    "this latter point is not altogether surprising , since @xmath21 depends less on the structure of the core of the line profile , where the non - variable iv civ  emission component most strongly affects the shape .",

    "we can fit the correlation of the mass differences with shape to derive a corrected fwhm - based iv civ  se mass equation of the form    @xmath40    where the uncertainties in the slope and the intercept are given in table [ tab_fits ] .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : origacorrmassresid ] shows the original fwhm - based iv civ - to - h@xmath0  mass residuals as a function of h@xmath0  se bh mass .",

    "there is no longer a mean offset and the scatter is now only 0.26 dex .",
    "we have excluded the absorbed n07 targets ( gray stars ) from the fit and latter scatter determination because the iv civ  mass of these objects is biased by factors other than the intrinsic iv civ  line shape ( e.g. , absorption ; see also denney et al .  in prep . ) .",

    "many of these are the previously discussed n07 objects .",
    "the largest a11 sample outlier is q0142@xmath42100 , but this object was classified as a group ii object by a11 , due to an unreliable h@xmath0  line width , so the problem may have nothing to do with iv civ .",
    "the two largest vp06 outliers ( one above and one below the 1:1 relation ) are the two radio loud agns in the rm sample , 3c120 and 3c390.3 .",
    "this may simply be a coincidence or may indicate that radio loud agns follow a different iv civ  shape relation than radio quiet agns .",
    "for example , @xcite found very distinct differences between the iv civ  properties of the radio - loud and radio - quiet populations .",
    "the fwhm is the most widely - used line - width characterization in the literature , and it has the advantages of being easy to measure and relatively insensitive to blending in the line wings . on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of @xmath21 are robust for a wide range of line profiles and have been found to be a less biased line characterization in some cases .",
    "the problems with measuring @xmath21 include difficulties in accurately defining the line wings , particularly in low @xmath43 spectra , and in the presence of other blended emission - line features . despite these concerns , figures [ fig : widthmnvsrms ] and [ fig : massresidvshape ] , respectively , show that characterizing the iv civ  width with @xmath21 leads to ( 1 ) velocities that are more consistent with the 1:1 relation between the mean and rms spectrum in the reverberation - mapped sample , and ( 2 ) masses that show less bias with the line shape , @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , when we calculate the iv civ  mass using @xmath21 ( i.e. , equation 8 of vp06 ) , the scatter in the mass residuals about the 1:1 relation of 0.28 dex is only slightly larger than the scatter in the corrected fwhm - based masses ( 0.26 dex ) shown in figure [ fig : origacorrmassresid ] , albeit with an additional systematic offset of @xmath44 dex indicating a zero - point calibration difference between the full sample and vp06 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in either case ,",
    "if we adjust the zero - point of the vp06 relation to eliminate the offset , the remaining scatter about unity is only 0.26 dex , equivalent to the fwhm - corrected iv civ  masses .    because our shape correction to the iv civ  mass is a combination of only the fwhm and @xmath21",

    "results are not shown because they were only based on the n07 and a11 samples for which we had access to the data , but are consistent with using @xmath23 .",
    "this demonstrates that utilizing either ( 1 ) a combination of line width plus shape , or ( 2 ) a more complex ( i.e. , than fwhm ) characterization of the iv civ  line profile is necessary to properly calibrate iv civ  and h@xmath0  masses due to the contamination of the non - variable component of iv civ",
    ". also found that the scatter between iv civ  and h@xmath0  masses could be reduced by fitting a iv civ  mass correction based on additional iv civ  profile information , albeit with more parameters , to what we have done here .",
    "additionally , @xcite and @xcite have suggested relaxing a strict virial requirement ( @xmath19 ) altogether as a means to reduce scatter in the calibration of se mass scales due to systematic differences between various se line profiles and the rms h@xmath0  profile to which these mass scales are ultimately calibrated . found that this relaxation could also explain the `` sub - eddington boundary '' for fwhm - based bh masses , but then again , so could using @xmath21-based masses with the typical virial requirement .      while the iv civ  shape correction defined by equation ( 1 ) significantly reduces ( by 0.13 dex ) the scatter in the iv civ - to - h@xmath0  mass residuals , a scatter of",
    "@xmath10.3 dex still remains .",
    "we briefly investigated three potential sources for this remaining scatter :    1 .",

    "this suggests that the _ measured _ line width in these objects is not the _ intrinsic _ line width , so the correction to these sources was meaningless .",
    "this is a serious concern for se masses measured from survey quality spectra , which are typically of relatively low @xmath43 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and denney et al .",
    ", in prep .  for additional discussions and investigations of this concern ) .",
    "* data inhomogeneity : * as there is no universal prescription for agn spectral decomposition and line width measurements , inhomogeneity in the data analysis and computational methods used to derive se masses leads to measurable systematics when trying to compare masses between samples and emission lines .",
    "this is demonstrated by the comparison of our fwhm measurements of the n07 sample in figure [ fig : usvnetzerfwhm ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for additional sample to sample comparisons ) .",
    "there are also no universal mass scaling relationships for each emission line , and differences in the mass scale also lead to differences in masses derived by different studies ( see discussions by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "systematics : * literature comparisons between se iv civ  and h@xmath0  masses typically blame iv civ  masses for any observed inconsistencies , since h@xmath0  is arguably the most well - characterized and best - studied line in terms of direct rm - based masses for comparison . however , h@xmath0  it is not without systematics of its own , particularly contamination by nlr emission and host galaxy starlight , which are relatively unimportant for iv civ .",
    "the systematics introduced into the h@xmath0  line width and/or optical luminosity can be significant @xcite .",
    "we tested if the scatter in the iv civ - to - h@xmath0  masses could be further reduced by addressing these additional sources of scatter .",
    "first , we removed ( 1 ) single vp06 epochs with @xmath49 pixel@xmath50 in the continuum , ( 2 ) the seven objects from the n07 sample that show evidence for absorption ( we could not cull @xmath49 pixel@xmath50 data from this sample without eliminating it completely ) , and ( 3 ) the three a11 sources defined as group ii objects due to unreliable h@xmath0  widths and other issues ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    next , we removed host starlight from the vp06 sample by replacing the se h@xmath0  masses with the rm h@xmath0  masses .",
    "ideally , host starlight should be removed from all samples , but the required host fluxes are not available . in any case , the vp06 sample is the most susceptible to this bias because of its relatively lower mean agn luminosity .",
    "this choice removes some of the consistency between the treatment of this sample compared to the a11 and n07 samples , but these differences are smaller than the accuracy gained by this correction .",
    "finally , fully removing the data analysis inhomogeneity is not possible .",
    "however , we fit and defined a shape - based iv civ  mass correction independently for each sample , since the sample - to - sample inhomogeneities in the spectral fitting and line width measurement techniques have likely led to a sub - optimal iv civ  shape correlation fit based on the combined sample .",
    "we list the individual sample fit parameters and uncertainties in table [ tab_fits ] .",
    "figure [ fig : bestorigacorrmassresid ] shows the results of these modifications to our analysis .",
    "the top panel again shows the ratio of the iv civ - to - h@xmath0  masses of this `` high - quality '' sample before correcting iv civ  masses for the shape bias . here",
    "the scatter around the 1:1 relation is now 0.33 dex , and the systematic offset is small , showing that simply removing poor quality data and host galaxy starlight alone can reduce the scatter .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residuals after correcting the iv civ  masses using the individual shape corrections determined for each homogeneous sample . here",
    "the scatter is only 0.22 dex , demonstrating the iv civ  and h@xmath0  masses to be in very good agreement . the remaining scatter is less than the previously estimated intrinsic systematic uncertainties of @xmath16 dex inherent in se masses ( vp06 ) and is comparable to the uncertainty in the calibration of the @xmath8 relationship ( @xcite ,",
    "though see also @xcite for evidence that the intrinsic @xmath8 scatter is somewhat lower ) .      in their comparison of iv civ  and h@xmath0-based masses in a sample of lensed quasars , a11 discovered a strong correlation between the ratio of iv civ - to - h@xmath0  masses and the ratio of uv - to - optical luminosity .",
    "such a correlation is naively expected , since the ratio of these masses is a function of the ratio of uv - to - optical luminosity .",
    "however , the slope of the correlation measured by a11 was in excess of that expected , if the only source of the correlation was the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath6 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "interestingly , if we combine the blueshift  equivalent width relation of @xcite with the blueshift  color relation of @xcite , we expect a shape  color correlation in the sense that high ( low ) @xmath24 iv civ  profiles are seen in bluer ( redder ) agns .",
    "this means that our shape correction operates in the same sense as the a11 color correction .",
    "figure [ fig : clrshape ] shows this shape  color correlation . to be consistent , we used only se , non - host - corrected @xmath53 for all objects , which necessarily decreased the vp06 sample by six objects .",
    "we compare the statistics from this shape  color correlation with the a11 mass  color correlation , but we first subtracted the expected dependence of the a11 correlated quantities on the ratio of the luminosities by removing the the luminosity term , @xmath54 , from the a11 mass residuals .",
    "this leaves only the excess correlation observed by a11 , and is a more consistent comparison with the shape  color correlation ,",
    "in which there is no redundant dependence on luminosity in both coordinate axes .",
    "the spearman statistics listed in table [ tab_fits2 ] show that both correlations are weak , but the correlation of @xmath24 with color is the stronger of the two . since a11 did not use this combined sample to discover or define this correlation , we also make a comparison using the a11 sample alone .",
    "the fit to the a11 sample is denoted by the solid line in figure [ fig : clrshape ] , and the spearman statistics are listed the top corner as well as in table [ tab_fits2 ] .",
    "the statistics show that these correlations are still not particularly strong , but are more significant than for the combined sample ( as also noted by a11 ) .",
    "the correlation of @xmath24 with color is , again , the more statistically significant of the two .",

    "a11 originally measured this slope to be @xmath57 .",
    "we measure a new slope of @xmath58 , which is marginally consistent with the expected slope of @xmath10.53 from the mass scaling relationship dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the shape bias in the iv civmasses is a likely driver for the a11 mass  color correlation and can at least partially explain the steep slope observed by a11 .",
    "additional work is underway using a larger sample to either identify or rule out additional effects , e.g. , non - universal seds , that could also be contributing to the excess slope observed by a11 .",
    "our analyses in   [ s_rmmnrms ] and [ s : shapebias ] have shown ( 1 ) that the se iv civ  profile is a composite of both a variable ( reverberating ) component and non - variable component , and ( 2 ) that object - to - object differences in the characteristics of the non - variable component are a primary cause for the large scatter in fwhm - based se iv civ  bh masses as compared to h@xmath0  masses . here",
    "we discuss possible origins for these differences .",
    "the first , obvious , possibility is to associate the low velocity component with the `` traditional '' , low - density nlr , i.e. , the region responsible for emitting narrow forbidden lines , such as [ oiii]@xmath59 .",
    "a nlr component is observed in the h@xmath0  emission line and has sometimes been assumed to be a component of the iv civ  profile as well .",
    "however , we argue that this can not be the origin of the non - variable component of iv civ  for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "while the c+3 ion is photo - ionized , the iv1549 civ@xmath10  emission line transition is excited collisionally .",
    "photoionization models suggest that iv1549 civ@xmath10  emission from the low - density nlr region must therefore be weak .",
    "in contrast , the non - variable component seen in the mean iv civ  profiles of figure [ fig : civmnrms ] is often quite strong .",
    "admittedly , iv civ  emission is still seen in seyfert 2 spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also suggesting a possible origin in the nlr , but studies have additionally shown that nlr emission line strengths and ratios are different between seyfert 1 s and seyfert 2 s @xcite and may be dependent on inclination @xcite .",
    "2 .   not all iv civ  se profiles show an obvious narrow , core component . the presence and strength of this component is also anticorrelated with blueshift and the iv civ  equivalent width @xcite .",
    "it is much more probable that this reflects differences in the blr kinematics or geometry between objects rather than correlations between nlr and blr kinematics .",
    "a large percentage of iv civ",
    "se profile peaks are blueshifted @xcite , some by thousands of km s@xmath50 .",
    "while nlr emission can be blueshifted from the systemic redshift , it would _ not _ be expected to show these large of blueshifts .",
    "if present , nlr emission should appear at or at least near the systemic redshift , leaving it relatively redshifted with respect to the highly blueshifted iv civ  profile @xcite .",
    "one would then expect potential double - peaked profiles in these objects , rather than this component simply being absent .",
    "such a feature is not observed here , in large samples , or even in composite agn spectra ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we subtracted the scaled rms spectrum from the mean spectrum of all objects shown in figure [ fig : civmnrms ] ( except fairall 9 because of the poor quality rms spectrum ) and measured the fwhm of the residual non - variable components using the same methods as in section [ s_rmmnrms ] .",
    "we also measured the fwhm of the oiii@xmath605007 line from this sample , subtracting a linear , local continuum , from available optical data .",
    "figure [ fig : nonvarcivvsoiiiwidths ] shows that the velocity widths of the non - variable narrow cores are larger ( often significantly so ) than those measured in the unblended nlr oiii@xmath605007 line .",
    "combining these relatively broad core widths with the core strength and additional blue excess emission in most of this sample , it is unlikely that this component is , at least solely , from the traditional , low - density , extended nlr emission .",
    "the presence of a blr wind has been used to explain a wide variety of observed agn phenomena .",
    "this includes , for instance , the often blueshifted iv civ  profile ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , absorption line features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and agn outflows and feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that the sources with the largest blueshifted iv civ  profiles are the `` wind - dominated '' sources , where this wind component causes a blueshifted peak and line asymmetries ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the se iv civ  profile .",
    "these observations are consistent with the non - variable blue excess emission we observe when comparing the rm mean and rms spectra .",
    "however , we also observe a strong low - velocity , non - variable core in some objects .",
    "so in terms of the se bh mass estimates _ alone _ ,",
    "if this total non - variable component ( core @xmath61 blue excess ) is a disk - wind , it is the peaky , low @xmath24-value objects with the strongest se core components that would have the largest wind `` contamination '' or bias in their fwhm and therefore fwhm - based se mass measurements .",
    "the blr disk - wind has been suggested to be launched from the inner , _ high - velocity _ , high - ionization regions of the blr or outer accretion disk , so the additional non - variable , _ low - velocity _ core component observed here does not readily fit into this model unless there is an orientation dependence of the wind component relative to the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the rm mean and rms spectra in figure [ fig : civmnrms ] as well as iv civ  profiles in general show that the strength of the blueward asymmetric emission appears to be roughly anti - correlated with the strength of the low - velocity core ( e.g. , the blueshift  equivalent width relation discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we argue that if this non - variable component does originate in an outflowing blr wind , there _ should _ be an orientation dependence , where the change in iv civprofile from ` peaky ' to ` boxy ' , or low @xmath24 to high @xmath24 , is due to varying levels of los wind contamination to the broad emission line profile as a function of orientation .",
    "furthermore , because this component does not reverberate , such a wind would necessarily be optically thin to the ionizing continuum .    for a disk@xmath61wind blr to support our observations of the variable@xmath61non - variable iv civ  profile and put these observations in context to other iv civ  observations , an optically - thin wind that is more polar than equatorial is required . in this case iv1549",
    "civ@xmath10  can still be emitted in the wind but does not reverberate .",
    "we can then make a simple generalization for a composite `` disk '' ( variable component ) plus `` wind '' ( non - variable component ) iv civ  profile ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we would then expect the following orientation - dependence of the profile of each component :    * * the disk : * as the inclination decreases ( goes from edge - on to face - on ) , the disk component experiences a general narrowing in velocity width due to the change in inclination .",
    "there is no other a priori requirement for the shape of the line ; photoionization and blr geometry model - fits to the balmer line profiles have shown that a wide variety of both single- and double - peaked profiles can exist and still arise from a virialized disk - like distribution of gas with varying optical depths ( see review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . * * the wind : * at high ( closer to edge - on ) inclinations , the wind component is narrow and centered near the iv civ  systemic velocity , as the direction of outflow is largely perpendicular to the los .",
    "as the inclination decreases , more of the wind is observed to be outflowing along the los .",
    "consequently , the wind emission is distributed across a larger , preferentially blue - shifted , range of velocities , so the peak also blueshifts and decreases in flux .",
    "another previously suggested explanation for the peaky se core component in some iv civ  lines is that this emission arises in an `` intermediate line region '' ( ilr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a region is explained as a higher - velocity , higher - density inner ( i.e. , closer to the blr ) extension of the nlr .",
    "@xcite alternately suggest a different , simple model in which the core iv civ  emission could be coming from a bipolar outflow , but this may not be mutually exclusive to the ilr / inner nlr .",
    "more recent spatially - resolved studies of the kinematics and physical conditions in the inner nlrs of local seyferts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a link between possible ilr iv civ  emission and biconical outflows .",
    "while we mentioned above that densities in the `` typical '' , i.e. , extended , nlr are not high enough to result in significant emission from high - ionization species , spatially resolved stis spectra have co - located high - ionization - line emission with knots of [ oiii ] @xmath62 emission in the inner nlr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such emission must be enhanced by collisional processes @xcite , such as shock heating or microturbulance , mechanisms likely to be present if this emission is arising in an outflow @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that with _",
    "observations of nearby seyferts , spatially - resolved iv1549 civ@xmath10  emission does arise outside the unresolved nucleus , i.e. , from the ilr / inner nlr",
    ". however , the iv civemission flux drops significantly faster than [ oiii]@xmath59  emission as a function of radius .",
    "the spatially resolved inner knots of [ oiii ] @xmath62 emission also show relatively high , @xmath1  1000 km s@xmath50 , and even blueward asymmetric velocities @xcite , both reminiscent of the non - variable iv civcomponent we see here . unfortunately , and important for potentially characterizing the non - variable iv civ  profile , because the [ oiii ] emission extends to much larger radii and lower velocities , the line profile of the `` integrated '' [ oiii ] emission in typical ground - based spectra of both near and distant objects is not a good template match for the observed non - variable iv civ  core emission .    in this type of scenario , the non - variable component of the iv civ  line ,",
    "i.e. , both the peaky , low - velocity iv civ  core emission and blue excess , could be attributed to the ilr emission and part of a biconical outflow .",
    "los emission - line profiles from such a distribution of gas would therefore exhibit velocity widths larger than the typical , extended nlr region that is probed by integrated forbidden - line emission profiles , but narrower than typical blr emission .",
    "additionally , if the gas is outflowing , blueshifts are to be expected , and potentially more prominent for the higher gas velocities , since this emission likely arises at closer radii and may therefore by more highly collimated by the bicone .",
    "these are all expectations consistent with the observations of the iv civ  emission line profile seen here and in previous studies .",
    "furthermore , our orientation - dependent model of the non - variable iv civemission introduced above fits equally well with an origin in a biconical ilr outflow as in the blr disk - wind , since the los component from the inner region of such an ilr outflow should change as a function of orientation . such a distribution of gas would also not be expected to reverberate . because the spatial scales are large relative to the time scale of variability , any reverberation signal would be spatially damped .",
    "therefore , the non - variable nature of such an emission component naturally holds for this origin , at least on reverberation time scales .      both origins for the non - variable iv civ  component that we suggest above require an orientation dependence to the outflow component of iv civemission .",
    "we first looked for indications of an orientation dependence by comparing our orientation expectations with the iv civ  profile trends observed in the rm sample . to do this , however , we must isolate the non - variable component profile to search for signs of orientation dependence .",
    "this was done through a spectral decomposition of the mean spectrum iv civ  profiles shown in figure [ fig : civmnrms ] .",
    "we assume that the mean profile is a superposition of the blr ` disk ' ( variable component ) and outflow ( non - variable component ) .",
    "the rms profile shows variable emission only , so we generalize this emission to arise solely in the reverberating blr ` disk ' .",
    "we decompose the mean profiles into variable and non - variable components by first fitting the scaled rms profile ( solid gray curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : civmnrms ] ) with a sixth order gauss - hermite polynomial as a means to derive a smooth profile for the disk component .",
    "we subtract this component from the mean spectrum , and attribute the residual non - variable flux to the outflow component .",
    "we fit the residual emission again with a gh polynomial after interpolating over any narrow absorption features .",
    "we highlight this decomposition for the iv civ  profiles of ngc 4151 , whose mean spectrum has a relatively low @xmath24-value ( 0.61 ) with a strong non - variable core , and ngc 7469 , which has higher @xmath24 ( 0.92 ) with a notably weaker non - variable core but with additional , non - variable blue excess",
    ". the results of the decomposition for these two sources are shown in figure [ fig : diskwindprofile ] , where the original mean and rms spectrum and individual and composite ( disk plus outflow ) profile fits are shown for ngc 4151 and ngc 7469 in the top and bottom panels , respectively .    from this exercise ,",
    "we observe for ngc 4151 that ( 1 ) the rms profile ( our disk component ) is broad and double - peaked , possibly demonstrating the emission expected from an inclined disk , and ( 2 ) the relatively narrow velocity distribution of non - variable residuals would also be expected from an outflow directed largely perpendicular to the los . while the model - fit to the rms spectrum over - predicts the flux in the core , this acts only to somewhat underestimate the core strength but does not significantly change the profile of the residual non - variable component . as it would not be possible to view this broad - line agn perfectly edge - on and",
    "still see a broad - line agn ( in the unified model ) , the extended and blue - shifted wing in the non - variable component profile is also consistent with the expectations for this component arising in an outflow . for ngc 7469",
    "we see ( 1 ) a less peaky and more blueshifted outflow component and ( 2 ) a narrower disk component .",
    "these are both expected characteristics of a more face - on orientation .",
    "the combined fit conspires to produce a smooth but slightly asymmetric profile , characteristic of many se iv civprofiles .    the orientation - dependent model",
    "we describe here is naively simple .",
    "interestingly , however , our crude decomposition using two test cases from the rm sample places no a priori expectations for the profiles of the individual variable and non - variable components . yet , the results of attributing these components to a blr disk@xmath61outflow composite profile are strikingly similar to what is expected if we are viewing ngc 4151 at a higher inclination ( more edge on ) and ngc 7469 at a relatively lower inclination ( more face on ) .",
    "there are also numerous discussions in the literature of orientation dependencies to observed agn properties .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested the possibility of an orientation effect in the iv civ  blueshifts , and thus wind component , though interestingly in the opposite sense that we argue here .",
    "@xcite advocated that large blue - shifted profiles were viewed from more edge - on orientations , which follows the expectations of the largely equatorial wind in the model .",
    "however , @xcite argue against such a dependence based on radio morphology studies .",
    "other radio morphology studies also show no or only weak orientation - dependence of iv civ  widths .",
    "however , these studies are based primarily on using the fwhm , and we have shown here that iv civ  fwhm measurements are biased by the non - variable component . in fact , iv civ  profiles resulting from an orientation - dependence of the non - variable component in the sense we propose above ( creating preferentially peaky profiles for high inclination and boxy profiles for low inclination ) would act to mask the expected changes in the fwhm of the blr ` disk ' component that these studies hope to probe : the non - variable component contamination will lead to an artificially large measurement of the fwhm for low inclinations and an artificially small measurement of the fwhm for high inclinations .",
    "another place to search for possible orientation - dependent quasar phenomena is in the characteristics of broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) , which have been inferred to be viewed preferentially more edge - on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is partly because their continua are relatively more reddened than non - balqsos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , other observations and models have shown that ( 1 ) polar outflows are also capable of producing bals @xcite , ( 2 ) individual fits to bals can not constrain the geometry and orientation of the bal region @xcite , and ( 3 ) radio bal and nonbal quasars are nearly indistinguishable across a wide range of observed and physical properties , including spectral shape , spectral index , and polarization properties @xcite .",
    "this evidence suggests that bals can be observed in quasars over broad range of orientations .",
    "furthermore , discussing the results of some previous studies in the context to this simple orientation dependence of the iv civ  se profile leads to some novel interpretations of the observations ( though we do not claim to be able to explain every aspect of these observed phenomena with _ only _ inclination ) :    * the baldwin effect @xcite .",
    "we argue that the lowest equivalent width objects are those that tend to have high @xmath24 and are the most face - on .",
    "the continuum photons escaping the central source should therefore be the least obscured by other nuclear material .",
    "this will lead to a larger observed luminosity , on average , compared to higher inclination objects , which we argue are observed to have high - equivalent width , low @xmath24 profiles due to wind contamination .",
    "* nlr component removal .",
    "some studies argue the narrow iv civ  core originates in the nlr . yet ,",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the narrow - line components in iv civ  are often broader and stronger than typical , `` oiii @xmath605007-like '' , nlr emission .",
    "though @xcite found better correlations between iv civ  and h@xmath0  after removing a narrow core component , they were still left with a large scatter between their iv civ  and h@xmath0  masses . in the context of our model and other arguments in section [ s_nonblr ] ,",
    "the large scatter remaining in the @xcite results is most probably due to the uncertainty in fitting and subtracting their `` narrow '' component .",
    "since the orientation - dependent non - variable component can not simply be described as a typical nlr emission line , a traditional spectral decomposition does not work for iv civ .",
    "* `` extincted '' red wing of iv civ  ( see e.g. , composite spectra of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "past physical explanations for this phenomenon ( cf .",
    "* ) include a combination of radial gas motions and obscuration , though gaskell admits that it is questionable whether the dust grains required for such obscuration could survive in the blr .",
    "our orientation - dependent disk - outflow model explains this phenomenon simply : as the inclination decreases , the observed range of disk velocities narrows .",
    "conversely , the observed velocities of the outflow component are increasing as it becomes directed more along the los , effectively filling in the high - velocity portion of the profile previously occupied by the disk emission .",
    "however , this process is preferentially blueward asymmetric because the receding component of the outflow is not visible through the disk .",
    "this leaves the red side of the profile devoid of emission from the highest velocity gas . *",
    "correlation of blueshift with luminosity @xcite .",
    "this is expected if these are the population of objects seen more face - on .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrated with a color - blueshift distribution that large blueshift agns are less likely to have red continua , regardless of whether intrinsic or dust - reddened",
    ". this would similarly be true if we are seeing these objects more face - on . * intrinsic colors of balqsos @xcite . despite the observed trend of balqsos being more reddened than nonbal quasars",
    ", @xcite found that after correcting for smc - like dust reddening , balqsos appear to be drawn from the same parent population as nonbals ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . upon further detailed inspection of balqso properties as a function of ` intrinsic ' colors",
    ", @xcite also discovered the same nonbal quasar iv civ emission line trends of larger ( smaller ) equivalent width profiles for ` intrinsically ' red ( blue ) hibals ( their figure 9 ) .",
    "this suggests to us that the obscuration typical of balqsos may not necessarily be an orientation dependent effect ( e.g. , from a torus , which would indicate a preferential edge - on orientation ) .",
    "instead , if the iv civ  line shape trend _ is _ an orientation effect as we suggest , the obscuring regions responsible for producing bals in quasars may in fact be orientation independent .",
    "the range of observed iv civ  profiles in balqsos is then additional evidence that bals can be observed over a range in orientations .",
    "realistically , there are many geometrical , kinematical , and physical properties of the blr that could cause varying contributions from the los component of a blr disk - wind , and most likely , more than one effect is present in varying degrees for different samples of agns .",
    "for example , find that stronger core emission from an equatorial wind component can occur without requiring an inclination - dependence ; instead , it is the result of simply extending the outer radius of the wind - emitting region .",
    "we focus only on inclination here because it is arguably the simplest to conceptualize , still suffices to explain many observed trends , and fits the observations whether the non - variable emission originates in an outflow from the blr or ilr .",
    "ideally , we would like to use direct orientation measurements to corroborate our interpretation that the iv civ  profile changes are a result of an orientation - dependence of the non - variable emission .",
    "unfortunately , such orientation measurements are scarce .",
    "the most promising methods use radio morphology or nlr kinematics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned above , past radio studies may be biased by typically only using the fwhm , and these studies should be revisited ( though see * ? ? ? * who find the strongest iv civ  orientation dependence using the full width at @xmath63 peak intensity , which would be less susceptible to contamination from the non - variable core ) .",
    "ngc 3783 and ngc 4151 , two objects in our rm sample , have been targeted for nlr kinematical modeling to determine orientation .",
    "the best - fit models indicate an inclination of only @xmath64 away from the los for ngc 3783 ( t.  fischer , priv .",
    "comm . ; fischer et al .  in prep ) and @xmath65 for ngc 4151 , near the maximum expected for a type 1 spectrum @xcite . putting",
    "the relative strength of the non - variable core observed in each of these objects in figure [ fig : civmnrms ] in context to these independent orientation estimates seems to support our expectations that we are observing ngc 3783 and ngc 4151 at relatively low and high inclination , respectively .",
    "we have investigated sources for the large observed scatter between iv civ- and h@xmath0-based single - epoch agn black hole masses .",
    "our primary line of investigation was to return to the assumptions on which se bh masses are based by comparing the iv civ  profiles in the mean and rms spectra from reverberation mapping experiments .",
    "these include the requirement that the velocity width of the mean , or se profile be a reasonable representation of the rms profile width  the velocity profile corresponding to emission from reverberating gas .",
    "we found that the se or mean iv civ  emission - line profiles often have a non - variable low - velocity core component and/or blue excess that does not appear in the rms profiles and therefore does not reverberate .",
    "the presence of these non - variable components in the se iv civ  profiles are biasing iv civ - based bh mass determinations .",
    "we developed an empirical correction for this bias , applicable to fwhm - based iv civ  masses by using the observed characteristics of the iv civ  profile , which we parameterize through the ratio , @xmath66 , of the iv civ  fwhm to @xmath21 .",
    "after applying this empirical `` shape '' correction to the fwhm - based iv civ  se bh masses in a sample of @xmath67 low- and high - redshift agns with both iv civ  and h@xmath0  mass estimates , we found that the scatter in the iv civ - to - h@xmath0mass residuals is reduced from 0.39 dex to 0.26 dex for this somewhat heterogeneous sample .",
    "we then investigated the remaining scatter in the iv civ - to - h@xmath0  mass ratio by looking at other possible sources .",
    "we concluded that data inhomogeneity , poor data quality , and independent biases in the h@xmath0masses due to nlr emission and host galaxy starlight also contribute to the observed scatter .",
    "if we minimize these systematic problems , we found that we could further reduce the scatter in the iv civ - to - h@xmath0mass residuals to 0.22 dex .",
    "the significant additional decrease in this scatter as a result of applying individual shape correction factors to each smaller , more homogeneous sample suggests that a shape correction calibration determined from a highly homogeneous sample of both iv civand h@xmath0-based se masses may further reduce the mass residual scatter compared to that seen here .",
    "we are currently in the process of collecting such a sample of high @xmath43 , simultaneous observations of both the iv civ  and h@xmath0  emission line regions in a large sample of agns using the xshooter spectrograph on the vlt ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparatively smaller sample of such data ) .    finally , we investigated whether the iv civ  shape trend could also be responsible for the mass  color correlation described by a11 .",
    "we found only a weak correlation between @xmath24 with this uv - to - optical color term .",
    "however , this weak shape ",
    "color correlation had a similar slope but was actually tighter than the a11 mass  color correlation after removing the expected dependence of that correlation on @xmath6 , implying that the mass  color correlation is simply a manifestation of the iv civ  shape bias .",
    "we further supported this interpretation by demonstrating that the steep slope observed by a11 in the mass  color correlation largely disappears after applying the shape - correction defined in equation ( 1 ) to the a11 fwhm - based masses .",
    "our shape parameterization of the iv civ  line profile and correction to the fwhm - based iv civ  masses was strictly empirical in construction , and not altogether dissimilar from some previous studies .",
    "however , the additional results gleaned from the reverberation database of mean and rms iv civ  spectra led to the discovery that the observed range of se iv civ  line shapes correlates with the presence of and object - to - object differences in a non - variable emission component . the physical interpretation we suggest could explain the observed differences in this non - variable component is via orientation - dependent sight - lines of a ( largely ) polar outflow .",
    "the se iv civ  emission - line profile predictions from such a model ( peaky in more edge - on sources , boxy and blue - shifted in more face - on sources ) explains the distribution of observed se profiles as composites of both the reverberating blr emission and `` contamination '' from the orientation - dependent non - variable outflow component .",
    "this contamination biases the velocity width measured in the se spectrum relative to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the reverberating gas , thus biasing se mass estimates .",
    "the radial origin of such an outflow remains an unanswered question , however .",
    "profile and velocity width comparisons of this non - variable component with the [ oiii ] @xmath605007 emission line suggest it must be arising from closer in than the extended nlr probed by _ integrated _ forbidden line emission .",
    "however , it is difficult without further observations and advances in modeling to conclude whether the outflowing gas producing the non - variable iv civ  emission originates in an inner blr disk - wind , the intermediate line region , aka , high - velocity inner extension of the traditional nlr , or even a combination of the two . at present",
    ", we show no preference as to what that origin may be .",
    "certainly an origin in the intermediate line region produces natural mechanisms to explain the lack of variability of this component ( spatial damping ) and the orientation - dependence ( collimation in a biconical outflow ) . plus , spatially resolved biconical outflows",
    "have been shown to exist on these scales .",
    "on the other hand , such an outflow must be launched from somewhere within the unresolved nucleus .",
    "models seem to favor the inner ( high - ionization ) regions of the blr or outer accretion disk for the ultimate source of agn outflows / winds , but the orientation - dependence of such a wind is , at present , model - dependent .",
    "future observational studies could potentially constrain the physical origin of this component by studying any potential time dependence of the equivalent width and velocity profile of this component .",
    "for example , gross changes in the broad emission - line profile are observed to exist over dynamical time scales for the size of the blr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so , while we have concluded that this outflow component does not _ reverberate _ , if the origin of this component is from an intermediate line region , variability may still be expected on much longer time scales than a single reverberation campaign . if present , a measure of this variability time scale could put a constraint on the location of this emitting region . on the other hand ,",
    "if the emission is originating in an optically thin wind close to the central source , changes in the amplitude of emission may be expected with changes in the agn luminosity state .",
    "as the ionizing continuum luminosity increases and the ionization front moves outward , we may expect an increase the equivalent width of this emission because the volume and temperature of the ionized gas will also increase .",
    "regardless of the physical origin , this non - variable component is likely present in some strength and form in all se iv civ  emission lines , and we have shown it to be a large , but correctable , source of systematic bias in iv civ - based se bh mass estimates . while we suggest the possibility that the profile of this non - variable component is orientation dependent , more sophisticated models of the blr and agn central engines taking into account not only orientation , but also photoionization physics , kinematics , geometry , and even radiation pressure are needed .",
    "such models will help us to better understand the full complexity and origin of the iv civ  emission ( both reverberating _ and _ non - reverberating ) as well as other observed agn properties .",
    "quasar evolution and/or sed and @xmath68 changes with luminosity could also affect the relationship between the variable and non - variable iv civ  emission components .",
    "such changes could be independent of orientation and/or lead to different orientation dependencies as a function of these parameters , if , for instance , these physical properties effect the bicone opening angle or the driving mechanism for agn outflows .",
    "if such models and/or additional observational tests can corroborate inclination as the source or at least a large contributor to the differences in the observed iv civprofiles and for either all or even particular samples of agns , having an inclination indicator as simple as the observed se iv civ  profile could be a very powerful tool for better understanding the physics of agns and reducing systematics in both se and rm masses .",
    "as an interesting side note , if a source of this non - variable iv civemission is a blr disk - wind , we may also consider the possibility that the non - variable , high - velocity wings of h@xmath0  that disappear in rms spectra and have also been potentially attributed to emission from optically - thin gas , may also be from this same blr wind component .",
    "is emitted from larger blr radii than iv civ , so it may only be the very highest velocities of h@xmath0-emitting gas that are affected by this wind component , particularly as it has been theorized to be launched from the inner blr .",
    "in the end , however , the rms spectra derived from reverberation mapping campaigns are the only guaranteed means by which to directly probe the uncontaminated , variable profile most relevant for determining accurate black hole masses and to decompose the non - variable component by which we can study its origin .",
    "therefore , more reverberation mapping experiments targeting objects across the full observed distribution of se iv civ  profiles as well as multiple epochs for individual objects are needed ( 1 ) to expand the sample of iv civ  mean and rms spectra , ( 2 ) to form a more robust iv civ  shape correction , and ( 3 ) to better understand the extent and physical origin of this non - variable component and the bias it imposes on iv civ - based bh mass estimates .",
    "furthermore , these programs must also probe larger agn luminosities and higher redshifts so that results can more directly be applied to the typical quasar populations observed in surveys .",
    "currently , our only option is to extend what has been learned for the relatively , low - luminosity , local seyfert sample presented here .",
    "however , it is imperative for our understanding of galaxy evolution to directly test what systematics , if any , we are introducing by extending results from these local investigations to agns at higher redshifts , luminosities , and even in potentially different evolutionary states .",
