    "paper citation count itself and various quantities derived from it are used as influential indicators of research impact @xcite . at the same time , it is well known that the cumulative number of citations received by academic publications strongly depend on paper age and field  @xcite .",
    "old papers have had more time to acquire citations than recent ones , and their advantage is further enhanced by the preferential attachment mechanism @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "different academic fields adopt very different citation practices ( see @xcite for a review on the topic ) , which results in a strong dependence of the mean number of citations on academic field , as shown in several works ( @xcite , among others ) .",
    "a natural question arises : how can we `` fairly '' use citation - based indicators to compare papers from different fields and of different age ?",
    "the problem of comparing papers from different fields is usually referred to as the _ field - normalization _ problem .",
    "several approaches to address this question have been proposed in the literature ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "a particularly simple approach is to divide each paper s citation count by the mean number of citations for papers of the same field published in the same year .",
    "the results by @xcite suggested that this indicator , called _ relative citation count _",
    ", produces a ranking that is statistically consistent with the hypothesis of a ranking that is not biased by field and age .",
    "this finding has been challenged by subsequent works by @xcite and @xcite , which leaves the debate on age- and field- normalization procedures still open .    in this article",
    ", we analyze a large dataset from microsoft academic graph @xcite to show that existing indicators of impact , including the relative citation count , fail to produce rankings that are not biased by age and field . to simultaneously assess these biases , we present a new procedure based on the mahalanobis distance  @xcite .",
    "this permits to compare the ranking by a given indicator with those obtained with a simulated unbiased sampling , and hence to quantify the overall ranking bias .",
    "an analytic result derived in this paper allows us to assess the contribution of each field to the overall ranking bias .",
    "it is worth noticing that while we focus on the biases by age and field , our bias assessment procedure can be easily extended to detect any other kind of information bias .",
    "we also present the first systematic study of the possible bias by field of pagerank score @xcite and of its age - rescaled version introduced by @xcite . the motivation to analyze these network - based indicators comes from the finding that they outperform other metrics in identifying expert - selected milestone papers @xcite .",
    "however , the application of pagerank and its variants to academic citation networks focused on datasets composed of papers from a single field  @xcite . to our best knowledge ,",
    "the metric s possible bias by academic field is still unexplored and we are the first authors to address it .",
    "we introduce two novel indicators of impact motivated by the @xmath0-score : age- and field - rescaled citation count @xmath1 and age- and field - rescaled pagerank @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the novel indicators produce paper rankings that are much less biased by age and field than the rankings produced by the other analyzed indicators . nevertheless ,",
    "also the mahalanobis distance observed for the new indicators is not statistically consistent with ones obtained for a simulated unbiased process .",
    "this indicates that the problem of achieving an ideal unbiased ranking of the publications remains open .",
    "the rest of our article is organized as follows : section 2 describes the analyzed dataset of publications obtained from the microsoft academic graph .",
    "section 3 presents existing paper - level impact indicators and reports their bias by scientific field . in section 4",
    ", we introduce a rescaling procedure for citation count and pagerank scores motivated by the @xmath0-score . in section 5",
    ", we introduce a general procedure to test for any kind of ranking bias , and present its application to assess the field and age bias of the rankings by the indicators studied here . in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude by discussing possible limitations of our analysis and future research directions .",
    "we analyze a bibliographic dataset which was provided for the kdd cup 2016 .",
    "this data is a dump of the _ microsoft academic graph _ ( mag ) and contains more than 126 millions of publications and more than 467 millions citations @xcite .",
    "each publication is also endowed with various properties such as unique i d , publication date , title , journal i d , etc .",
    "we pre - processed the data ( details are provided in appendix [ app : kdd ] ) to remove from the analysis papers with incomplete information , ending up with @xmath3 unique publications and @xmath4 citations .",
    "the mag has a field classification at paper level @xcite . in the kdd cup dump , there are @xmath5 main fields and numerous subfields up to @xmath6 hierarchical levels of subsubfields .",
    "however , all the different subfields can belong to several main fields , meaning that each publication can belong to more than one main field .",
    "we use here the field classification at the highest hierarchical level , i.e. , we only consider the @xmath5 main fields . when calculating the citation count and pagerank score of papers ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : short - ex - metric ] ) , we consider the publications that belong to more than one field only once . in this way",

    "the rationale behind the application of the metric to citation networks is that not all citations should be counted the same : citations coming from influential papers should count more than citations from obscure articles .",
    "the pagerank scores of papers are usually written in a vector @xmath22 defined by the following equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant , @xmath25 is the random - walk transition matrix with elements @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the number of references in paper @xmath15 , and @xmath28 is a uniform teleportation vector with elements @xmath29 for all papers @xmath12 .",

    "these panels show that the bias by field is not limited to the top @xmath44 papers in the ranking , but it arises from systematic differences between the score distributions across different fields . for example , when looking at the distribution of @xmath7 , papers in the field of political science have consistently smaller probability to have more than one citation compared to other fields . for a detailed discussion about the bias of the ranking by @xmath18 , we refer to appendix [ appendix : radicchi ] .",

    "the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_pg_bad ] show that the top positions of both rankings are biased by field , and both rankings overestimate the impact of publications in the field of environmental science .",

    "fig : rescaled_pg_bad ] , we find that the full distribution of scores of page rank have a similar shape , but different broadness . these differences are slightly smaller for the age - rescaled pagerank , with the exception of the field of environmental science ( see bottom right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : rescaled_pg_bad ] ) .",
    "in this section , we introduce two novel indicators of paper impact : the age- and field - rescaled citation count , @xmath1 , and the age- and field - rescaled pagerank , @xmath2 .",
    "the two indicators , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are obtained from citation count @xmath7 and pagerank score @xmath9 , respectively , through a rescaling procedure .",
    "this procedure is based on the @xmath0-score and is aimed at suppressing age and field bias .",
    "it is conceptually close to the one presented by @xcite , and is an extension of those introduced by @xcite and @xcite .      to calculate the age- and field - rescaled citation count @xmath49 of a paper @xmath12 belonging to a field @xmath40 , we first compute the mean @xmath50 and the standard deviation @xmath51 of the citation count of papers of the _ same field _ and of _ similar age _ as paper @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are computed over the papers that belong to the same field @xmath40 as paper @xmath12 and that are among the @xmath52 closest papers to @xmath12 as measured by the distance @xmath53 between their rank by age .",
    "then , the age- and field - rescaled citation count score @xmath49 is defined as @xmath54 the averaging window size @xmath52 is a parameter of the method , which we set to @xmath55 .    differently from @xcite , for the computation of the @xmath0-score , we use temporal windows with the same number of publications , which in general corresponds to real - time intervals of different duration .",
    "this choice is supported by recent findings ( @xcite ) that indicate that in citation networks , time is better defined by number of publications than by real time . our analysis ( not shown )",
    "confirms that when computation temporal windows are of a fixed temporal length , the bias removal is inferior to that achieved with temporal windows containing a fixed number of publications .",
    "differently from the relative citation count @xmath8 , @xmath1 is expected to have not only uniform mean value across different publication dates and fields , but also uniform standard deviation .",
    "this should lead to a more balanced ranking of the papers .",
    "we show in the following that this is indeed the case .",
    "previous works have shown that pagerank is biased towards old papers in scientific citation networks @xcite . moreover ,",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : short - ex - metric ] that pagerank score @xmath9 is biased by scientific domain . to simultaneously suppress these two biases",
    ", we propose the age- and field - rescaled pagerank score @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 is defined similarly as @xmath1 : we compute the mean value @xmath56 and the standard deviation @xmath57 of the pagerank scores of the papers that belong to the same field as paper @xmath12 and that are among the @xmath34 closest papers to @xmath12 as measured by the distance @xmath53 between their rank by age .",
    "the age- and field - rescaled pagerank score is then defined as @xmath58 in the following , we set @xmath38 .    in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_good ] , we show that in the top-1% of the rankings by @xmath2 and @xmath1 each field appears well represented .",
    "in fact , the deviations from the expected value are very small especially if compared to the deviations of the other rankings ( see top panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_cit_bad ] and [ fig : rescaled_pg_bad ] ) . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_good ] , we report that the the full score distributions for papers from different fields collapse extremely well top of each other thanks to the rescaling procedure .",
    "we begin this section by introducing a new methodology to assess a ranking s bias based on the mahalanobis distance ( paragraph [ sec : mahala ] ) .",
    "then , we use this to quantify the bias by field ( paragraph [ sec : field_bias2 ] ) and the bias by age and field ( paragraph [ sec : field_age_bias ] ) .",
    "while figs .  [ fig : rescaled_cit_bad ] and  [ fig : rescaled_pg_bad ] illustrate the substantial field bias of the existing metrics , the bias is much weaker ( if any ) for the new age- and field - rescaled metrics in figure  [ fig : rescaled_good ] .",
    "now we quantify this improvement by extending the statistical tests of bias suppression presented by @xcite . similarly to these works , we assume that a ranking is unbiased if its properties are consistent with those of an unbiased selection process .",
    "let us first analyze the problem of assessing the bias by field . consider an urn which contains @xmath59 marbles , each of them corresponding to one of the publications present in our dataset .",
    "an _ unbiased selection process _ then corresponds to sampling from this urn at random without replacement a fixed number @xmath60 of publications . from the extracted sample ,",
    "we count the number of publications that belong to each field @xmath40 , @xmath61 , and record these numbers in the vector @xmath62 ; here @xmath63 denotes the number of fields .",
    "the probability to observe a certain vector , @xmath64 , is given by the _ multivariate hypergeomentric distribution _",
    "( mhd ) @xmath65 where @xmath42 is the total number of publications in field @xmath40 . following this selection process , among the @xmath66 extracted publications ,",
    "the expected number of publications for field @xmath40 is @xmath67 .",
    "assume that the actual ranking by a given metric @xmath45 features @xmath43 publications from field @xmath40 in the top @xmath44 of its ranking .",
    "in general , the observed @xmath43 deviates from its expected value @xmath68 .",
    "a simple approach to quantify this deviation would consist in computing the @xmath0-score , defined as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the expected standard deviation for field @xmath40 according to the mhd specified by eq .  .",
    "there are however two shortcomings of the @xmath0-score .",
    "first , the @xmath0-score only gives partial information for a mhd  how far from the expected values we are in units of standard deviations  but it does not provide information on how statistically significant the deviations are .",
    "second , to quantify the overall bias of a given indicator @xmath45 , we would need to aggregate the @xmath0-scores from the different fields .",
    "for example , we could take the average @xmath0-score , but this would neglect the correlation between the different fields coming from the constraint @xmath71 .    to overcome these two problems ,",
    "we follow a different approach .",
    "we first run various numerical simulations that reproduce the unbiased selection process .",
    "these simulations produce a set of ranking vectors which are distributed according to eq .   around the vector of expected values , @xmath72 .",
    "differently from  @xcite , we do not estimate the confidence interval for the different fields separately .",
    "we calculate instead the mahalanobis distance ( @xmath73 ,  @xcite and appendix [ app : md ] ) for each simulated vector from @xmath74 , and construct the distribution of @xmath73 s obtained by the simulated unbiased selection process .",
    "the inset of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : md_field ] reports the distribution of the @xmath73 for @xmath75 simulations .",
    "the distribution is centered around its mean value of @xmath76 and the upper bound for the @xmath77 confidence level is around @xmath78 . for the unbiased sampling process",
    "is extremely close to the number of degrees of freedom of our problem .",
    "this stems from the fact that the mhd defined by eq",
    ".   converges to a multivariate gaussian distribution ( mgd ) as we increase the number of publications @xmath59 while keeping @xmath79 fixed and small .",
    "our dataset is large enough for this approximation to be accurate .",
    "the @xmath80 of a mgd is distributed as a @xmath81 variable with average equal to the number of degrees of freedom , i.e. 18 since we have 19 distinct fields and one constraint . ] for an _ ideal unbiased ranking _ , we would expect its @xmath73 to fall into the @xmath77 confidence interval of the distribution of the @xmath73 obtained from the simulated unbiased sampling process .",
    "the methodology presented above is easily generalized to simultaneously assess a ranking s bias by age and field .",
    "to add the temporal dimension to the bias assessment procedure , we split the publications into @xmath82 equally - sized age groups , and repeat the above analysis by using @xmath83 different categories of publications . in sec .",
    "[ sec : field_age_bias ] , we set @xmath84 representing the number of fields and @xmath85 as in @xcite , and thus we obtain @xmath86 age - field groups of different sizes .          the rankings produced by different metrics differ greatly by their @xmath73 ( see fig .  [ fig : md_field ] ) . as expected , the metrics that are not field - rescaled ( @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 ) are far from being unbiased . at the same time , relative citation count that is rescaled by field performs only slightly better than pagerank which is ignorant of any field information .",
    "the best results by a wide margin are achieved by our metrics , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , obtained using the new rescaling .",
    "nevertheless , both these metrics fail to meet the 95% upper bound achieved by simulated unbiased rankings . as disappointing as it may seem , this finding is not entirely surprising as the proposed rescaling procedures focus on equalizing the first two moments of the respective quantities ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) whereas the quantities distributions can differ also by higher moments .    to understand which field contributes the most to the resulting @xmath73 values",
    ", we derived an alternative analytic expression for the @xmath73 @xmath87 where we omit the metric superscript @xmath88 from the notation for @xmath89 and @xmath64 for simplicity .",
    "we have proven this formula analytically for @xmath90 , and we have numerically tested it for @xmath84 and @xmath86 ( see appendix [ app : md ] ) ; it remains open to prove it in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      we first observe that the distributions of both incoming and outgoing edges are broad ( see fig .  [ distribution ] ) .",
    "both these distribution in fact have long and heavy tails .",

    "for example , publications belonging to the field of environmental science and of political science have mean citation count two times bigger and smaller , respectively , compared to the average citation count across all fields .",
    "in agreement with the findings by @xcite , the strong variety in mean citation count per publication for the various fields confirms that the corresponding communities exhibit different citation behavior , which calls for field normalization procedures .          here , we address the following question : to which extent is the kdd dump of the mag in accordance with the most updated online version of the mag ? for this comparison , we divided the @xmath91 analyzed paper - field pairs ( one paper - field pair is composed of a paper and the fields that paper belongs to ) into @xmath86 age and field groups , as described in sec .",

    "for the matched papers ( @xmath96 of the sample ) , we compared the number of citations reported in the kdd dump of the mag with the number of citations reported on the online version of the mag .",

    "in addition , about @xmath97 of the matched papers have errors in their citation count .",
    "this means that we have correct citation information for about @xmath98 of the analyzed papers .",

    "therefore , we can diagonalize it , @xmath130 where the columns of @xmath131 form an orthonormal basis ; we can also write @xmath132 . with this , we have @xmath133 , where \\{@xmath134 } are the eigenvalues of @xmath135 and \\{@xmath11 } are the coordinates of @xmath136 in the basis which diagonalizes @xmath135 , i.e. @xmath137 where the last equality comes from the orthonormality of @xmath131 which implies @xmath138 . ]",
    ". the results of the three methods were all compatible with each other up to 10 decimal digits . the advantage of using eq .",
    "is that we can calculate the @xmath73 between two arbitrary vectors without dealing with any ( computationally slow ) matrix inversion or diagonalization , and the number of needed calculations scales linearly with the number of dimensions .",
    "importantly , eq .   allows also to assess the individual contribution of each dimension ( i.e. of each category ) to the @xmath139 . to our best knowledge ,",
    "we are the first ones to have derived such explicit formula for @xmath73 when the covariance matrix and the random vectors come from a mhd .",
    "according to @xcite , the distribution of the @xmath8 indicator is log - normal : @xmath140 ^ 2/2\\sigma^2}dc^f\\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 is fitted from the data . when eq .",
    "is verified , then also the distributions of citation count , @xmath11 , for all the individual fields , @xmath12 , are lognormal : @xmath143 ^ 2/2\\sigma^2}dc_i\\ ] ] where @xmath144 is the mean of @xmath11 . for lognormal distributions",
    "the variance is proportional to the square of the mean and the constant of proportionality is @xmath145 . from eq .  , we see that the citation counts @xmath11 are distributed lognormally with mean @xmath146 and variance @xmath147 . recalling that @xmath141",
    ", we have that the mean is @xmath144 , as it is expected , while the variance becomes @xmath148 .",
    "thus , when eq .",
    "is verified , the variance of the empirical distribution of the citations for each field has to be proportional to the square of the mean citation count .",
    "moreover , the constant of proportionality has to be @xmath145 for every field and year .",
    "the analytic result just presented is in line with the eq .",
    "( c.1 ) given in appendix c of @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that a rescaling procedure based on diving the original score by their first moment works if the ratio between standard deviation and mean is constant . in the case of the relative citation ratio",
    ", we can calculate analytically such constant using the lognormal distribution and obtain the fitting parameter @xmath149 .",
    "obtained by calculating the empirical ratio , @xmath150 , between the variance and the square of the mean citation count of each field and year .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfc_universal ] , we report the distribution of @xmath149 obtained by calculating the empirical ratio between the variance and the square of the mean , @xmath151 , and by inverting the relation @xmath150 for every field and year . if the universality claim was correct , we would expect a narrow distribution of @xmath152 .",
    "by contrast , we find that @xmath149 ranges between @xmath153 and @xmath154 across different fields and years .",
    "we argue that the broad range of @xmath152 is the reason why the first moment rescaling introduced in @xcite does not work in the analyzed dataset .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : quant - rank - bias - by - field - and - age ] , we have shown that the rankings by citation count and pagerank can be substantially leveled off across different fields and age groups through a rescaling procedure based on the @xmath0-score .",
    "the two resulting indicators , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , are the least biased among the indicators considered in this paper .",
    "it is important to notice that while citation count has a direct interpretation and it is widely used in research evaluation ( @xcite ) , pagerank score is a more sophisticated quantity which has not yet be turned into a standard tool for research assessment .",
    "if the rankings by rescaled pagerank and rescaled citation count brought similar information , rescaled citation count might be preferred due to its simpler interpretation and easier computation .    differently from the citation count",
    ", pagerank score uses information on the whole network topology to compute each paper s score . while there exists no universal criterion to decide whether pagerank score leads to a better ranking than the citation count",
    ", the results by @xcite and @xcite suggest that in citation networks , pagerank score improves our ability to find groundbreaking publications in the data . on the other hand ,",
    "a node that received many citations is more likely to achieve larger pagerank score ",
    "@xcite showed that pagerank score is on average proportional to citation count for uncorrelated networks .",

    "_ we focus on two correlations : ( 1 ) the correlation between citation count and pagerank , which has been of interest for previous studies ( @xcite ) due to the essential role played by pagerank algorithm in determining the success of google s web search engine ; ( 2 ) the correlation between the two rescaled indicators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the measured correlations are all positive , significantly larger than zero , yet significantly smaller than one ( see table [ tab : corr ] ) .",
    "this is interesting as it may point out that , in analogy with the findings by @xcite and @xcite , network topology brings useful information that is neglected by citation count . whether the additional information used by pagerank metric can be used to identify groups of significant papers will be the subject of future research .",
    "differently than the rankings by citation count and pagerank score ( not shown here ) , the top papers identified by @xmath1 and @xmath2 come from diverse historical period and diverse fields . due to the lack of time bias ,",
    "also very recent papers can reach the top of the rankings by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it would be instructive to look at the top papers as ranked by rescaled citation count and rescaled pagerank .",
    "however , the original mag datasets presents noisy entries , as reported by the kdd cup 2016 ( see appendix [ app : kdd ] for more details ) , and it causes the scores of some recent papers to be over - estimated , which makes some of the entries in the top-@xmath165 of the rankings by the rescaled scores unreliable .",
