    "the broken supersymmetry is favorite among the different extensions of the standard model .",
    "it can happen that superpartners of top - quarks ( _ stops _ , @xmath5 ) are long - living enough to compose ( colorless ) bound states , _ stoponiums _ , denoted as @xmath6 in what follows . in this scenario experimental study of the corresponding resonances",
    "could provide precise value of stop mass and stoponium partial widths , consequently yielding precise values of various parameters of susy lagrangian . then",
    ", if the difference between stop and lsp masses is very small , the search for stop evidence in collisions at high energy could be problematic .",
    "observation of stoponium bound states will be the signature of such models confirming the existence of stop .",
    "there are theoretical motivations for stop to be fairly light .",
    "first one appeals to the renormalization group behavior of soft mass terms .",
    "indeed , gauge couplings raise while yukawa couplings reduce these terms when energy scale evolves down , with yukawa contributions being very large for stop .",
    "the next motivation concerns left - right mixing in squark sector , which is proportional to yukawa coupling and decreases the mass of the lightest stop . therefore , light stop may appear in different susy models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for examples in the frameworks of supergravity and gauge mediation ) .",
    "experimental bound on stoponium mass comes from searches for stop at lep2 and tevatron , it depends on the mssm spectrum  @xcite : lower bound is about 90 gev for sneutrino masses larger than 45 - 50 gev or for neutralino masses larger than 50 gev ( aleph ) , while cdf excludes stop mass up to 130 gev for smaller sneutrino masses . the limitation is weaker if stop and neutralino masses are degenerate , it is about 60 gev ( aleph ) .",
    "stoponium was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail , in particular its effective couplings and partial widths were calculated , and prospects to be discovered at lhc were estimated . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was briefly mentioned also the possibility to observe stoponiums in photon collisions , however , without analyzing this phenomenology .",
    "the first look at the plc prospects on the stoponium search was done in @xcite .",
    "now , when main parameters of tesla project are under technical discussionnjwalker / ecfa - desy - wg4/parameter_list.html for current tesla reference parameter set ] one should understand clearly signatures of stop bound states in @xmath7 and @xmath0 collisions , and compare potentials of these two options of future linear collider .",
    "in present analysis we will use year integrated luminosity for the @xmath7 option equal to 300 fb@xmath8 for @xmath9 gev , and one should rescale this figure for lower collision energies approximately as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "beamstrahlung and isr will affect considerably the stoponium production rate due to a condition to tune the collision energy at the resonance point . according to the current tesla reference parameter",
    "set the average energy loss due to beamstrahlung is about 3% .",
    "the average energy loss due to isr is about 5% @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the luminosity distribution has a characteristic width about 5% .    however , stoponium is very narrow resonance , even more narrow than the initial beam energy spread .",
    "its production rate is proportional to the differential luminosity , @xmath11 , at the @xmath12 peak , where @xmath13 is a collision energy for hard subprocess .",
    "the initial ( beam ) energy spread for energies 200500 gev is about 0.070.1% and it is determined by the bunch compression system and undulator for the positron production .",
    "the fraction of the luminosity in this @xmath140.1% peak is determined by the isr and beamstrahlung .",
    "the isr leaves in this peak about 50% of the luminosity  @xcite .",
    "the average number of beamstrahlung photons with the energy more than @xmath15 is about @xmath16 per electron for tesla conditions .",
    "thus , the probability of the collision without such beamstrahlung photons can be estimated as @xmath17 the probability of events without any photons ( isr or beamstrahlung ones ) with the energies greater 0.1% is @xmath18 so , about 17% of the luminosity is concentrated in @xmath140.1% range .",
    "the differential luminosity in this peak is higher than in 5% interval by a factor of @xmath19 times ( here factor 0.8 is due to isr in the 5% region ) .",
    "this peak could be very important factor for increasing significance of the resonance ( when its mass is known ) , for measurement of its mass and even for resolving close excited states of the stoponium .",
    "note , however , that for a search for the stoponium this peak will not help , because in presence of large background the scanning time in some wide energy interval , required for the resonance observation , has the following dependence on the bin width @xmath20 and the differential luminosity , @xmath21 ( here bin @xmath20 corresponds to the effective width of the luminosity distribution in the peak ) .",
    "so , the ratio of scanning times for the 5% and the 0.1% width peaks is @xmath22 , almost the same .",
    "photon colliders based on compton backscattering of laser photons on high energy electrons has been proposed a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "this option has been included in the tesla conceptual design report  @xcite and work on the technical design report is under way . since the cdr parameters of tesla were changed and luminosities have grown both in  and  collisions .    at the present workshop",
    "it was reported @xcite that plc luminosity can be further increased by a factor of 2.5 due to possible decrease of the horizontal beam emittance at the tesla damping ring ( however this has not improved  luminosity because it is restricted by collision effects ) . at present",
    "the  luminosity within the 20% interval just below @xmath23 could be about 40% of luminosity in the   collisions ( where @xmath24 at @xmath25 gev ) . in the analysis",
    "we will consider 60 fb@xmath8 for plc year luminosity at @xmath26 gev .",
    "the most bright evidence of the narrow resonance is its direct s - channel production in @xmath7 annihilation or @xmath0 fusion .",
    "one can note , that high powers of the coupling constants , @xmath27 , emerge in the squared matrix elements in the @xmath7 annihilation into stoponium .",
    "indeed , @xmath28 arises from two electroweak vertices , and @xmath29 comes from squared derivative of the stoponium wave function ( scalar stoponium can be created there only in p - wave by propagation of neutral vector particle : photon or @xmath30 boson ) . at the same time",
    "two powers of @xmath31 are eliminated in the case of @xmath0 fusion mechanism because the stoponium production can be proceeded in s - wave there .",
    "this circumstance makes for the relative enhancement of the stoponium production rate at plc in comparison with @xmath7 option .",
    "two powers of @xmath31 are eliminated also in the case of associated production of stoponiums , for example in the _ higgs - like _",
    "reactions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "hereafter we denote stoponium as @xmath6 .    to complete this brief review of possible production mechanisms",
    "one can note that in hadron collisions the stoponium resonance production is available in s - wave through the gluon fusion . here",
    "the effective @xmath34 vertex includes @xmath35 and one can anticipate large stoponium cross sections .",
    "however , main decay channel @xmath36 is too dirty due to huge qcd @xmath37 background .",
    "then , the most promising decay channel at lhc is @xmath0 @xcite , but in order to discover stoponiums one year of lhc operating at high luminosity is needed , or even more depending on susy scenario .",
    "we consider stoponium mass range @xmath38  gev , which could be surely probed by _ first _",
    "tesla run .",
    "it is worth to note that the same interval is not an exceptional case for susy models with stoponiums as a quasistationary state , as we discuss briefly in the next section .",
    "cross sections for various tree - level background processes were evaluated with the help of comphep package @xcite .",
    "it is clear that gluons try to bind two stops as well as ordinary quarks .",
    "the corresponding bound state can be described as a quasistationary system with energy levels @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and masses @xmath41 similarly to quarkonium . for stoponium mass @xmath42  gev the binding energies",
    "@xmath39 are of order 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "this treatment is valid if the formation process ( time scale @xmath43 ) is faster than destroying one .    among destroying mechanisms",
    "the obvious ones are the stop decays : @xmath44lsp , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . at first , let us consider the third decay .",
    "it proceeds only through loop diagrams , if universal boundary condition on soft terms is imposed ( that is motivated by the absence of fcnc ) .",
    "so , partial width is highly reduced by a factor of @xmath47 in comparison with the first two tree - level decay processes  @xcite .",
    "the rates of latter decays depend on the parameters of the model . as an example , in the framework of gravity mediation , where lsp is neutralino , these decays proceed at the tree level and the corresponding partial widths are of order _ o_@xmath48 . in the framework of models with",
    "gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite , where lsp is gravitino , the first process is strongly suppressed by supersymmetry breaking scale , but remaining one has the same partial width as in gravity mediation .",
    "hence , the possibility of existence of stoponium is a subject of special study in each concrete model .",
    "for instance , in models with the lightest chargino being mostly wino and the lightest stop being mostly right stop ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) , decay into chargino is damped and stoponium could exist if @xmath50 , i.e. , when the first decay channel is kinematically forbidden .",
    "one can state that susy scenario , where tree - level decays , @xmath44lsp and @xmath51 , are somehow suppressed and , therefore , stop decay can not destroy the stoponium formation , is not an exceptional case .",
    "next destroying mechanism is related to the stop annihilation . here",
    "two gluon channel is always open with partial width about 1 mev .",
    "generally the gluon channel is dominant .",
    "however , for the certain choice of model parameters , partial width into two lightest higgs bosons , @xmath3 , can be larger , increasing the stoponium total width by a factor of @xmath52 . in ref .",
    "@xcite these figures were analyzed and found that quasistationary description is valid for @xmath53  gev in models with forbidden stop tree - level decays and neutralino being mostly bino .",
    "the worst case is a model with chargino and neutralino states are both higgsino - like . here",
    "the stoponium total width increases rapidly with @xmath54 and quasistationary treatment fails for @xmath55  gev .",
    "let us begin with study of stoponium events in photon - photon scattering . the main effect associated with stoponium would be a direct resonance production , where stoponium is produced in spin 0 state .",
    "the corresponding cross section is described by the breit - wigner formula ( similarly to the light higgs production discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is squared colision energy for hard subprocess , @xmath58 is the stoponium partial width for the decay into state @xmath59 , @xmath60 is stoponium total width , @xmath61 are helicities of initial photons .    at photon colliders",
    "the width of the luminosity distribution is much wider than that of the stoponium .",
    "after integration over the luminosity distribution we obtain the effective cross section @xmath62 the differential luminosity , @xmath63 , at @xmath64 can be estimated as @xmath65 according to 15% width of the high energy luminosity peak ( note , we define the  luminosity as the luminosity in the interval @xmath66% ) .",
    "so the effective cross section is @xmath67 photon beams are planned to be highly polarized .",
    "hence , as stoponium is a scalar the production cross section will be enhanced by factor two if initial photons have total helicity equal to zero .",
    "hereafter we assume initial total helicity 0 ( @xmath68 ) in numerical estimates . finally , we parameterize the stoponium cross sections as follows @xmath69 one should take into account that squared stoponium wave function at the origin , attending in @xmath70 , scales as a square root of its mass  @xcite .",
    "as it has been stressed above one can discuss two main variants of the susy models , one with dominant @xmath36 decay mode and another with stoponium total width being saturated by @xmath71 mode .",
    "let us make qualitative _ signal / background _ analysis for different decay channels within these two variants .",
    "the signal significance can be evaluated by ratio @xmath72 because one deals with resonance and background rate in the signal bin can be fixed as average cross section in neighboring bins ( here @xmath73 are numbers of signal and background events ) .",
    "we used the results for stoponium width and branching ratios calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with some corrections  @xcite .    * 1 . * in the first scenario stoponium total width @xmath74  mev and photon - photon branching is @xmath75 . by making use of eq.([gamgam ] ) one obtains the signal rate at the level of 110 fb for @xmath76",
    "so , more than six thousand stoponiums will be produced per year if _",
    "l_@xmath77 fb@xmath8 .",
    "background is two jet production , where subprocess @xmath78 gives main contribution with very large unpolarized cross section , @xmath79 pb , if optimal cut on the jet angle of 45@xmath80 is applied .",
    "however , production of fermions is suppressed in collisions of photons with the total helicity 0  @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is velocity of the quarks .",
    "so , @xmath83 pairs are produced only in collisions of photons with the total helicity 2 .",
    "this fact is used for suppression of similar background in the analysis of the higgs production in  collisions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding luminosity spectra for total helicity 0 ( @xmath84 ) and 2 ( @xmath85 ) can be found elsewhere @xcite . in the region @xmath8610% near the maximum energy ( detector resolution or intrinsic resolution of the plc for two collinear jets ) one",
    "can obtain the ratio of the luminosities @xmath87 , that assumes at least one order suppression of the @xmath83 background .",
    "note that the cross section 6 pb for background corresponds to the case of unpolarized beams .",
    "it is zero for collisions of photons with the total helicity 0 and is equal to 12 pb for the total helicity 2 , therefore the remaining cross section is 1.2 pb . note that due to gluon emission @xmath83 pairs can be produced even in collisions of photons with the total helicity 0 .",
    "detailed studies have shown that with proper cuts this process is not important @xcite and contribution from resolved photons is also not significant @xcite .    furthermore , the cross section is proportional to the fourth power of the electric charge of quarks , so the main contribution is given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 quarks .",
    "the later can be easily suppressed by the vertex detector .",
    "this gives additional factor of 2 in the background suppression .",
    "additional improvement can give the detector energy resolution which is at least factor of 2 smaller than the width of the  luminosity peak .",
    "all three methods give a suppression factor of 40 .",
    "the remaining background is about 0.3 pb , while the isotropic signal is smaller by factor 1.4 only if the cut on the jet angle of 45@xmath80 is applied . hence in the scenario with dominant @xmath36 channel",
    "the _ signal / background _ ratio is @xmath90 .",
    "the signal significance is about 35 for 60 fb@xmath8 and @xmath76  gev .",
    "these figures can be related to the first year of plc operation if the stoponium mass is known approximately , for example from the observation of the direct stops production at lhc . in opposite case , for a search of a stoponium one should make scanning with the energy bin @xmath91 10% .",
    "it is clear that stoponium can be found in this scenario during several month work in the whole energy region under discussion , 200 - 400 gev .    for two photon channel the background process , @xmath92 ,",
    "proceeds through one - loop diagrams , so the corresponding cross section is small , about 10 fb  @xcite .",
    "one should note that the photon - photon invariant mass bin can be taken equal to @xmath93 for cms - like crystal electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath94 gev window the background rate can be estimated at the level of 1 fb .",
    "the signal rate is @xmath95 fb for @xmath96 gev , providing the signal significance about @xmath97 for statistics 60 fb@xmath8 .",
    "some other decay channels in the framework of the first scenario should be discussed . first note ,",
    "that @xmath98 final state has no chance for the detection of stoponiums due to huge sm background , @xmath99 pb at @xmath100 gev .",
    "more promising are decay channels with background processes emerging due to the higher order corrections from perturbation theory .",
    "for instance , sm background to @xmath101 and @xmath102 final states comes from 1 ) one - loop @xmath103 processes @xmath104 ( @xmath105 fb  @xcite ) and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 fb  @xcite ) , and 2 ) from tree - level @xmath108 processes ( e.g. @xmath109 for @xmath110 ) , with total cross section smaller than 1 fb within cuts on final @xmath111 and jets reasonably motivated by 2-body ( @xmath112 ) kinematics of the signal events .",
    "as to signal @xmath113 rate one can get from ref .",
    "@xcite the branching @xmath114 , so @xmath115 fb already for @xmath76 gev .",
    "it means very low level of the signal significance , lower than 0.5 for statistics 60 fb@xmath8 .",
    "natural level of @xmath102 branching is about @xmath116 for stoponium masses far from the threshold , 250 - 400 gev , although in some points it could fall down due to opening of new channels or degeneration of stoponium and higgs masses .",
    "this provides signal rate @xmath117 fb for @xmath118 gev and significance at the level of 2.7 if one uses formula ( [ gamgam ] ) .",
    "however , the threshold effect is significant still for this value of the stoponium mass , and these figures should be improved to 1.8 fb for signal rate and to 2 for the significance .",
    "the @xmath71 decay channel , where @xmath119 is the lightest higgs boson , is open if @xmath120 . as current limit on @xmath119 mass",
    "is about 80 - 100 gev this channel could exist for @xmath121 gev .",
    "if consider mass region not very close to the threshold ( say @xmath55 gev for @xmath122 gev ) the @xmath71 branching is about @xmath123 or even higher . in this case",
    "the signal rate is about 1  fb or larger , if one uses formula ( [ gamgam ] ) , and if take into account the threshold factor one gets signal cross section at the level of 0.2 fb or larger .",
    "the background from direct double @xmath71 production through one - loop diagrams can be estimated by the cross section of this process in sm , @xmath124 fb @xcite .",
    "there are no reasons for very large additional contributions to this process in supersymmetric models .",
    "then , we found that direct electroweak production of four b quarks ( @xmath125 ) together with contribution from @xmath126 final state ( assuming 10% of @xmath127 misidentification ) has the rate smaller than 0.1 fb .",
    "these cross sections for background processes correspond to 15% width of the  luminosity spectrum .",
    "the detector resolution is at least factor of two better ( full width ) , therefore the total cross section of background processes can be estimated as ( 0.2 + 0.1)/2 = 0.15 fb .",
    "we see that @xmath71 decay can also be studied in the considered scenario . for @xmath128  gev , @xmath122 gev and 60 fb@xmath8 integrated luminosity",
    "about 20 stoponium events will be produced in the decay channel @xmath3 with @xmath129 ratio about 2.3 and statistical significance about 7 .    in fig .",
    "[ gg - fig ] the signal significances are represented for main stoponium decay channels in the case of the first scenario . as a resume for this scenario",
    "we conclude that stoponium can be found at plc during several months scan of the 200400 gev region in @xmath36 and @xmath71 decay modes .",
    "if its mass is known approximately , it will be found during first weeks .",
    "more than a year is necessary in order to observe stoponium in @xmath0 and @xmath102 channels .",
    "note that lhc ( at the high luminosity operating stage ) has good prospects to observe light stoponium in @xmath0 mode in this scenario  @xcite .",
    "thus , these two colliders could be complementary in study of different effective stoponium couplings , @xmath130 and @xmath131 at lhc and the photon collider , respectively and @xmath132 at plc if this decay channel is open kinematically .",
    "* 2 . * in the second scenario stoponium total width could be about 10 mev or even larger .",
    "the photon - photon branching in this case is smaller , @xmath133 .",
    "so , about thousand of stoponiums will be produced per year and almost all of them will decay to pairs of lightest higgs bosons .",
    "this result suggests , that stoponium will be discovered practically immediately after plc start , since the background ( @xmath71 , @xmath134 ... ) is very small .",
    "again the scanning over the energy interval is necessary if the stoponium mass is not known . in fig .",
    "[ hh - fig ] the year yields of stoponiums are represented for different masses of lightest higgs bosons .",
    "due to rather high statistics for the signal and absence ( practically ) of the background one gets plc as a _",
    "stoponium factory_. the detailed study of the stoponium characteristics will be available in this case , in particular measurement of its mass and total width and effective couplings @xmath132 and @xmath130 .",
    "one can stress the importance of study the @xmath132 coupling , which relates directly to the _ stop - higgs _ interaction and , thus , to the mechanism of the superpartner mass generation .",
    "note that in this scenario several years of operating at high luminosity is needed in order to observe stoponium at lhc @xcite .",
    "first we discuss direct resonant production of stoponiums in @xmath7 collisions where initial electron and positron would be in p - state ( thus , stoponium is produced in spin 1 state ) . as in case of @xmath0 collisions",
    "one gets for narrow resonance after the integration of breit - wigner distribution the following formula for production cross section @xmath135 where @xmath136 are helicities of initial electrons and positrons .",
    "the differential luminosity at @xmath64 can be estimated as @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is a fraction of the @xmath7 luminosity corresponding to some interval @xmath20 near the @xmath139 peak .",
    "let us consider two methods of the stoponium detection :    \\1 ) @xmath140% @xmath141 , @xmath142% ;    \\2 ) @xmath143% @xmath141 , @xmath144% .",
    "then , the stoponium partial width into @xmath7 pair , @xmath145 , is equal to  @xcite @xmath146 with @xmath147 being wave function of p - state . in correspondence with ref .",
    "@xcite one can approximate @xmath148  gev .",
    "we assume , also , 80% circular polarization for the electron beam and 60% for the positron beam , and neglect fairly weak enhancement by @xmath30-boson pole for light stoponiums .    finally , for the first method of the stoponium detection one gets for the production rate in @xmath7 collisions the following estimate @xmath149 while it is about 5 times larger in case of second method .",
    "let us now consider background for the direct resonance production of stoponiums in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "one should note that stoponium , being produced in excited state with spin 1 , will be transfered to the basic state with spin 0 by the emission of a photon .",
    "therefore , one can consider decay modes of scalar stoponium in case of @xmath7 production as well .",
    "then , additional photon emmited by excited stoponium could be used for further suppression of the background .",
    "however , the detection of this photon could be not easy because its energy is rather small , of order 1 gev .    in the case of first mssm scenario with @xmath36 decay channel being dominant",
    "the main background is @xmath150 process .",
    "it has a cross section about 10 pb for @xmath151",
    "so , this channel is too dirty with negligible significance .    in the case of second mssm scenario with @xmath71 dominant decay mode",
    "almost all stoponiums will decay into pair of lightest higgs bosons , and the number of events for @xmath152 gev and 100 @xmath4 is 5 ( 25 ) ( the second number is for the case of seating on the 0.1% luminosity peak ) . as direct pair production of higgs bosons , @xmath153 , is negligible since the corresponding @xmath154 coupling includes electron mass , this channel is should be practically free of background . indeed",
    ", direct production of four b - quarks in electron - positron collisions has very small cross section if exclude @xmath30 peaks ( less than 0.05fb if apply the cut @xmath155 gev ) .",
    "so , stoponium can be observed at @xmath7 machine if the collision energy is tuned at @xmath54 .",
    "note , that in this scenario the yield of stoponiums at plc with @xmath156 is higher than that in  collisions by a factor of 250(50 ) ( second number for the case of seating on the 0.1% peak of the @xmath7 luminosity ) .",
    "thus , the scanning time in  mode will be about factor of 500 longer than at plc due to smaller cross section and smaller energy bin ( see also discussion on the scanning time in the introduction ) .",
    "the second effect related to stoponium at @xmath7 collider would be a production in higgs - like channels .",
    "in present analysis we neglect higgs - stoponium mixing as well as higgs influence on stoponium - involved processes .",
    "first , let us evaluate effective coupling constants between stoponium and weak bosons , @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 where we used stoponium wave function evaluated at the origin in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath160 and @xmath161 are corresponding amplitudes of @xmath162 processes evaluated in ref .  @xcite . certainly , these effective couplings are obtained with all particles being on - shell , that is rather rough approximation .",
    "however , one can hope that it is acceptable for the estimate .",
    "the calculation with the effective couplings above gives the cross section about 0.03 fb for @xmath163 ( in case of no mixing in stop sector and @xmath164  tev ) .",
    "so , only a few signal events will be produced for 100 fb@xmath8 statistics .",
    "the @xmath165 background is too heavy for this level of the signal , so only the second scenario could have some prospects .",
    "the main background will come from associated double higgs bosons production , @xmath166 , the corresponding cross section is of order @xmath167 fb for @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "it gives the signal significance less than 1 .    in the case of @xmath13-fusion",
    "the signal cross section is very small , less than @xmath169 fb , that closes this channel .",
    "in two considered scenarios of supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( 1st one with dominant @xmath36 decay mode , and @xmath71 being dominant in 2nd scenario ) photon linear collider will be the best machine to discover and study bound state of stops , if it exists .    in case of 1st scenario stoponium",
    "will be observed at plc in the @xmath36 and @xmath71 ( later if permitted kinematically ) in the beginning of the operation ",
    "several months for scanning of whole energy region or several weeks if the stoponium mass is approximately known .",

    "stoponium discovery mass range will be limited only by attainable values of the @xmath0 collision energy , which is discussed up to @xmath170 gev .",
    "the tuning of plc collision energy at the resonance point is necessary within the 15% window .",
    "these estimates were done for the case of plc year luminosity being 60 fb@xmath8 .    in @xmath7 collisions stoponium",
    "could be observed only in the scenario with @xmath71 decay channel being dominant , but with the rate lower than in the plc case by a factor of 250 ( 50 ) ( the second number for seating on the 0.1% luminosity peak ) . in this comparison",
    "it was assumed that luminosity in the high energy peak is equal 40% of  luminosity .",
    "search time here is about 500 times longer than in  collisions .",
    "however , there is one important advantage of  collisions : by use of very monochromatic part of the luminosity spectrum ( 0.1% ) one can make precise measurement of the stoponium mass and resolve its excited states .",
    "although this is possible only in the scenario when @xmath71 decay dominates .    a few further comments can be made .",
    "the first one is related to the circumstance that at photon colliders ground state of stoponium could not be distinguished from excited states due to the detector resolutions .",
    "therefore , the resonance peak will include contributions from ground state and all excitations , leading to enhancement factor of about 2 in all cross sections  @xcite .",
    "at the same time there is a big uncertainty because of poor understanding of the stoponium wave function , that results in 30 - 50% error when the stoponium rates are estimated  @xcite .",
    "then , stoponium has the same quantum numbers as neutral higgs bosons .",
    "thus , interesting phenomena could appear due to the interference of stoponium with higgs sector .",
    "this point was discussed briefly in ref .",

    "<S> thus , several weeks run is sufficient for the discovery of stoponium , if its mass is approximately known ( for example from observation of direct stops production at lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , in mssm scenarios with dominant @xmath3 decay plc shows excellent possibilities to discover bound state of stops , practically immediately after beginning of operating . </S>",
    "<S> thus , plc has good possibilities to study strong interaction of top quark superpartners in nonperturbative regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the  option also has some prospects to observe stoponium but only in the case of scenarios with dominant decay into two lightest higgs bosons , with tens of events per 100 @xmath4 . </S>",
