    "the function  @xmath11 is called the _ size _ of the kernel and may be viewed as a measure of the `` compressibility '' of a problem using polynomial - time preprocessing rules . a natural problem in this context is to find polynomial or linear kernels for problems that admit such kernelization algorithms .",
    "a celebrated result in this area is the linear kernel for dominating set on planar graphs by alber _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , which gave rise to an explosion of ( meta-)results on linear kernels on planar graphs  @xcite and other sparse graph classes  @xcite .",
    "although of great theoretical importance , these meta - theorems have two important drawbacks from a practical point of view . on the one hand , these results rely on a problem property called _ finite integer index _ , which guarantees the _ existence _ of a linear kernel , but nowadays it is still not clear how and when such a kernel can be effectively _",
    "constructed_. on the other hand , at the price of generality one can not hope that general results of this type may directly provide explicit reduction rules and small constants for particular graph problems .",
    "summarizing , as mentioned explicitly by bodlaender _",

    "it is worth mentioning that rbdsplays an important role in the theory of non - existence of polynomial kernels for parameterized problems  @xcite .",
    "the fact that rbdsinvolves a _ coloring _ of the vertices of the input graph makes it unclear how to make the problem fit into the general frameworks of  @xcite . in this article",
    "we provide the first explicit ( and quite simple ) polynomial - time data reduction rules for red - blue dominating set on planar graphs , which lead to a linear kernel for the problem .",
    "[ th : main ] red - blue dominating set parameterized by the solution size has a linear kernel on planar graphs .",
    "more precisely , there exists a polynomial - time algorithm that for each planar instance @xmath14 , either correctly reports that @xmath14 is a no - instance , or returns an equivalence instance @xmath15 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this result complements several explicit linear kernels on planar graphs for other domination problems such as dominating set  @xcite , edge dominating set  @xcite , efficient dominating set  @xcite , connected dominating set  @xcite , or total dominating set  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our constant is considerably smaller than most of the constants provided by these results .",
    "since one can easily reduce the face cover problem on a planar graph to rbds(without changing the parameter ) and its dual @xmath18 , and color the vertices of @xmath2 ( resp .",

    "the best existing kernel for face cover is quadratic  @xcite .",
    "our techniques are much inspired by those of alber  _ et al_.  @xcite for dominating set , although our reduction rules and analysis are slightly simpler .",
    "we start by describing in section  [ sec : redrules ] our reduction rules for red - blue dominating set when the input graph is embedded in the plane , and in section  [ sec : analysis ] we prove that the size of a reduced plane yes - instance is linear in the size of the desired red - blue dominating set , thus proving theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with some directions for further research in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section we propose reduction rules for red - blue dominating set , which are largely inspired by the rules that yielded the first linear kernel for dominating seton planar graphs  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to either replace the neighborhood of some blue vertices by appropriate gadgets , or to remove some blue vertices and their neighborhood when we can assume that these blue vertices belong to the dominating set .",
    "we would like to point out that our rules have also some points in common with the ones for the current best kernel for dominating set  @xcite . in subsection  [ elementary ] we present two easy elementary rules that turn out to be helpful in simplifying the instance , and then in subsections  [ rsom ] and  [ rpair ] we present the rules for a single vertex and a pair of vertices , respectively .",

    "moreover , @xmath272 , since the unique dominating vertex should have been removed by rule  [ rgl_som ] . also , @xmath273 , since the pair of dominating vertices should have been removed by rule  [ rgl_pair ] .",
