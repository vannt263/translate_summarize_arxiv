    "however in the paper @xcite , a coherent quantum control problem is considered in which both field coupling and direct coupling is considered between the quantum plant and the quantum controller . in this paper , we explore the construction of a coherent quantum observer in which there is only direct coupling between quantum plant and the quantum observer . furthermore ,",
    "both the quantum plant and the quantum observer are assumed to be closed quantum systems which means that they are not subject to quantum noise and are purely deterministic systems .",
    "this leads to an observer structure of the form shown in figure [ f2 ] .",

    "this will be an essentially random value .",
    "if at a later time an observer with the same parameters as above is connected to the quantum plant , then time average of its output @xmath140 will again converge to @xmath146 and @xmath142 will remain constant at @xmath145 .",
