    "the interest in the stationary behavior of hidden markov models dates back at least to a 1957 paper by blackwell @xcite , who was motivated by the following problem from information theory .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a stationary markov chain which takes values in a finite set .",
    "the entropy rate of such a chain admits a simple expression in terms of its transition probabilities and stationary distribution .",
    "the purpose of the paper by blackwell was to obtain a similar expression for the entropy rate of the stochastic process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a noninvertible function .",
    "the latter expression does not involve directly the stationary distribution of the process @xmath3 , but rather a particular stationary distribution of the associated filtering process @xmath4 , which is a measure - valued markov process defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the result of blackwell raises a natural question : does the filtering process possess a unique stationary measure or , in other words , is the filtering process _",
    "uniquely ergodic _ ?",
    "blackwell conjectured that the filter is uniquely ergodic , provided that the underlying markov chain @xmath3 is irreducible .",
    "however , as is pointed out by kaijser @xcite , one of blackwell s own counterexamples demonstrates that this conjecture is incorrect .",
    "the problem of finding a complete characterization of the unique ergodicity of the filtering process has hitherto remained open .",
    "the present paper provides one solution to this problem ( in a more general setting ) .      to our knowledge , the only direct contributions to the problem studied in this paper are contained in blackwell s 1957 paper @xcite , in a 1975 paper by kaijser @xcite and in two recent papers by kochman and reeds @xcite and by kaijser @xcite , which we presently review .    in the 1975 paper @xcite",
    ", kaijser observes that the filtering process can be expressed as the ratio of two quantities which are defined in terms of products of random matrices .",
    "therefore , the unique ergodicity problem can be studied by means of the furstenberg  kesten theory of random matrix products .",
    "such an analysis leads kaijser to introduce a certain subrectangularity condition on the matrices that define the filter [ condition [ condk ] in section [ sec : kaijser ] ] .",
    "this rather strong condition is sufficient , but not necessary for unique ergodicity .",
    "it should be noted that blackwell s original paper @xcite already gives a sufficient condition for unique ergodicity , which is , however , even stronger than kaijser s subrectangularity condition .    in their 2006 paper @xcite , kochman and reeds",
    "introduce a weaker sufficient condition for unique ergodicity of the filter , which requires that the closure of a certain cone of matrices contains an element of rank one [ condition [ condkr ] in section [ sec : mr ] ] .",
    "kochman and reeds demonstrate by means of an explicit computation that kaijser s condition implies the rank one condition , but a counterexample shows that the latter condition is strictly weaker . besides providing a generalization of kaijser s result , kochman and reeds employ a different method of proof that is based on a general result in the ergodic theory of markov chains in topological state spaces ( which is applied to the filtering process ) .",
    "finally , in a recent paper @xcite , kaijser presents an extension of the result of kochman and reeds to hidden markov models where the underlying markov chain @xmath3 takes values in a countable state space .",
    "( it should be noted that kochman and reeds , as well as kaijser , admit a more general observation structure than in blackwell s original problem . )",
    "the extension is far from straightforward , as the ergodic theory employed by kochman and reeds is restricted to markov chains in locally compact state spaces , while the space of probability measures on a countable set is certainly not locally compact .",
    "a large part of this lengthy paper is taken up with the development of a rather specialized ergodic theorem for markov chains in polish spaces , from which a condition similar in spirit to kochman and reeds rank one condition [ condition [ condb1 ] in section [ sec : kaijser ] ] can be derived .",
    "independently from blackwell s unique ergodicity problem , a general study of the ergodic theory of nonlinear filtering processes was initiated in the seminal 1971 paper of kunita @xcite .",
    "kunita studies a somewhat different problem , in continuous time and with white noise type observations , but which otherwise bears strong similarities to the problem studied by blackwell .",
    "in contrast to the approaches developed by kaijser , kochman and reeds , who study the _ equations _ that define the filter using general methods ( products of random matrices and ergodic theory of markov chains ) , kunita studies the nonlinear filter directly through its characterization as a conditional expectation ( an approach we called _ intrinsic _ in @xcite ) .",
    "the techniques developed by kunita are in fact extremely general and can be applied also to blackwell s problem , though this approach has not previously been systematically exploited .",
    "kunita characterizes the invariant measures of the filtering process by means of the convex ordering .",
    "when the signal @xmath3 is uniquely ergodic , all invariant measures of the filter are sandwiched between two distinguished invariant measures which are minimal and maximal with respect to the convex order , respectively ( see remark [ rem : explkunita ] below for a more precise statement ) .",
    "the filter is uniquely ergodic precisely when the minimal and maximal invariant measures coincide .",
    "the main result of kunita s paper claims that this is always the case , when the signal is ergodic in a certain sense .",
    "unfortunately , the proof of this result contains a serious gap @xcite ; indeed , the correctness of the proof is already contradicted by the counterexample given in kaijser @xcite ( see @xcite for extensive discussion ) .    the gap in kunita s main result is now largely resolved @xcite , but under an additional _ nondegeneracy _ assumption on the observation structure [ condition  [ condn ] of section [ sec : kaijser ] in the present setting ] .",
    "this assumption holds , for example , if @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an independent gaussian random variable and @xmath8 is an arbitrarily small noise strength , but breaks down in the noiseless case @xmath9 .",
    "the nondegeneracy assumption evidently captures the phenomenon that observation noise has a stabilizing effect on the filter , as is the case in a large number of interesting applications .",
    "unfortunately , it is the degenerate case that is chiefly of interest in blackwell s problem , and unique ergodicity turns out to be more delicate in this setting as is demonstrated by various counterexamples @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the somewhat different problem of _ filter stability _ ( see the survey @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the filtering process is called stable if @xmath10 becomes independent of its initial condition @xmath11 as @xmath12 in a certain pathwise sense ( e.g. , as in theorem [ thm : kunita ] ) . however , it is now well established that when the signal @xmath3 is ergodic , filter stability and unique ergodicity of the filter are essentially equivalent properties @xcite . in the present setting , this has two important consequences .",
    "first , filter stability can be used as a tool to study unique ergodicity of the filter , a fact that is heavily exploited in this paper .",
    "second , previous work on the filter stability problem provides a set of sufficient conditions for blackwell s unique ergodicity problem which are distinct from those proposed by kaijser , kochman and reeds .",
    "the present paper was inspired by the observation that the conditions of kochman and reeds @xcite and kaijser @xcite are reminiscent of the filter stability property , albeit along a single sample path .",
    "it is therefore a natural step to make the connection with filter stability theory and kunita s ergodic theory .",
    "our results demonstrate that this approach is both natural and fruitful .",
    "our first main result , theorem [ thm : mainc ] , establishes that a certain condition [ condc ] is necessary and sufficient for unique ergodicity of the filter in the case where @xmath13 and @xmath14 both take values in an ( at most ) countable state space .",
    "it is easily shown , as we do in section [ sec : kaijser ] , that the sufficient conditions given in kaijser s recent paper @xcite imply condition [ condc ] .",
    "it should be noted that the proof of theorem [ thm : mainc ] is surprisingly easy and natural  that is , provided the connection between filter stability and kunita s ergodic theory ( given in theorem [ thm : kunita ] ) is taken for granted .",
    "our second main result , theorem [ thm : mainf ] , shows that the rank one condition [ condkr ] of kochman and reeds is necessary and sufficient for unique ergodicity of the filter in the case where @xmath13 takes values in a finite state space .",
    "sufficiency was already proved by kochman and reeds @xcite , though we give here an entirely different proof of this fact by showing that condition [ condkr ] implies condition [ condc ] .",
    "the necessity of condition [ condkr ] is new , and answers in the affirmative the question posed on the last page of @xcite .",
    "thus the necessity and sufficiency of condition  [ condkr ] provides a complete solution to the original problem posed by blackwell @xcite .",
    "our main results subsume all of the sufficient conditions introduced in the papers of kaijser , kochman and reeds .",
    "in addition , we discuss in section [ sec : kaijser ] some sufficient conditions of a different nature which are inherited from results in the filter stability literature .",
    "though these conditions are not necessary , they may be substantially easier to check in practice than condition [ condc ] or [ condkr ] .",
    "moreover , such conditions remain of independent interest , as we were not able to verify by an explicit computation that they imply condition [ condc ] or [ condkr ] ( of course , this implication follows indirectly from the necessity of these conditions ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prelim ] we introduce the basic hidden markov model , and we fix once and for all the notation and standing assumptions that are presumed to be in force throughout the paper .",
    "we also state our main results , theorems [ thm : mainc ] and  [ thm : mainf ] . in section",
    "[ sec : ergodic ] , we introduce the connection between filter stability and unique ergodicity of the filter .",
    "the main result of this section , theorem [ thm : kunita ] , adapts the necessary theory to the setting of this paper and forms the foundation for the proofs of our main results .",
    "section [ sec : mainc ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm : mainc ] , while section [ sec : mainf ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm : mainf ] .",
    "section [ sec : kaijser ] develops various sufficient conditions for unique ergodicity within the setting of this paper .",
    "finally , the is devoted to the proofs of various results that were omitted from the body of the paper .",
    "throughout this paper , we operate in the following setup . we consider the stochastic process @xmath15 , where @xmath13 takes values in the state space @xmath16 , and @xmath14 takes values in the state space  @xmath17 .",
    "we will always presume that the following assumptions are in force :    * @xmath16 is either finite ( @xmath18 ) or countable ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "* @xmath17 is a polish space [ endowed with its borel @xmath20-field @xmath21 .",
    "we realize the stochastic process @xmath15 on the canonical path space @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "denote by @xmath27 the borel @xmath20-field on @xmath28 , and introduce the @xmath20-fields @xmath29\\},\\qquad \\mathcal{f}_{m , n}^y = \\sigma\\{y_k\\dvtx k\\in[m , n]\\}\\ ] ] for @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath20-fields @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc . , are defined in the usual fashion ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) . for future reference",
    ", we define @xmath35 ( note that @xmath36 , a fact that will be used frequently in the following ) . finally , the shift @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "we now define a probability measure on @xmath39 under which @xmath40 is a _ hidden markov model_. our model is specified by the following ingredients :    1 .",
    "a @xmath20-finite reference measure @xmath41 on @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   a nonnegative matrix function @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and such that the matrix @xmath44 defines the transition matrix of an irreducible and positive recurrent ( but not necessarily aperiodic ) markov chain in the state space @xmath16 .    as @xmath45 is irreducible and positive recurrent ,",
    "there is a unique probability measure @xmath46 on @xmath16 that is invariant @xmath47 ( as is usual , we identify measures and functions on a countable space with row and column vectors , respectively ) .",
    "a standard extension argument allows us to construct a probability measure @xmath48 on @xmath39 under which @xmath40 is a stationary markov chain with transition probabilities @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "it should be noted that under @xmath48 , the process @xmath53 is a stationary markov chain with transition matrix @xmath45 , and @xmath54 are conditionally independent given @xmath53 .",
    "this is precisely the defining property of a hidden markov model .",
    "the process @xmath53 represents an unobserved or `` hidden '' signal process , while @xmath54 is the observation process .",
    "the canonical probability space @xmath55 thus constructed will remain fixed throughout the paper .",
    "a hidden markov model is often assumed to satisfy the additional assumption that @xmath56 is a ( noisy ) function of @xmath57 only . in this case",
    ", one can factor @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the density of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath41 . in the present setting ,",
    "the conditional law of @xmath56 can depend on both @xmath57 and @xmath61 .",
    "the generalization afforded by this model is minor , but allows us to include the partitioned transition matrices of @xcite as a special case .    the boundedness condition @xmath62 a.e .",
    "is automatically satisfied in the following cases :    * when @xmath16 is a finite set , the condition holds trivially .",
    "* when @xmath16 is countable and @xmath17 is at most countable , the condition always holds .",
    "indeed , note that in this case @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 for @xmath41-a.e .",
    "@xmath51 .",
    "the significance of this assumption is that it ensures the feller property of the filter .    for any polish space @xmath65",
    "we denote by @xmath66 the borel @xmath20-field of @xmath65 , by @xmath67 the space of probability measures on @xmath65 , and by @xmath68 the space of bounded continuous functions on @xmath65 .",
    "we will always endow @xmath67 with the topology of weak convergence of probability measures [ recall that @xmath67 is then itself polish ] , and we write @xmath69 if the sequence @xmath70 converges weakly to @xmath71 . the total variation distance between probability measures",
    "@xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 finally , let us recall that as @xmath16 is at most countable and @xmath45 is irreducible , the invariant measure @xmath46 must charge every point of @xmath16 .",

    "we will encounter several variants of the nonlinear filter , defined as follows : @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath75 , @xmath80 ( here @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
