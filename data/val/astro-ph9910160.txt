    "although the gas content of host galaxies is generally enough to fuel agns over the hubble time , the mechanism responsible for transporting gas from the kpc scale into the nuclear region is still unclear .",
    "indeed , the galactic gas must lose about 99.9% of its angular momentum before reaching the central few parsecs , where viscosity can be effective .",
    "the required accretion rates are lower in seyfert galaxies than in qsos and the gas inflow requirements from the host galaxy are relaxed . however , because of the large number of seyfert galaxies ( @xmath7 10% ) in the local universe and the even larger fraction of agns at high redshifts ( ho et al .",

    "1998 , miyaji et al . 1999 ) , some mechanism for transporting gas from the circumnuclear 100 pc into the central parsec is still required to maintain the activity of these nuclei .",
    "also , the accumulation of large quantities of gas in the innermost region of seyfert nuclei is inferred from the observation that most of them are obscured by gaseous column densities in excess of @xmath8 within the central 10 pc ( risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ) and from the detection of maser emission within the nuclear few parsecs ( greenhill et al .",

    "however , within the central few hundred parsecs large scale disturbances have little effect in removing angular momentum from the gas , since on these scales the gravitational field is dominated by the central region of the bulge that is axially symmetric . nested",
    ", secondary stellar bars have been observed in several barred system ( jungwiert et al .",
    "1997 , friedli et al .",
    "1996 , wozniak et al .",
    "these secondary bars are relatively small ( a few 100 pc long ) and could be responsible for transporting gas into the nuclear region to feed a black hole . indeed , the fraction of seyfert nuclei among the 40 double - barred systems known so far is about 1/3 to be compared to the fraction of seyferts among all galaxies that is about 1/10 ( friedli 1999 ) . alternatively , shlosman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , wada & habe ( 1992 ) and heller & shlosman ( 1994 ) proposed that if the mass of gas gathered into the central region exceeds about 10% of the dynamical mass then the gaseous disk develops gravitational instabilities and forms a gaseous bar , which can drive gas further into the nuclear region . indeed , there is evidence in several seyfert nuclei for concentrations of gas whose mass approaches the dynamical mass ( meixner et al .",
    "1990 , henkel et al .",
    "1991 , risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ) , therefore gaseous bars are expected to form and to provide a mechanisms for the fuelling of the nuclear region .",
    "however , neither of these mechanisms appear to operate in the majority of seyfert galaxies .    understanding the mechanism responsible for the fuelling of active galaxies is also relevant to other issues . the dense gas funneled into the central region is photoionized by uv radiation from the nuclear source and/or is shock excited by the interaction with radio jets .",
    "also , the large mass of gas driven into the central region and the perturbations due to the fuelling mechanism are expected to boost the star forming activity in the central region .",
    "therefore , the fuelling mechanism of agns is likely to play a key role in the connection between starbursts and agns ( gonzalez - delgado et al .",

    "the plate scales for cameras nic2 and nic3 are 0.076``/pixel and 0.204''/pixel respectively .",
    "the reduction of the nicmos images used routines from the package nicred ( mcleod 1997 ) .",
    "a master dark image was produced by combining between 10 and 20 darks for a given sample sequence after the subtraction of the first readout .",
    "the darks were taken from other programs carried out close in time .",

    "rodger thompson . only for the nic2 f187n and nic2 f190n filters were in - flight flats not available , so thermal - vacuum flatfields were used instead .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the following steps : subtraction of the first readout ; dark current subtraction on a read - by - read basis ; correction for linearity and cosmic ray rejection ( using the _ fullfit _ routine in nicred ) ; and flatfielding .",
    "the individual dithered galaxy images were registered to a common position using fractional pixel offsets and a cubic spline interpolation , and combined to produce the final image of each field . since our nicmos images were obtained after august 1997 , no correction for the pedestal effect was necessary .    prior to flux calibrating the images , the background needs to be subtracted from the images ( this is important only for filters at wavelengths longer than 2@xmath15 m ) . due to the large projected size of circinus ,",
    "the field of view of the nic2 images is not large enough to allow measurements of the background on blank corners of the images , so we used background measurements taken during the servicing mission observatory verification ( smov ) program for the filter nic2 f222 m , and from our observations of the interacting galaxy arp  299 for the nic2 f160w filter .",
    "the nic3 mosaics cover a larger field of view , and an estimate of the thermal background was obtained from the corners of the images .",
    "the flux calibration of the broad - band , on - line , and off - line images was performed using conversion factors ( from adu / s to mjy ) from measurements of the standard star p330-e during smov .",
    "nicmos only provides continuum bands to the red of the emission lines .",
    "the extinction in the nuclear regions of circinus is very high ( even at infrared wavelengths ) , and a straight subtraction of the longer wavelength off - line image results in an overcorrection of the continuum at the wavelength of the emission line . to estimate the continuum at @xmath16 m , @xmath17 m , @xmath18 m and @xmath19 m for the nic3 f164n , nic3 f196n and nic3 212n respectively , we fit the continuum between @xmath20 m and @xmath21 m using the nic3 f166n and nic3 f200n line - free images for the first two , and the nic3 f200n and nic3 f215n for the last image .",
    "the same procedure was followed to subtract the continuum at @xmath19 m for the nic2 f187n image , using the nic2 f160w and f222 m images .",
    "the continuum fit is simply a linear regression of the flux as a function of the wavelength for each point in the image .",
    "an image at the required continuum wavelength is then constructed by extrapolation or interpolation of the corresponding fit .",
    "the extrapolated continuum is subtracted from the line+continuum images to produce the final [ feii]@xmath16 m , pa@xmath3 , [ sivi]@xmath17 m and h@xmath1 at @xmath22 m images . due to the low surface brightness of the h@xmath1 emission together with problems associated with the continuum subtraction , the resulting h@xmath1 image had relatively low signal to noise , and therefore we used the h@xmath1 map obtained with the 3d integral field spectrometer ( see next section ) .",

    "however , as discussed in the next section , the velocity field of the molecular gas strongly deviates from circular motion , ruling out this interpretation .",
    "the northern extremity of the gaseous bar ends in a dusty feature that resembles a circumnuclear disk , about 20 pc in radius .",
    "only the near side of this disk - like feature is clearly delineated , possibly as a consequence its being seen in absorption ( as for the bar ) and therefore the contrast is expected to be much higher on the near side . according to models , the gaseous bar is expected to form a gaseous disk in its central part during the latest stages of its evolution as a consequence of cloud - cloud viscous collisions at the denser regions near the aphelia of the orbits ( wada & habe 1992 ) .",

    "the velocity field of the central region ( 2040 pc ) is however dominated by a normal rotation pattern : here the isovelocity lines are parallel to the minor axis . this nuclear rotation might be associated with the disk - like feature observed in the h ",

    "the general behavior of the kinematics can be ascribed to streaming motions due to the gaseous bar .",

    "higher angular and spectral resolution and a more detailed modelling of the gas kinematics in this region are required to further support our findings and/or provide new insights on the details of the gas dynamics .",
    "the gas inflow through the bar not only brings material close to the nuclear black hole , but probably plays an important role also in other phenomena of the nuclear activity such as the ionization cones and the star formation .",
    "7a shows the nicmos map of the [ sivi ] coronal emission line .",
    "the [ sivi ] emission extends in the ionization cone traced by the [ oiii ] optical images ( marconi et al .",

    "the presence of [ sivi ] emission also on the eastern side of the nucleus provides evidence for a counter - cone , whose existence was also inferred from the larger scale radio maps ( elmouttie et al .",
    "1995 , 1998c ) .",
    "the foreground extinction due to the nuclear dusty feature ( disk ? ) is very likely responsible for the reduced [ sivi ] brightness of the counter cone . if the nuclear dusty feature produces an extinction of a@xmath69 mag ( as inferred from fig .",
    "1b ) , this would imply a@xmath70}\\sim 1.1 $ ] , fully accounting for the brightness difference between the two cones , about a factor of 3 .",
    "the [ sivi ] emission is not azimuthally uniform within the ( nw ) ionization cone ; the southern edge appears much brighter than the rest .",
    "it is likely that the gas transported by the bar enters the ionization cone in this region .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the distribution of the molecular gas shown in figs . 7 _ a _ and _ b _ , where we report the 3d maps of the integrated h@xmath1s(1)(10 ) emission line and the highest velocity component of the gas traced by this line .",
    "these maps show the presence of large quantities of gas just south of the ionization cone , that is flowing at high velocities towards the southern edge of the ionization cone .",
    "next to the edge of the cone the h@xmath1 emission is highest because here the molecular gas is more exposed to the nuclear radiation , but also because the gas density is high and the h@xmath1 has not had time to dissociate fully .",
    "indeed , the r ",
    "h color map ( fig .",
    "3 ) clearly shows a prominent dust lane extending along the southern edge of the ionization cone , coincident with the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "as soon as these dense clouds enter the ionization cone they are ionized and emit the [ sivi ] line , but also pa@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "7c ) ; this gas is very dense and therefore the ionized gas emission is very high .",
    "another dust lane in fig .",
    "3 traces the northern edge of the ionization cone .",
    "another possible explanation of the emission line and dust lane morphology is that these features are simply the effect of the orientation of the ionization cone with respect the nuclear part of the galactic gaseous disk , which might be warped on these small scales ( quillen et al .",
    "1999 , mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 , schreier et al .",
    "the brighter part of the ionization cone might correspond to the region closer to denser gas of such nuclear disk .",
    "the only difficulty with this model is to obtain a projected velocity in excess of 200 km / s , as observed in fig . 7a .    as shown in figs .",
    "7 _ a _ and _ b _ the molecular clouds enter the ionization cone very close ( @xmath71 pc ) to the nucleus , where the radiation pressure is very high . as discussed in binette ( 1998 ) the radiative acceleration is given by @xmath72 $ ] , where _ n _ is the gas numerical density , @xmath73 is the ionization parameter and @xmath74 the dust content with respect to the solar value .",
    "the density of the coronal line region was estimated to be about 5000 @xmath75 based on the infrared [ nev ] doublet ( moorwood et al .",
    "oliva et al . ( 1999 ) determined @xmath73 for a single cloud in the ionization cone ; we scaled this value to the distance of 10 pc and to the density of 5000 @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 . with these values @xmath77 for a dust content of @xmath78 .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) set an upper limit to the mass of a nuclear black hole in circinus of @xmath79 .",
    "the gravitational pull at a distance of 10 pc is estimated to be @xmath80 , i.e. about one order of magnitude lower than the radiative acceleration .",
    "therefore , these clouds just driven into the ionization cone will be pushed outward to form an outflowing component of the coronal line region and of the nlr .",
    "this outward acceleration of the coronal line clouds , as well as the tendency of the clouds to be ablated under the strong radiation pressure ( mathews 1986 ) , is probably responsible for the lower emissivity of the [ sivi ] line in the northern part of the cone .",
    "the denser clouds injected into the cone will survive ablation and will be accelerated like `` bullets '' .",
    "veilleux & bland - hawthorn ( 1997 ) discovered the presence of supersonically ejected clouds ( @xmath81 ) in the circinus nlr , which they ascribe to some explosive nuclear event .",
    "we claim that such ejected `` bullets '' are the result of the radiative acceleration of the dense clouds that have been driven into the ionization cone by the gaseous bar or by the nuclear disk . as suggested by binette ( 1998 )",
    ", the radiation pressure  driven outflow would explain the blueshift of the coronal lines observed in circinus ( oliva et al .",
    "1994 ) and in other seyfert galaxies ( penston et al .",
    "1984 ) , as well as the dependence of the blueward asymmetry of the narrow lines on the ionization potential and on critical density ( derobertis & shaw 1990 , dahari & de robertis 1988 , whittle 1992 , heckman et al . 1981 ) .",
    "a potential problem of the `` outflow model '' would be that new gas must be continuously supplied to the inner part of the cone to replace the outflowing gas .",
    "the gas flow provided by the gaseous bar or by the nuclear disk could to be the mechanism responsible for feeding the inner part of the ionization cone ( a more quantitative discussion is given in sect.[fuel_cone ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , a large fraction of the gas in the outer regions of the nlr ( 100 pc scale ) , characterized by lower ionization emission species , is probably part of the normal galaxy disk illuminated by the nuclear source .",
    "indeed , the kinematics of the outer parts of the ionization cone are also characterized by a rotational component ( elmouttie et al .",
    "1998b , veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ) .",
    "+      another interesting feature of the emission line maps in fig .  7 is that both the [ sivi ] and [ feii ] lines peak on the nucleus : although both show extended emission , a large fraction of the integrated flux ( @xmath7 70% for [ sivi ] ) comes from an unresolved source coincident with the 2.2@xmath15 m continuum peak , i.e. the location of the active nucleus .",
    "the shift of the [ sivi ] peak observed in the lower resolution data of maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was due to a blend of the nuclear component with the extended component to the west .",
    "although , a fraction of the coronal lines might be excited by shocks , most of the coronal line emission must be ascribed to photoionization ( oliva 1997 ) . however , according to photoionization models , the [ sivi ] is expected to peak at the outer edge of the he@xmath82 strmgren sphere , while the [ feii ] should peak right after the h@xmath83 strmgren sphere . with the luminosity of circinus and a density of 10@xmath84 @xmath75",
    "( i.e. even higher than what is estimated through the [ nev ] infrared lines ) oliva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) derived that the [ sivi ] should peak at about 30 pc from the nucleus .",
    "the [ feii ] emission should peak even further out .",
    "there are a few possible explanations of this inconsistency :    1 .   as suggested by oliva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the ionized clouds are dusty .",
    "the ionization parameter in these regions is very high ( u@xmath85 ) and , therefore , the dust competes with the gas in absorbing uv photons thus reducing significantly the size of the strmgren spheres .",
    "this might be the case for the [ feii ] emission . yet",
    "the clouds responsible for the emission of most coronal lines ( including [ sivi ] ) appear characterized by little dust content and , therefore , dust probably plays a minor role in the ionization structure of these clouds .",
    "another possibility is that the gas that emits most of the coronal lines is significantly denser , shrinking the size of the he@xmath82 sphere .",
    "more specifically @xmath86 .",
    "reducing the radius of the [ sivi ] emitting shell from 30 pc to less than 10 pc ( which would make the emission unresolved ) would require an electron density larger by a factor of 5 , i.e. @xmath87 . however , this density is one order of magnitude higher than what measured from the [ nev ] doublet ( moorwood et al .",
    "1996 ) . also , the thickness of the [ sivi ] emitting shell ( marconi et al .",
    "1994b ) , relative to @xmath88 , is inversely proportional to n@xmath89 and , therefore , the [ sivi ] line would be significantly fainter than other coronal lines that form inside the he@xmath82 sphere , i.e. higher ionization species .",
    "this line of reasoning applies as long as the ionization structure has a quasi - spherical geometry ( oliva 1997 ) .",
    "if a nuclear population of very dense clouds exists , more specifically with @xmath90 ( but still lower than the critical density of @xmath91 ) , then the geometry of the ionization structure is quasi - plane parallel ( @xmath92 ) and the region of [ sivi ] emission extends over the whole he@xmath82 strmgren region .",
    "this would solve the problem of the ratio between [ sivi ] and the higher ionization coronal lines , but the lower density measured with the [ nev ] lines remains an issue .",
    "3 .   increasing the filling factor",
    "would also reduce the size of the emission region ( @xmath93 ) , but this would also affect the coronal line ratios similarly to the change in density discussed above .",
    "4 .   a final",
    ", interesting possibility is that the nuclear uv emission is intrinsically non  isotropic ( oliva et al .",
    "1999 ) , as is expected to be the case if the emission arises from an optically thick accretion disk . in the latter case",
    "the azimuthal clouds are illuminated by a flux that is significantly lower than the face - on flux ( l@xmath94 , laor & netzer 1989 ) .",
    "the he@xmath82 strmgren radius of the azimuthally distributed gas would be much smaller than that estimated above and could very well appear point like at our resolution .",
    "the pa@xmath3 and the [ feii ] emission appear much more diffuse and extended morphology observed in our nicmos image is consistent with the lower resolution map obtained by davies et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . ] than the [ sivi ] .",
    "both emission lines extend well outside the ionization cone and preferentially along the major axis of the galaxy , although the pa@xmath3 also has a component in the ionization cone similar to that observed in the [ sivi ] map . very likely",
    "the diffuse / extended emission traces moderate star forming activity occurring within the central 50 pc as a result of the large amount of molecular gas driven into this region by the gaseous bar .",
    "the pa@xmath3 emission traces the uv radiation from young ob stars .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the circumnuclear br@xmath38 emission and the mass - to - light ratio to model the star formation history , and infer that the nuclear stellar population has an age of about 10@xmath14 yr .    fig .",
    "7c shows that the star formation history of the nuclear region is probably more complex .",
    "the pa@xmath3 map shows the presence of knots and non - axisymmetric emission : a chain of three hii region is present at about 20 pc to the north - east of the nucleus , while a burst of star formation is present to the south - west , right at the nuclear end of the leading side of the gaseous bar .",
    "these are the locations of the aphelia of the bar , where orbit crowding is indeed expected to enhance the star formation ( wada and habe 1992 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for star forming activity along the bar .",
    "although large concentrations of gas are expected along the leading side of the bar , star formation might be inhibited by the strong shear forces ( elmegreen 1979 , kenney & lord 1991 ) .",
    "the diffuse [ feii ] emission probably traces gas shocked by supernova explosions . a bright [ feii ] knot",
    ", about 30 pc to the north of the nucleus very likely traces a single young supernova remnant .",
    "the [ feii ] knot is unresolved ( i.e. r@xmath95 4 pc ) , thus implying that the snr must be younger than about 100 yr . there is also a prominent [ feii ] extension to the south of the nucleus , slightly offset with respect to the pa@xmath3 emission ; shocks due to the gas streaming from the gaseous bar might also play a role in this region .",
    "although the presence of a nuclear gas bar appears convincing both from the morphological and the kinematical points of view , we can check whether the physical conditions of the gas meet the requirements necessary to develop the gravitational instabilities that should form a bar . according to models ,",
    "a gaseous bar should form when the mass of the gaseous nuclear disk is larger than 10 ( wada & habe 1992 ) to 20% ( shlosman et al .",
    "1989 ) , of the dynamical mass .",
    "co(21 ) millimetric data",
    "( aalto et al .",
    "1995 , johansson et al .",
    "1991 ) indicate that the gas mass enclosed within the central 400 pc is about @xmath96 , if the galactic conversion factor is assumed ( kenney & young 1989 ) . based on the kinematical information provided by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we estimate that the dynamical mass inside the same region is about @xmath97 , i.e. only a factor of two higher than the mass in molecular gas . therefore , the physical conditions of the gas in the nuclear region are indeed appropriate for the formation of a gaseous bar ( although this argument is weakened if the conversion from co to gas mass is less than the standard galactic value , as sometimes appears to be the case in extreme starbursts ) .    in the h ",
    "k color map ( fig .",
    "1b ) only one side of the gaseous bar is observed ; the north ",
    "west counterpart is not seen .",
    "one possible explanation is that the other side of the gaseous bar is present but it is not observed in the extinction map because the contrast of absorption features is much lower on the far side of the disk ( more foreground stars and less stars behind ) .",
    "otherwise the north - west side of the bar might be intrinsically weaker or even absent .",
    "since gaseous bars are formed via gravitational instabilities , they are expected to be highly inhomogeneous and possibly asymmetric , especially on such small scales .",
    "another important issue to address is whether these gaseous bars are rare cases or they could be a fuelling mechanism common to most active galaxies as claimed by shlosman et al .",
    "if the latter is the case then the question is why such nuclear gaseous bars were detected only in a few active nuclei ( mulchaey & regan 1999 , henkel et al .",
    "1991 , ishizuki et al .",
    "1990 ) , or none if we only consider nuclear bars as small as the one in circinus .",
    "these gaseous bars can be identified from molecular gas emission ( eg . co millimetric maps ) and/or through dust absorption traced by the color maps , as we have done in this work .",
    "circinus is closest seyfert 2 known and the projected angular size of the gaseous bar is 2 arcsec .",
    "most of the other seyfert galaxies are further away and , therefore , a nuclear gaseous bar with similar size would have a much smaller angular size , which would make it hard to detect .",
    "the average distance of the seyfert galaxies in the sample of maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) is 32 mpc and the projected size of the nuclear gaseous bar would be a few tenths of arcsecond , unresolved even at the nicmos resolution ( at 2 @xmath15 m ) and at the resolution of the current millimetric interferometers .",
    "also , we emphasize that the color map technique to search for gaseous bars works as long as infrared filters are used . in these heavily obscured nuclei the optical images sample only the outer ( foreground ) parts of the nuclear region and therefore do not provide the required information even if compared with an infrared image to obtain a color map . indeed , as shown in fig .  3 and as discussed in sect.3.1 , the r ",
    "h color map of circinus does not show evidence for the dusty bar detected in the h ",
    "k color map .",
    "this result may partly explain the shortage of gaseous bars in regan & muchaey ( 1999 ) , a work which included images taken through the above filters of a sample of seyferts .",
    "summarizing , whether nuclear gas bars are a common feature in seyfert galaxies or not remains an open question , since such structures might have been missed in previous studies both because of limited angular resolution and/or inappropriate techniques .      as discussed in athanassoula ( 1992 ) and regan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , probably only a small fraction of the streaming gas does actually result in an inflow ( 10%30% ) . we can estimate the streaming flux of the gas along the leading edge of the nuclear bar in circinus and compare it with the inflow requirements to feed the active nucleus . the gas streaming flow along the leading edge of the bar ( an upper limit to the real inflow rate ) is given by :    @xmath98    [ m_stream ]    where w is the width of the streaming gas lane ( @xmath7 20 pc ) , m@xmath99 is the proton mass , @xmath100 is the streaming gas velocity along the leading edge of the gaseous bar and @xmath101 the gas column density in the same region ( @xmath102 , sect.[nic_bar ] ) . to determine @xmath100 we have to correct the observed redshifted velocity for various projection effects and for the contribution due to the pattern circular motion , as illustrated in fig .  2 . more specifically : @xmath103 [ v_stream ] where v@xmath104 is the doppler velocity shift observed along the leading edge of the bar , @xmath105 is the deprojected angle between the galaxy minor axis and the line connecting the nucleus to the specific point along the leading edge of the bar where the redshifted gas is observed ( see fig .  2 ) , v@xmath106 is the velocity component due to pattern speed at the same location , while _ i _ and @xmath3 were defined in sect.[nic_bar ] .",
    "the outer edge of the gaseous bar is located at about 160 pc from the nucleus , probably the location of the corotation radius . at this distance",
    "the rotational velocity is 150 km / s ( deprojected for inclination , maiolino et al .",

    "the streaming flow estimated above is 25 times higher than the agn accretion rate .",
    "therefore even if only 10% of the streaming gas actually flows into the nucleus , this will provide 2.5 times as much fuel as required to power the activity .",
    "as discussed above , pa@xmath3 emission traces regions of recent star formation , while the smoother near - ir continuum emission traces the older stellar population evolved from past bursts .",
    "we can estimate the current star formation rate from the pa@xmath3 emission due to stellar activity integrated in the nuclear region .",
    "we subtracted the contribution to the pa@xmath3 emission due to the active nucleus by normalizing the [ sivi ] map to the pa@xmath3 on the nucleus ; this is actually a conservative subtraction of the agn pa@xmath3 flux , since a fraction of the unresolved nuclear pa@xmath3 emission , as well as part of the pa@xmath3 emission within the cone , might be due to star formation as well .",
    "the flux of the agn - subtracted pa@xmath3 integrated within a radius of 30 pc ( @xmath117 ) is @xmath118 erg s@xmath108 @xmath119 . if we assume that the extinction derived from the h ",

    "we speculate that the gas streaming from the gas bar enters the ionization cone , contributing significantly to the coronal line region and to the innermost part of the narrow line region .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of gas inflow motions towards the active nucleus of the circinus galaxy caused by the non - axisymmetric potential of a nuclear gas bar . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for dust associated with the bar comes from the hst / nicmos @xmath0 color map , whereas the streaming motions along the gas bar are seen in the velocity field of the h@xmath1s(1)(10 ) emission line . </S>",
    "<S> the gas bar is about 100pc long with a visual extinction in excess of 10mag . </S>",
    "<S> indication for the gaseous nature of this bar comes from the lack of a stellar counterpart even in the @xmath2 band where the extinction is greatly reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> we also use the nicmos emission line images ( pa@xmath3 , [ sivi ] , and [ feii ] ) to study the innermost region of the ionization cones and the nuclear star forming activity . </S>",
