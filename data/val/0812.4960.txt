    "a phenomenon is scale invariant if it has no characteristic length or time .",
    "scale invariance emerged as a paradigm in the early 1970 s following the tremendous successes of the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "liquids described by scale - invariant potentials are a theorist s dream by having a number of simple properties @xcite .",
    "if potentials vary with distance as @xmath0 , the configurational free energy @xmath1 as a function of density @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 may be written @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , all properties of inverse power law ( ipl ) liquids  in appropriately defined reduced units  are functions of @xmath6 only .",
    "even dynamical properties are simple , e.g. , the relaxation time @xmath7 may be written as @xmath8 with the same exponent @xmath9 that characterizes the thermodynamics , @xmath10 being the reduced time unit ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "unfortunately the predicted equation of state does not fit data for real fluids , and ipl liquids do not have low - pressure liquid states .",
    "both problems derive from the absence of molecular attractions ; these define the spatial scale of one intermolecular distance at low and moderate pressure .",
    "thus real liquids have apparently little in common with scale - invariant liquids . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate by example that there is nevertheless a `` hidden '' approximate scale invariance in a large class of liquids , the van der waals liquids .",
    "consequently several properties of ipl liquids apply to van der waals liquids , leading to a number of experimentally testable predictions .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that several model liquids exhibit strong correlations between the equilibrium fluctuations of the potential energy @xmath12 and the virial @xmath13 ( defining the contribution to pressure coming from the intermolecular interactions via @xmath14 ) .",
    "`` strongly correlating liquids '' include @xcite the standard lennard - jones liquid , a liquid with exponential short - range repulsion , the kob - andersen binary lennard - jones liquid , a seven - site united - atom model of toluene , the three - site lewis - wahnstrm model of ortho - terphenyl ( otp ) , as well as a model consisting of asymmetric `` dumbbell '' type molecules .    for inverse power - law ( ipl ) potentials @xmath15",

    "@xcite that strongly correlating liquids are well approximated by inverse power - law potentials as regards their thermal equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the present paper presents concrete proofs that this is the case  even for _ molecular _ model liquids with van der waals type interactions ( i.e. , excluding hydrogen , ionic , and covalent bonds ) .",
    "the main conclusions below are :    * _ at a given density and temperature the energy surface of a strongly correlating molecular liquid may be replaced to a good approximation by that of inverse power - law potentials .",

    "we have provided direct evidence for an underlying ipl scale invariance in model molecular van der waals liquids , leading to three experimentally testable predictions for these liquids : i ) the density scaling exponent @xmath9 can be identified from the equilibrium fluctuations via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem determining the frequency - dependent linear thermoviscoelastic response functions @xcite ; ii ) different state points with same @xmath6  same values of @xmath57 and @xmath80  are  isomorphic  ,",

    "this is consistent with recent experimental findings for molecular glass formers and amorphous polymers ( excluding hydrogen bonds ) : varying pressure and temperature , state points with the same relaxation time have the same shape of the dielectric @xmath81-relaxation function @xcite .",
    "finally , the hidden scale invariance explanation of density scaling explains why one observes density scaling of the dynamics , without the same scaling applying to the pressure @xcite .",
    "the hidden scale invariance is a consequence of the strong virial / potential energy correlations @xcite characterizing van der waals liquids , as well as most or all metallic liquids .",
