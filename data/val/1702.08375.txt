    "an examination of the cea was performed by dmitrasinovic , donnelly and gross  @xcite who considered the required polarization measurements .",
    "they concluded that a cea , determining the electroproduction transversity amplitudes up to an overall phase , was not possible with either recoil or target polarization measurements alone , but required at least one measurement from the other polarization set .",
    "they further concluded that a cea could be constructed without the need for more complicated measurements involving both a polarized target and recoil polarization detection .",
    "these conclusions assumed that all structure functions could be separated in a set of measurements .",

    "the cea and tpwa are equivalent and both can be resolved with the same number of 12 observables measured at a single angle .",
    "again , when the information from more than one angle is available , the number of observables can be drastically reduced to only five , which need to be measured at maximally three angles .    finally , in set 6 , we discuss the full set of seven @xmath64 wave multipoles , which requires 14 measurements for a unique solution . in this case",
    "we find a minimal number of six observables , where again recoil polarization can be completely avoided .",

    "each observable obtains two more legendre coefficients , and therefore allows for two additional independent angular measurements .",
    "the number of multipoles increases with @xmath68 and the number of different measurements by @xmath69 . with six observables ,",
    "the number of measurements increases by 12 for each additional angular momentum , therefore there is no principal limit for @xmath66 . in practice",
    "this is , however , very different .",
    "our present numerical simulations are approaching a limit for @xmath70 .",
    "all examples with @xmath65 are calculated with the mathematica nsolve function , giving exact solutions within integer algebra .",
    "this approach was no longer successful for @xmath71 , therefore , instead of finding exact solutions , we have done a minimization of the coupled equations using the mathematica nminimize function and random search methods .",
    "this worked very well and for the solutions with @xmath71 the squared numerical deviation was found to be of the order @xmath72 , in agreement with our work on photoproduction .",
    "so far , we have always assumed that a complete separation of all observables ( response functions ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsigmafull ] ) has been obtained in a first preparatory step . for most of these ,",
    "e.g. with @xmath5 dependence or beam polarization @xmath40 , this is straightforward and has been applied very successfully in the past .",
    "a problem is the so - called rosenbluth separation between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which is experimentally very challenging and has only been done in a very few cases  @xcite .",
    "however , for a tpwa the combination @xmath75 can be used and a separation is not necessary . in many cases that are discussed in table  [ tab3 ] , the observables @xmath76",
    "can be replaced by the rosenbluth combinations @xmath77 and we find a unique solution for all included partial waves . in the special case of set 1 , with only three observables ,",
    "this is not possible and a fourth observable is needed .    in 2005 , the hall a collaboration at jlab published a measurement on ` recoil polarization for @xmath78 excitation in pion electroproduction ' , where 14 separated response functions plus two rosenbluth combinations had been observed in full angular distributions at @xmath79  gev and @xmath80  ( gev / c)@xmath81  @xcite . in our notation",
    ", these are @xmath82 for a cea , this set of observables is not complete .",
    "a complete experiment analysis for electroproduction needs a minimum of 12 observables including both target and recoil polarization .",
    "in fact , with two more observables involving also target polarization , a cea would be possible .",
    "these are e.g. @xmath83 or @xmath84 or @xmath85 or many other combinations .    for a tpwa ,",
    "however , the 16 observables from the hall a experiment are by far complete .",
    "only a subset of 6 observables , at maximally 3 angles , is needed for a unique solution of all @xmath64 wave multipoles , e.g. @xmath86,r_{rb}^{y'0}[2],r_{lt}^{00}[2],r_{lt}^{x'0}[2],r_{lt'}^{00}[2],r_{lt'}^{x'0}[3]$ ] .",
    "we have explored the cea and tpwa approaches to pseudoscalar - meson electroproduction , extending our previous study of photoproduction .",
    "simple examples , corresponding to a low angular momentum cutoff , simplify the discussion and allow one to see how the cea and tpwa are related . as in photoproduction , the tpwa can be accomplished with fewer observable types supplemented by additional angular measurements .",
    "the resulting tpwa ( multipole ) amplitudes have an undetermined phase depending on energy while the cea ( transversity or helicity ) amplitudes are found with an unknown overall phase depending on both energy and angle .",
    "comparisons are given for representative cases in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the cea requires measurements involving both polarized targets and recoil polarization , as was stressed in the study of ref .",
    "this is similar to the finding , for cea analyses and photoproduction , that measurements are required from two out of the three groups containing beam - target , beam - recoil , and target - recoil observables .",
    "triple polarization experiments give no further information in photoproduction , which is different from electroproduction .",
    "for purely transverse observables it is the same , but for purely longitudinal @xmath66 and longitudinal - transverse interference terms @xmath38 and @xmath87 this is different .",
    "already the terms without target and recoil polarization , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 have to be counted as single beam polarizations with a polarized virtual photon . by this way of counting , there are six triple polarization observables , see table  [ tab : obs1 ] , all of which can be measured in an alternative triple polarization measurement . in electroproduction , as in photoproduction , all 36 observables can be measured in an alternative way , giving in total 72 possibilities for allowed measurements . however , as was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tpwa can be accomplished without involving observables having both polarized targets and recoil polarization .",
    "this is not the case for a cea , where at least 2 observables have to be chosen from another group .",
    "this finding from photoproduction carries over to electroproduction without further modification .",
    "the present formalism can be immediately applied to data .",
    "in fact , there exists a dataset  @xcite which measured 16 observables , mostly with recoil polarization but was conducted without a polarized target .",
    "even though this set was not complete for a cea , it was by far enough to fulfill the requirements of a complete tpwa ."
