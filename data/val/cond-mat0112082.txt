    "in recent years , most industrialized societies have started to see the limits of the growth of urban traffic .",
    "the traffic demand in metropolitan areas has largely exceeded the vehicular capacity and we face the problem of increasing pollution and growing frequency of accidents .",
    "typical remedies such as the expansion of road way systems or road improvement do not work well anymore . as a consequence ,",
    "many metropolitan areas seek to solve this problem by constructing additional roadway , but this is undesirable due to political and environment objections or impractical because of the high costs of construction .",
    "thus , the consistent management of large , distributed man - made transportation systems has become more and more important for planning and prediction of traffic .",
    "computer simulations as a means of evaluating , planning , and controlling traffic systems have gained considerable importance . lately , more and more work has been done to consider the dynamical aspects of the traffic system .",
    "specially , the micro - simulation work has taken great advantage of models developed in classical research areas such as physics , mathematics , and computer science .",
    "computer models can be used to simulate the influence of governmental actions like road - pricing or building of new highways @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in solving the traffic problems . moreover",
    ", output data of traffic models can be used as an input to climate models for calculating traffic - caused air pollution and the dependency of this pollution on time - limits .    for this reason , in the last few years",
    "there has been considerable interest in the investigation of traffic flow using methods and models from statistical physics , especially the cellular automata ( ca ) models have allowed the large - scale simulations of large traffic networks faster than real time @xcite .",
    "these kind of models are so - called _ particle hopping models_. recently , particle hopping models using ca has emerged as a very promising alternative to describe the traffic flow @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "cellular automata are alternatives to differential equations in an attempt to model transportation systems .",
    "ca s are dynamical systems in which space and time are discrete .",
    "a cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells , each of which can be in one of a finite number of possible @xmath0 states , updated synchronously in discrete time steps according to a local , identical interaction rule .",
    "the state of a cell is determined by the previous states of the surrounding neighborhood of cells .",
    "thus , ca models have the desirable capacity to capture micro - level dynamics and relate these to macro - level behavior .",
    "also they are capable of representing individual vehicle interactions and relating these interactions to macroscopic traffic flow metrics , such as throughput , time travel , vehicle speed , etc .",
    "in addition , ca models are suitable to represent both single and multi - lane traffic in an easy form , which is particularly crucial for the modeling of highways @xcite .",
    "the technical difference between car - following and ca models for traffic flow is that in the latter , space and time are discrete , whereas in the car - following models , they are continuous . simulations of car - following models use discrete time but the space is continuous .",
    "the objective of this paper is to explore a new minimal ca  model for the high - speed simulation of microscopic traffic alternatives .",
    "we use particle hopping models as a starting point for this investigation because their highly discrete nature reduces the number of free parameters . here",
    ", we present a new extension of a ca model for a single - lane highway on a ring built on the pioneering work of nagel ( ns ) and his colleges @xcite .",
    "the ns model has been applied to the project transims on transportation simulation .",
    "this model consider four rules to update the state of the road involving braking , acceleration , stochastic driver reaction , and the car movement .",
    "the ns model decelerates a vehicle if its distance from the vehicle in the front is less than its current speed but does not consider the speed of the vehicle ahead . by including a parameter of safe distance we determine the distance that one vehicle must maintain with respect to the vehicle in the front by taking their speeds into account .",
    "the knowledge of this speed is a property of some kind of automated vehicles .",
    "we analyze the relationship between the flow and the density , the so - called fundamental diagram , and we find that the new model works better under the condition of high traffic density . by analyzing the variance of speed and its relationship with the flow , we show that the behavior of this variance can have important consequences for the design and control of traffic flow . we think that knowledge of this relationship can be very useful for analyzing _ automated system _ especially for vehicles equipped with infrared sensors to determine the distance and the velocity from other vehicle . recently such vehicles have been used to study an automated traffic @xcite . in the following we will refer as automated vehicles to this kind of vehicles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we give a brief description of our model which modifies the existing ns model by an inclusion of a safety criterion . in section 3 ,",
    "the results of computer simulations from the new model are presented , by analyzing fundamental diagrams for different values of the safety parameter . in this section",
    ", we also show that a suitable safety factor produces a lesser speed variance .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "4 concludes with a short summary and discussion of our findings .",
    "our model is a probabilistic cellular automaton .",
    "it consists of @xmath1 cars moving on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 cells with periodic boundary conditions ( the number of vehicles is conserved ) .",
    "space and time are discrete and hence also the velocities .",
    "each cell is either empty , or it is occupied by just one vehicle ( see fig .",
    "1 ) with a discrete velocity @xmath3 with the same limt speed . in the present paper ,",
    "velocity ranges are from @xmath4 the limit speed .",
    "this limit speed may be different depending of the kind of vehicle under consideration , trucks , cars , etc .",
    "however , here will use the same maximum velocity for all the vehicles , then we consider only one type of car .",
    "the velocity is equivalent to the number of sites that a vehicle advances in one time step  provided that there are no obstacles ahead .",
    "vehicles only move in one direction .",
    "the length of a cell is around @xmath5 @xmath6 , which is interpreted as the length of a vehicle plus the distance between vehicles in a jam , but can be suitably adjusted with respect to the problem under consideration .",
    "one time step @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) lasts 1 s , which is of the order of the reaction time of humans .",
    "then , @xmath9 means @xmath10 km / h in real units .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the current velocity and position respectively of the vehicle @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the velocity and position respectively of the vehicle ahead ( preceding vehicle ) in a fixed time .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 , the distance ( number of empty cells ) in front of the vehicle in the position @xmath12 . in the context of ca models proper units",
    "are often omitted due to the given discretization of space and time .",
    "thus , the proper units for the model would be : @xmath17=$]number of cells , @xmath18=$]number of cells per time step , @xmath19=$]number of time steps , etc . for that reason we will use @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 , because @xmath22 .",
    "we have the following set of rules , which are applied in _ parallel _ ( simultaneously ) for all cars :    s1 : acceleration ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "if @xmath24 , the velocity of the car @xmath25 is increased by one , i.e. ,    @xmath26    this rule simulates that all the drivers like to reach the maximum velocity     s2 : randomization ( @xmath27 ) . if @xmath28 , the velocity of the car @xmath25  is decreased randomly by one unity with probability @xmath29 , i.e. ,    @xmath30 with probability @xmath31    this rule represents all the random situations , such as the random driver behavior or the random highway physical state .",
    "s3 : deceleration ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "if @xmath33 , the velocity of the car @xmath25  is reduced to ( @xmath34 , i.e. , the new velocity of the vehicle @xmath25 is :    @xmath35 .",
    "the term @xmath36 represents the driving schemes respecting the safety distance ( gap ) and this distance is determined by the safe distance  parameter @xmath37 the physical meaning of @xmath38 will be discussed latter .",
    "s4 : vehicle movement ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "each car is moving forward according to its new velocity determined in steps 1 - 3 , i.e. ,    @xmath40    the  rules ",
    "@xmath41 allow to obtain the new velocities . then the vehicles are moved ( @xmath42 thus , one has to divide the update in two parts , the first part is to obtain the new velocities while the second part is the movement of cars .",
    "step 1 reflects the general tendency of the drivers to drive as fast as possible without crossing the maximum speed limit .",
    "the randomization in step 2  takes into account the different behavioral patterns of the individual drivers , specially , nondeterministic acceleration as well as overreaction while slowing down .",
    "this is important for the spontaneous formation of traffic jam .",
    "step 3 is intended to avoid collision between the cars .",
    "we use a parallel updating scheme since it takes into account the reaction time and can lead to a chain of overreactions .",
    "suppose , a car slows down due to the randomization step , and if the density is large enough then this might force the following cars to brake in the deceleration step .",
    "in addition , if @xmath29 is larger than zero , it might brake even further in step 2 .",
    "the main modification to the ns model takes place in step 3 . to determine @xmath43 consistently for all vehicles ,",
    "step 3 must be iterated ( @xmath44 times .",
    "we consider the distance between the vehicles @xmath45 and @xmath46 and their coresponding velocities .",
    "the knowledge of the velocity of the vehicle ahead is incorporated through the safety parameter @xmath38 .",
    "this parameter may take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "if @xmath38 takes its maximum value , @xmath47 the speed of the vehicle ahead is not considered in the deceleration process ( such as the ns model , which has been compared succesfully with standard traffic flow in germany ) . on the contrary , when @xmath48 the speed of the vehicle ahead is considered without restrictions , i.e. , without establishing a safe distance .",
    "this fact is regarding those automated vehicles which can obtain information from the vehicles in front of them .",
    "thus , the safe distance parameter may allow us to define the required degree of automation for the system .",
    "this model is a minimal model in the sense that all the four steps are necessary to reproduce the basic features of real traffic . however , additional rules may be needed to capture more complex situations .",
    "thus , the parameters of the model are the following : the limit speed @xmath49 , the braking parameter @xmath29 , the global density @xmath50 and the parameter of safe distance @xmath37 in our case , @xmath38 takes the following values@xmath51 this latter parameter determines the safety distances between two vehicles depending of the gap between them and their speeds .",
    "thus , if @xmath38 is smaller the restrictions of safety for the system are lesser and the safety is lower .",
    "before going on , we would like to describe our standard simulation set  up for the following observations .",
    "we simulated a system of length @xmath52 sites with closed boundary conditions , ( i.e. traffic was running in a loop ) for a given value of @xmath29 and @xmath38 .",
    "we start with random initial conditions .",
    "@xmath1 cars are randomly distributed on the lane around the complete loop with an initial speed taking a discrete random value between 0 and @xmath53 .",
    "since the system is closed , the average density remains constant with time .",
    "next , we update the individual car velocities and positions in accordance with the rules of the model .",
    "each density is simulated for @xmath54 time steps , of which the first half were discarded to let transients die out and for the system to reach its asymptotic steady state .",
    "later , we start to extract data to make the statistical analysis .    for each simulation , we establish a value for parameter @xmath38 by taking into account the desired degree of safe distance among vehicles@xmath55 for example , the case of @xmath56 is equivalent to taking into account the distance between two cars and the exact velocity of the vehicle ahead , i. e. , we allow that a vehicle may be behind the other one with the same speed without the existence of a safe distance between them to prevent accidents .    a convenient way to investigate the model is to draw a diagram of flow versus density , the so - called fundamental diagram .",
    "it is a smooth curve with a well - defined maximum at a certain density , @xmath57 by analyzing the fundamental diagram , we found that for a given @xmath58 the flux exhibits a maximum at the density @xmath59  that decreases when the range of interaction of the vehicles increases and the length of this interaction is determined by the safety parameter @xmath38 . in particular , we found that for @xmath60 the flow and the magnitude of @xmath61 decrease with increasing @xmath38 . on the contrary , for all @xmath62 the magnitude of @xmath61 decreases with decreasing @xmath38 and the flow increases .",
    "moreover , smaller @xmath38 is , i.e. as the safety factor tends to zero , the longer the length of interaction of the vehicles is and the flow decreases more rapidly ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    on the other hand , for @xmath56 and @xmath60 we can distinguish two different dynamical regions of traffic flow .",
    "flow is linearly increasing with increase in traffic density ( laminar flow , free - flow ) ; beyond @xmath63 the flow becomes linearly decreasing in density ( back traveling start - top waves ) . in the free - flow region",
    "all vehicles can move with high speed close to the speed limit and the average speed converges to the maximum velocity .",
    "however , beyond a certain density , a further increase of the density leads to a more rapid decay of flow due to the strong length correlation among vehicles and jams emerge ( as in fig .",
    "2 ) .  nevertheless ,",
    "for @xmath64 we distinguish an additional mixed flow region where the flow increases with increasing @xmath65 but the vehicles do not move with maximum velocity , the speeds of vehicles start decreasing@xmath55    by analyzing the relationship between velocity and density we observe that the velocity decreases more rapidly with decreasing @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .  as a consequence",
    "the vehicles move rather slowly in this region as compared to the free - flow region .",
    "the flow takes higher values increasing the highway vehicular capacity due to formation of small platoons of vehicles with similar velocities to avoid the propagation of jams .     on the other hand , for all @xmath66 increasing @xmath29 not only leads to lesser flow but also lowers @xmath61 ( see fig 4a ) .",
    "in addition , we found that for small @xmath29 and @xmath67 , the flow has the same behavior , i.e. the system is insensitive to the braking @xmath29 ( see fig 4b ) .",
    "we now examine the higher moments of the velocity distribution . in particular , we examine the speed variance and its behavior . for all values of @xmath38 , during both free - flow and congested phases ( where the average speed tends to the maximum speed ) the speed variance is negligible . in particular , for values of @xmath38 such that there does not exist the region of mixed flow , i.e.  @xmath68 or @xmath67 , the speed variance starts to increse immediately after the free - flow phase .",
    "this variance continues increasing with density until the variance reaches its maximum value , which occurs after the free - flow phase ( as shown in the fig . 5 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath64 values we observe a local maximum of the speed variance after the free - flow phase , but during the mixed flow phase we note a local minimum in the variance before the maximum flow is reached ( see fig . 6 for @xmath69 ) ; the speed variance newly starts to increase and reaches its maximum value after the density of maximum flow .    by comparing the maximum flow and the maximum speed variance for @xmath56 and @xmath69 ( fig . 5 and 6 respectly )",
    "we observe that the maximum flow for @xmath56 is @xmath70 higher than for @xmath71 , although the maximum speed variance at @xmath69 is 50% smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "the behavior observed is a consequence of the safety factor we introduced , i.e , if the safety factor is higher , there exists a smaller propagation of fluctuactions and prevent variations of speeds by the formation of platoons or clusters of vehicles",
    ".    in general for all values of @xmath38 the density where the speed increases until it is maximum value occurs after the maximum flow density , @xmath61 ( the goal of most traffic planners ) .",
    "high speed variance means that different vehicles in the system have widely varying speeds .",
    "it also means that a vehicle would experience frequent speed changes per trip through out the system . in turn , this results in higher trip travel time variance . in reality",
    ", this could also increase the probability of traffic accidents .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to attempt to steer traffic away from the density immediately after the density of maximum flow .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced and investigated a statistical model capable of describing the traffic of automated vehicles accurately , considering a safety factor for the distance between two vehicles .",
    "we modified an existing ca model to capture interesting characteristics of traffic flow . here , we studied the addition of a safe distance parameter , @xmath72 to the nagel - shreckenberg model to consider the anticipation of a driver .",
    "this modification allows the two vehicles to be as near as possible by respecting a safe distance , i.e. , a driver decides his new velocity by taking into account the velocity from the driver ahead and the distance that exists between them .",
    "we think that a suitable safety factor is important to study the behavior of traffic flow and increasing the vehicular capacity . by the inclusion of the consideration of the velocity of the vehicle ahead in the process of deceleration by taking into account a safe distance ( i.e.",
    ", the driver knows the velocity of the preceding vehicle ) we can obtain different correlations among vehicles that can increase the capacity of vehicles and decrease the maximum flow .",
    "a decrease in the capacity implies an increase in the maximum flow or the speed variance reaches its maximum value after the region of mixed flow ; whereas for safety factors very big or null ( there does not exist distance of safety ) this variance reaches its maximum value inmediately after the region of free - flow . thus , the definition of  a suitable safety factor may increase the vehicular capacity .    finally , our approach here was to search for minimal sets of rules which reproduce certain macroscopic facts .",
    "the advantage of this model is that relations between rules and macroscopic behavior can be more easily identified ; and we also obtain higher computational speed .",
    "thus , the particle hopping models are a good tool to simulate a big scale traffic flow .",
