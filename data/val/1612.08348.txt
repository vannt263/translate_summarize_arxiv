    "a large number ( @xmath5 ) of galaxy clusters are detected in the planck all - sky survey @xcite via the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey turns out to be distributed nearly more or less uniformly over the entire sky .",
    "since the sz signal amplitude depends mainly on the mass of clusters and not on their redshift , all the most massive ( with masses @xmath6@xmath7 ) galaxy clusters in the universe are detected in the planck survey .",
    "this sample of galaxy clusters is unique and very important for various cosmological studies , such as constraining cosmological parameters using the measurements of the galaxy cluster mass function ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of the clusters detected in the _ planck _ survey are known galaxy clusters that were detected previously in various optical or x - ray surveys . however , about half of the detected objects turn out to be previously unknown clusters . for these objects",
    "additional optical observations should be carried out in many cases , to optically identify them with galaxy clusters and to measure their redshifts .",

    "the observations were carried out in approximately the same way at all telescopes .",
