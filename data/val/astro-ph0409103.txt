    "the centers of disk galaxies are conventionally thought to be dominated by a `` classical '' bulge : a spheroidal , kinematically hot structure similar to a small elliptcal galaxy , which produces the central excess of light above that of the exponential disk .",
    "however , kormendy ( 1982 , 1993 ) argued that in at least some galaxies the central light came from flattened , disklike components he termed `` pseudobulges , '' possibly the result of bar - driven gas inflow and star formation . at present , very little is known about the demographics of such structures . to address this",
    ", we are undertaking a systematic study of bulge morphology and kinematics in early - type disk galaxies .",
    "we have performed a preliminary analysis for about two - thirds of the barred s0 galaxies in our sample , using long - slit spectroscopy from the isis spectrograph of the 4.2 m wht and kinematic data from the literature ( kormendy 1982 ; simien & prugniel 2000 ; caon et al.2000 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  1 , which plots @xmath0 for the photometric bulge regions of fourteen barred s0 galaxies .",
    "half of the galaxies lie on or slightly below the isotropic oblate rotator line , indicating kinematics like those of classical bulges or less luminous ellipticals ( e.g. , davies et al.1983 ) .",
    "but the other half lie above , making them kinematic pseudobulges .",
    "the seven pseudobulges see here imply a lower limit of 30% for the entire sample of barred s0s . for four of these seven ",
    "ngc  2787 , ngc  2950 , ngc  3945 , and ngc  4371  we have morphological and/or kinematic evidence that the pseudobulge consists of _ two _ components ( e.g. , erwin et al .",
    "2003 ) : a disklike region ( distinct from the galaxy s main , outer disk ) and a central region more like a classical bulge .       to mean velocity dispersion @xmath1 in the photometric bulge region versus the ellipticity of that region .",
    "the solid line is the relation for isotropic oblate rotators ( i.e. , `` classical '' bulges and lower - luminosity ellipticals ; binney 1980 ) ; galaxies below it are probably dominated by velocity anisotropy , while galaxies above it are dominated by rotation .",
    "the crosses are elliptical galaxies from davies et al .",
    "( 1983 ) ; the open circles are edge - on bulges in early - type disk galaxies ( kormendy & illingworth 1982 ; jarvis & freeman ( 1985 ) . the barred s0 bulges from our sample are filled boxes .",
    "circled bulges have morphological evidence for multiple components in the photometric bulge region ; open boxes indicate kinematics for the innermost regions of ngc  2950 and ngc  4371.,width=364 ]"
