    "the associated change in the mass  radius relation of the secondary causes the orbital period @xmath0  to increase again .",
    "the abrupt cutoff in the period distribution of cvs locates the observed period minimum at 77min ( e.g. kolb &  baraffe 1999 ) .",
    "short - period cvs with @xmath0@xmath6min which approach the period minimum have observed secondaries with spectral types dm4dm6 . for @xmath0@xmath7min",
    ", the secondary stars are expected to be of still later spectral type and have escaped detection so far ( e.g. beuermann et al .",

    "v592 her may be such a system ( van teeseling et al .",
    "1999 ) .    direct observational proof of this evolutionary scenario is scarce so far .",
    "spectroscopic detection of the secondaries in short - period dwarf novae is extremely difficult because the accretion disc and the white dwarf dominate the optical / near ir emission of the systems .",
    "the situation is more favourable in magnetic cvs which lack a disc . in these systems",
    ", accretion ceases at irregular instances and reveals the naked binary .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss low state observations of the 81-min magnetic cv ef eri ( wheatley & ramsay 1998 ) which allow us to set tight limits on the spectral flux and on the physical nature of the secondary .",
    "wheatley &  ramsay ( 1998 ) found ef eri in a low state in february 1997 with v varying between 17.95 and 18.20 . besides photometry",
    ", they performed spectrophotometry on february 7 and 8 using the eso 3.6-m telescope at la silla / chile equipped with the focal reducer spectrograph efosc1 accretion did not cease completely as is evidenced by balmer line emission and weak cyclotron emission in the red / infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "cyclotron emission was observed only during linear polarization phases 0.50.9 and was removed from the individual spectra using the difference spectrum between cyclotron maximum and the cyclotron free spectra as a template . in the two nights ,",
    "the observations started at airmasses 1.1 and 1.2 and were carried on until airmasses 1.8 and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "a slow flux decrease was observed with increasing airmass , probably caused by the deteriorating seeing at lower altitude .",
    "we adopted the flux level of the cyclotron - free spectra at the beginning of the observations ( airmass @xmath8 ) and corrected this level to zero airmass .",
    "a nearby standard star of early spectral type was used to correct for the telluric o@xmath9 and h@xmath9o bands .",
    "this correction minimizes the excursions from a smooth continuum and causes the resulting spectrum to be artificially smooth at the centre of the between 7600 and 7660 .",
    "the resulting mean spectrum is shown in fig.1 as the upper solid line and the narrow uncertain section between 7600 and 7660  is shown as the dashed line .",
    "the pronounced dips at 6300 , 6500 , and 6800  are the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 zeeman components of h@xmath13",
    ". zeeman tomography of the magnetic - field structure of ef eri will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we fit the continuum of the white dwarf at wavelengths @xmath14  ( excluding the h@xmath13  absorption and emission line region ) with pure - hydrogen line - blanketed magnetic and non - magnetic model atmosphere spectra ( jordan 1992 , gnsicke et al .",
    "the best fit is achieved for a mean effective temperature of @xmath15 k ( dashed curve in fig.1 ) .",
    "the observed spectral flux and the surface flux of the white dwarf for gives an angular radius radians . using magnetic model atmospheres yields a temperature lower by @xmath16k and an identical angular radius . as in other polars ,",
    "the remnant modulation of the blue continuum of 0.2 mag ( wheatley & ramsay 1998 ) can be explained by a moderately hot spot of 15000k covering 6% of the cross section of the white dwarf .",
    "the model spectrum excellently fits the observed continuum between 5300 and 9000  with no evidence for a contribution by the companion .",
    "we estimate the maximum possible contribution by the unseen companion , using the calibration of the surface brightness of late type main sequence stars in the prominent @xmath17  tio / vo band ( beuermann 1999 , and paper in preparation ) .",
    "this calibration is based on the zams stellar model radii of baraffe et al .",

    "fig.2 shows the derived surface fluxes @xmath18 of the late - type dwarfs gl644c = vb8 ( m7 ) , gl752b = vb10 ( m8 ) , and lhs2065 ( m9 ) .",

    "the observed flux of the companion which corresponds to @xmath19  is denoted @xmath25 .",
    "we subtract test fractions of the spectra of these stars from the observed spectrum and judge the acceptable contribution by eye .",
    "the lower solid curve in fig.1 shows the effect of an assumed contribution of lhs2065 which amounts to 5% of the observed flux at 7500 .",

    "it is the coldest of all white dwarfs in cvs which have a reliably determined temperature ( gnsicke 1999 ) .",

    "we conclude that the companion is either a transition object or a brown dwarf .",
    "the true age of the white dwarf must exceed @xmath93 because the temperatures of accreting white dwarfs are kept above those of field white dwarfs of the same age by compressional heating of their envelopes ( sion 1995 , warner 1995 , gnsicke et al .",
    "if entirely due to accretion , @xmath2=9500k requires a mean accretion rate not exceeding that expected from gravitational radiation , @xmath98ergs@xmath22s@xmath23  ( gnsicke 1999 ) , lending further support to a rather high white dwarf mass and a substellar companion .",
    "the substellar nature of the companion is supported also by considerations of the evolutionary state of ef eri .",
    "one of the main results of the theory of cv evolution is the recognition that a period bounce occurs when @xmath99@xmath33  and the secondary becomes increasingly degenerate .",
    "the orbital period of ef eri is 4 min longer than the observed minimum period @xmath100@xmath101min and still further above the theoretical value of 67min ( kolb &  baraffe 1999 ) .",
    "if ef eri evolved from longer periods , it is now either approaching the minimum or has already passed it . at 4 min above the _ calculated",
    "_ period minimum the donor mass / temperature would be either 0.08@xmath33/2500k or 0.05@xmath33/1500k , while at a calculated period of 81min these numbers would be 0.10@xmath33/2900k and 0.035@xmath33/1000k ( kolb &  baraffe 1999 ) .",
    "since a spectral type l implies @xmath2@xmath102k , we conclude that ef eri has passed @xmath100 .",
    "if it formed with a brown dwarf secondary of age @xmath103gyr , the companion would have @xmath2@xmath102k at @xmath0=81min , too ( kolb & baraffe 1999 ) . in both cases",
    "the companion is substellar with @xmath104@xmath33 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between calculated and observed @xmath100is not yet understood .",
    "possible explanations include ( i ) the presence of an additional mechanism of angular momentum loss and ( ii ) a mechanism which causes cvs with stellar secondaries to become unobservable before they reach @xmath100 .",
    "as the most likely value of the companion mass is @xmath105@xmath33  and ef eri is still a bright x - ray source our result argues against the second explanation .",
    "ef eri is a key object for our understanding of cv evolution . obtaining a trigonometric parallax would allow to determine accurate values of the mass , luminosity , and accretion rate of the white dwarf .",
    "infrared spectrophotometry will allow to detect the companion ( @xmath106@xmath107 for companions as late as l8 ) against the veiling flux of the white dwarf ( @xmath106@xmath108 ) .",
