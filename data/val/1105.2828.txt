    "the strong correlation arising out of a complete quench of the kinetic energy of the electrons in a two dimensional ( 2d ) system in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 leads to the striking phenomenon called fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite . in the fractional quantum hall regime , the applied magnetic field is strong enough to make the lowest landau level have more states than the number of electrons in the system leading to a huge degeneracy which is lifted only by the electron - electron interaction leading to the fractional quantum hall states ( fqhs ) @xcite . a way to understanding the nature of these states",
    "is provided by the composite fermion(cf ) theory @xcite in which the state of the system is described in terms of cfs which correspond to electrons bound to an even number @xmath1 of vortices of flux quantum @xmath2 .",
    "these cfs are weakly interacting and experience a reduced effective magnetic field @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron density . the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) of cfs with filling factor @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an integer ,",
    "can be shown to describe fqhe of electrons with filling factor @xmath7",
    ".    the cfs posses topological character due to the attached quantized vortices .",
    "this feature of the cf theory can also be understood by carrying out chern - simon ( cs ) transformation on the electron field operators .",
    "such a transformation @xcite leads to the introduction of a topological cs vector potential @xmath8 which produces cs magnetic field , @xmath9 , proportional to the electron density @xmath10 .",
    "the factor @xmath11 ensures that the statistics of the quasiparticles remain fermionic .",
    "the main difference between the cs quasiparticles and cfs is that the flux attachment for the former is singular at the electron s position while the vortex associated with a cf has finite size and is hence free from any such singularity . to distinguish cfs from these quasiparticles",
    ", we shall refer to them as cs - cfs in the rest of this work .",
    "we note that in spite of the difference mentioned above , the effective magnetic field seen by cs - cfs is @xmath12 as in the case of cfs and the iqhe of cs - cfs also reproduce fqhe of electrons with @xmath7 in the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "the fermionic cs theory has also been applied to systems with su(2 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "for example , the fqhs in lll of a single layer system with spin degree of freedom @xcite and a double layer system @xcite with frozen spin has been described using such an analysis .",
    "it is well - known that the cs method correctly describes spin ( layer ) polarizations for fqhs for a single layer system with spin degree of freedom ( bilayer system with frozen spin ) .",
    "more recently , both iqhe @xcite and fqhe @xcite have been observed in single layer graphene whose effective low - energy theory is described in terms of dirac - like quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "these dirac quasiparticles are centered around the edges of the hexagonal brillouin zone of graphene which hosts the dirac cones .",
    "there are six such cones ; however only two of them turn out be inequivalent since the rest of the cones differ from one of these by reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "this leads to two inequivalent species of dirac quasiparticles in graphene .",
    "these quasiparticles , apart from their physical spin , carries an additional quantum number which specifies their location in the graphene brillouin zone .",
    "this is commonly known as the valley quantum number .",
    "the valley degree of freedom thus acts like a fictitious spin providing an additional internal symmetry to these quasiparticles . in the presence of physical spin and in the absence of any symmetry breaking interactions , the internal symmetry of these quasiparticles is thus su(4 ) .",
    "this is manifested in the hall conductivity for iqhe in graphene , @xmath13 for integer @xmath14 , where the factor @xmath15 arises due to the spin and the valley degrees of freedom .",
    "fqhe in the lll for graphene has been studied by a number of authors @xcite . in refs .",
    ", fqhs for spin - polarized electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the fqhs are su(2 ) symmetric due to the valley degrees of freedom , has been studied . however , given that the zeeman energy in graphene is small compared to the landau level splitting ( the ratio of the two is approximately @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) , a full su(4 ) symmetric fqhe seems to be more relevant in graphene .",
    "such su(4 ) symmetric fqhs has been studied using su(4 ) generalized cf wave functions @xcite and halperin - like wave functions @xcite .",
    "the former @xcite described a restricted class of filling factor which arises from equal even integral flux @xmath11 attached to each species of dirac quasiparticles leading to @xmath18 $ ] with @xmath19 being the effective integer filling factors of four different species of cfs . in this scheme ,",
    "one obtains the spin and the valley polarizations of the fqhs for a given @xmath20 depending on the individual values of @xmath21 s ( keeping their sum fixed ) . for example",
    ", the cf scheme describes @xmath22 with zero spin and valley polarizations for @xmath23 which corresponds to intra - species exponent @xmath24 and inter - species exponent @xmath11 in the jastrow form of the corresponding cf wave functions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the work of ref .   computes the spin and the valley polarization directly from the proposed halperin - like wave functions .",
    "interestingly , ref",
    ".   describes some fqhs which does not have definite spin , valley or mixed polarizations .",
    "these states do not feature in ref .. this contradiction , to the best of our knowledge , has not been yet resolved in the sense that there is no uniform formalism which reproduces all fqhs obtained from both these methods .",
    "finally , ref",
    ".   computes hall conductivity using a su(4 ) symmetric cs action , but does not aim to analyze the details of the several possible fqhs .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a cs theory for su(4 ) fqhe which is relevant for monolayer graphene .",
    "the central point of our work is to introduce a general flux attachment scheme by using a cs coupling matrix .",
    "we choose the corresponding elements of this coupling matrix such that an even number of flux quanta , which may depend on the spin and valley quantum numbers , is attached to all electrons and that any electron with a given spin and valley quantum number sees an integer number of flux attached to other electrons with different ( spin and valley ) quantum numbers . using this cs matrix",
    ", we obtain a list of possible fqhs that might occur in graphene and also propose wave function for those states .",
    "we show that our formalism not only reproduces the fqhs obtained in ref .   and thus resolves the contradiction mentioned above , but also provides an exhaustive list of other possible fqhs in this system including those which do not have any su(2 ) analogues .",
    "we provide an exhaustive chart of these fqhs for several filling factors along with various polarizations ( valley , spin and mixed ) for each of them .",
    "finally , we note that our analysis is directly relevant for fqhs in both spin - polarized bilayer graphene ( with layer and valley degrees of freedom providing the su(4 ) symmetry ) and conventional bilayer quantum hall systems ( with layer and spin degrees of freedom providing the su(4 ) symmetry ) .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec.[formalsim ] , we develop the su(4 ) cs theory , derive equations for the filling factor @xmath20 , the spin ( s ) , the valley ( v ) and the mixed ( m ) polarizations using this theory , and propose wavefunctions which describes the obtained fqhs .",
    "this is followed by sec.[analysis ] , where we analyze these equations to provide an exhaustive list of possible fqhs for monolayer graphene .",

    "<S> we choose the corresponding elements of the cs coupling matrix such that an even number of spin and valley quantum number dependent flux quanta is attached to all electrons and that any electron with a given spin and valley quantum number sees an integer number of flux attached to other electrons with different ( spin and valley ) quantum numbers . using this cs matrix </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a list of possible fractional quantum hall states that might occur in graphene and propose wavefunctions for those states . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also applies to fractional quantum hall states of both bilayer quantum hall systems without spin polarization and bilayer spin polarized graphene . </S>"
