    "cosmic rays ( crs ) interacting with turbulent magnetic fields get scattered and accelerated ( see melrose 1968 , schlickeiser 2002 ) .",
    "the theoretical description of these scattering and acceleration processes are essential for understanding the penetration and modulation of low - energy cosmic rays in the heliosphere , the confinement and escape of galactic cosmic rays from the galaxy , and the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms .",
    "a key factor in cr scattering are the properties of the magnetic fields .",
    "a standard approach is the assumption of a superposition of a mean magnetic field @xmath0 and a turbulent component @xmath1 . whereas the mean field",
    "can easily be meassured in the solar system ( here we find approximatelly @xmath2 ) , the turbulent component has to be emulated by turbulence models . in the literature",
    "there is no consensus available about the true turbulence properties ( see cho & lazarian 2005 for a review ) . in the solar system , however , some turbulence properties such as the wave spectrum can be obtained from meassurements ( see e.g. denskat & neubauer 1983 , bruno & carbone 2005 )",
    ".    more unclear are the orientation of the turbulence wave vectors ( also refered to as turbulence geometry ) and the dynamical decorrelation of the magnetic fields . in a recent cr diffusion study ( shalchi et al .",
    "2006 ) a slab/2d composite model was combined with a nonlinear anisotropic dynamical turbulence ( nadt ) model .",
    "this model can be used to reproduce meassured cr mean free paths parallel and perpendicular to the mean field @xmath3 .",
    "the authors of this article assumed that the slab correlation time scale is independent of the wave vector @xmath4 .    in a recent study ( lazarian & beresnyak 2006 )",
    ", however , it was shown that the slab time scale is indeed @xmath5dependent .",
    "more precisely it was found that @xmath6 ; here we used the correlation time @xmath7 , the correlation rate @xmath8 , the alfvn speed @xmath9 , and the outer scale of the turbulence @xmath10 .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to apply this new result of the slab correlation time scale onto cosmic ray parallel diffusion .",
    "a comparison with solar wind observations of the parallel mean free path is also presented .",
    "it is demonstrated that we can find a much larger parallel mean free path if we employ the correlation time scale of lazarian & beresnyak ( 2006 ) .    in section 2",
    "we explain the turbulence model that is used in this article . in section 3 a quasilinear description of cosmic ray scattering",
    "is combined with this turbulence model to derive analytic forms of the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient and the parallel mean free path . in section 4",
    "we evaluate these formulas numerically to compute diffusion coefficients and we also provide a comparison with previous results and solar wind observations . in the closing section 5",
    "our results are summerized .",
    "the key input into a cosmic ray transport theory like qlt is the tensor @xmath11 which describes the correlation of the turbulent magnetic fields : p_lm ( , t ) = therefore the @xmath4-dependence and the time - dependence of the correlation tensor @xmath12 have to be specified which is done in the next two subsections .      for mathematical simplicity",
    "we employ the often used slab model for the turbulence geometry .",
    "physical processes that can induce slab modes are differential damping of fast mode waves ( yan & lazarian 2002 ) or instabilities ( lazarian & beresnyak 2006 ) .    by assuming the same temporal behavior of all tensor components we have p_lm ( , t ) = p_lm^slab ( ) ^slab ( k_,t ) [ c2e2 ] with the dynamical correlation function @xmath13 and the time independent correlation tensor @xmath14 .",
    "the tensor @xmath14 is determined by the turbulence geometry and the wave spectrum whereas the function @xmath15 describes dynamical effects .",
    "for pure slab turbulence we have @xmath16 and therefore p_lm^slab ( ) & = & g^slab(k _ ) ( k _ ) k _ + & & \\ {    ccc _ lm - k_l k_m k^2 & if & l , m = x , y + 0 & if & l or m = z    .",

    "furthermore , we used the slab bendover scale @xmath18 , the dissipation wavenumber @xmath19 , the turbulence strength @xmath20 , the inertial range spectral index @xmath21 and the dissipation range spectral index @xmath22 .",

    "( 1995 ) concluded from ulysses observations that the parallel mean free paths of pickup protons is 2 au at 2.4 mv rigidity ( they stated conservatively that @xmath36 is of order 1 au but actually they obtained the best fit for 2 au ) . it should be noted that this observation was at high heliographic latitudes , and at a heliocentric distance of 2.34 au ; these differences should be remembered when comparing with observations at earth orbit .",

    "( 1998 ) concluded from ampte ( active magnetospheric particle tracer explorers ) spacecraft observations that the parallel mean free paths of pickup helium ranges from 0.16 to 0.76 au at 5.6 mv rigidity in the data they analyzed .",

    "as shown , for small rigidities , where dissipation effects are important , we obtain a much larger parallel mean free path for electrons . for medium rigidities where the charged particles interact resonantly with the inertial range of the spectrum , the new parallel mean free path is about a factor 5 smaller since we assumed pure slab fluctuations ( in comparison to the slab/2dspace . ]",

    "it seems that the improved model for the slab correlation function provides a much larger electron parallel mean free path for low energetic particles .",
    "the theoretical explanation of measured parallel mean free paths in the solar system is a fundamental problem of space science . in a recent article ( shalchi et al .",
    "2006 ) it has been demonstrated the these observations can indeed be reproduced theoretically . by using recent results of turbulence theory ( lazarian & beresnyak 2006 ) we further improved the dynamical correlation function which is a key input in transport theory considerations .",
    "it is demonstrated in this article that the improved slab correlation time scale ( see eq .",
    "( [ alexmodel ] ) ) leads to a much larger parallel mean free path ( see fig . [ nadtf4 ] ) .",
    "this effect is important since it was argued in several previous articles that the theoretical parallel mean free path is too small ( palmer 1982 , bieber et al .",
    "1994 ) in comparison with solar wind observations .",
    "another problem of cosmic ray scattering theory is the importance of nonlinear effects .",
    "whereas we have applied qlt in the current article it was argued in other papers ( e.g. shalchi et al .",
    "2004 ) that nonlinear effects are important for parallel diffusion . however , these nonlinear effects are directly related to the interaction between charged particles and 2d modes .",
    "these 2d modes were neglected since we assumed pure slab fluctuations .",
    "therefore , qlt can be applied and the results presented in this article should be valid . for non - slab models , where 2d modes are present , however , the applicability of qlt is questionable .",
    "it has to be subject of future work to explore the validity of qlt for realistic turbulence models such as dynamical turbulence models in non - slab geometry .",
