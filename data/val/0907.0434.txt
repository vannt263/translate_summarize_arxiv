    "the _ cosmological standard model _",
    "@xcite well describes many parts of the universe evolution and it takes into account the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as the highest symmetric background .",
    "in fact , considering the mean energy - density at big scales , _",
    "i.e. _ , greater than @xmath0 @xmath1 , it tends to an homogeneous distribution . on the other hand",
    ", the universe observation at small scales shows a very inhomogeneous and anisotropic matter- and energy - distribution . in this respect , the isotropic hypothesis of the _ cosmological principle _",
    "@xcite is not based on the big - scale observations but on the strong isotropy of the cosmic background radiation , which has a black - body spectral - distribution at @xmath2k with temperature fluctuations of order @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the cosmological standard model is confirmed by the primordial - nucleosynthesis prediction for the light elements , which is in agreement with direct observations .",
    "such a dichotomy between the isotropy of region at red - shift @xmath4 and the extreme irregularity of the recent universe , @xmath5 , is at the ground of the interest in the study of the gravitational instability for the structure formation .",
    "the study of the cosmological perturbation evolution can be separated in two distinct regimes : the linear regime , concerning _",
    "density contrast _",
    "@xmath6 much less than the unity , and the non - linear one in which @xmath7 , giving rise to the effective structure formation . despite the approximate hypotheses , the linear regime provides interesting predictive information also at low red - shift , since an analytical description can be addressed to study the growth of the density contrast .",
    "as matter of fact , we underline that the study of the perturbation dynamics in the radiation - dominated early universe requires a pure relativistic treatment , in order to correlate the matter fluctuations with the geometrical ones @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution during the matter - dominated era can be consistently described using the newtonian approximation picture , as soon as sub - horizon - sized scales are treated . in this scheme ,",
    "the fundamental result of the density - perturbation analysis is the so - called _ jeans mass _ , which is the threshold value for the fluctuation masses to condense generating a real structure .",
    "if masses greater than the jeans mass are addressed , density perturbations begin to diverge as function of time giving rise to the gravitational collapse @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are aimed to consider dissipative effects into the fluid dynamics , in the linear newtonian regime .",
    "the starting point is the eulerian set of equations governing the fluid motion ( section 2 ) on which one can develop a perturbative theory by adding small fluctuations to the unperturbed background ( see also @xcite ) . in particular , we introduce in the first - order analysis the so - called _ bulk viscosity _",
    "( we neglect the shear or first viscosity since we are dealing with homogeneous model and no internal frictions arise ) .",
    "such kind of viscosity can be expressed in terms of the thermodynamical parameters of the fluid . following the line of the `` landau school '' @xcite",
    ", we phenomenologically describe this quantity as a function of the universe energy density @xmath8 via a power - law : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a parameter which defines the intensity of viscous effects , see also @xcite .",
    "two different cases are treated : the standard _",
    "jeans mechanism _ @xcite and the generalization in presence of the expanding universe @xcite . in the first approach ( section 3 ) , the unperturbed background is assumed to be characterized by a static and uniform solution of the fluid parameters while , in the second case ( section 4 ) , we consider the effects of the universe expansion on the zeroth - order dynamics which is now described by the _",
    "friedmann eq.s_ for an homogeneous and isotropic universe .    as a result",
    ", we show how the presence of bulk viscosity damps the density - contrast growth , suppressing the structure formation in the _ top - down fragmentation scheme _",
    "@xcite ( mainly associated with the hot dark - matter phenomenology @xcite ) without changing the threshold value of the jeans mass .",
    "in fact , in both cases , the grater the viscosity coefficient is , the slower the density contrast diverges in time , in the limit @xmath12 . in this respect , considering a collapsing macro - structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , of mass greater than the jeans mass , if viscosity becomes sufficiently large then the jeans fragmentation mechanism is deeply unfavored since the sub - scale density - contrasts are damped .",
    "in particular , in treating the jeans model , bulk viscosity affects the perturbation evolution generating a new decreasing regime in place of the pure oscillatory behavior addressed in the jeans analysis .",
    "the main merit of this work is to be determined in having traced a possible scenario for fragmentation processes in presence of viscosity .",
    "we infer that the unfavored nature of the top - down mechanism , appearing when a viscous trace is present , can survive also in the non - linear regime when dissipative effects play surely an important role in the structure formation .",
    "in order to describe the newtonian evolution of a fluid , we here want to introduce the eulerian equations governing the fluid parameters : the density @xmath8 , the local 3-velocity @xmath13 ( of components @xmath14 ) and the pressure @xmath15 , in presence of a gravitational potential @xmath16 .",
    "adiabatic _ ideal _ fluids are governed , in newtonian regime , by the following set of equations @xcite : the _ continuity eq .",
    "_ , which guarantees the energy conservation @xmath17 the _ euler eq .",
    "_ , which ensures the momentum conservation @xmath18 while pressure and density are linked by the _ eq . of state _ ( eos ) : @xmath19 . in this picture",
    ", the sound speed is defined by the relation @xmath20 .",
    "let us introduce the effects of the energy dissipation during the motion of the fluid , due to the thermodynamical non - reversibility and to internal friction ( we neglect the thermal conductivity ) . to obtain the motion equations for a viscous fluid , we have to include some additional terms in the ideal fluid description . the continuity eq .",
    "is derived by the time evolution of the matter density and by the mass conservation law .",
    "this way , it remains valid for any kind of fluid .",
    "euler eq . , in absence of the gravitational field , rewrites ( here @xmath21 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the momentum - flux energy - tensor .",
    "if ideal fluids are addressed , we deal with completely reversible transfer of momentum , obtaining the expression : @xmath24 .",
    "viscosity is responsible for an additional term @xmath25 to this expression due to another irreversible momentum transfer , where non - vanishing velocity gradients are present . for a viscous fluid",
    "we get @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the _ stress tensor _ and @xmath25 is called the _ viscous stress - tensor_.    the general form of @xmath25 can be derived by a qualitative analysis of the velocity gradients in presence of uniform rotation and volume changes of the fluid .",
    "the most general form of the viscous stress tensor is @xcite @xmath28 where the coefficients @xmath29 e @xmath30 are not dependent of velocity ( the fluid is isotropic and its properties must be described only by scalar quantities ) and the term proportional to @xmath29 coefficient vanishes for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 contraction . here , the coefficient @xmath29 is called _ shear viscosity _ while @xmath30 denotes bulk viscosity and they are both positive quantities .    using continuity eq . , the ideal fluid euler eq .",
    "rewrites @xmath33 and the motion equation of a viscous fluids can now be obtained by adding the expression @xmath34 to the rhs of the equation above , obtaining @xmath35\\,+\\ , { \\partial}_\\alpha(\\zeta\\,{\\partial}_\\gamma v_\\gamma)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the viscous coefficients are not constant and we have to express their dependence on the state parameters of the fluid . since we are interested to treat isotropic and homogeneous perturbative cosmological models , we can safely neglect the first viscosity ( shear viscosity ) in the unperturbed dynamics .",
    "in fact , in such models there is no displacement of matter layers with respect to each other and this kind of viscosity represents the energy dissipation due to this effect .",
    "indeed , in presence of small inhomogeneities such affect should be taken into account , in principle .",
    "however , in this work , we are aimed at studying the behavior of scalar density perturbations . in this respect ,",
    "volume changes of a given mass scale are essentially involved and , therefore , we concentrate our attention to bulk - viscosity effects only .",
    "in fact , we expect that the non - equilibrium dynamics of matter compression and rarefaction is more relevant than friction among the different layers .",
    "according to literature developments @xcite , we now assume the bulk - viscosity coefficient as a function of the energy density @xmath36 expressed via a power - law of the form @xmath37 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a constant parameter which defines the intensity of viscous effects . with these assumptions , the euler eq .",
    "takes the following form @xmath38 which is the well - known _ navier - stokes eq_.    this analysis is developed without considering the gravitational field , which has to be introduced in the euler eq . as usual",
    "we have also to consider the equation describing the gravitational field itself : the _ poisson eq_. let us now recall the set of motion equations in the case of an adiabatic viscous fluid :    [ newtonian - motion - eq ] @xmath39    such a system is the starting point to analyze the gravitational instability .",
    "the universe is uniform at big scales but many concentrations are presented at small scales , _",
    "e.g. _ , galaxies and clusters , where the mass density is larger than the universe mean - density .",
    "these mass agglomerates are due to the gravitational instability : if density perturbations are generated in a certain volume , the gravitational forces act contracting this volume , allowing a gravitational collapse .",
    "the only forces which contrast such gravitational contraction are the pressure ones , which act in order to maintain uniform the energy density .",
    "the jeans mechanism analyzes what are the conditions for which density perturbations become unstable to the gravitational collapse .",
    "this model @xcite is based on a newtonian approach and the effects of the expanding universe are neglected .",
    "the fundamental hypothesis of such an analysis is a static and uniform solution for the zeroth - order dynamics @xmath40 of course , this assumption contradicts the gravitational equation , but we follow the original jeans analysis imposing the so - called `` jeans swindle '' @xcite .",
    "we underline that our study will focus on universe stages when the mean density is very small : in particular the recombination era , after decoupling .",
    "this way , the effects of bulk viscosity on the unperturbed dynamics can be consistently neglected in view of its phenomenological behavior ( [ bulk - power - law ] ) .      in the standard jeans model ,",
    "a perfect fluid background is assumed . after setting @xmath41 in the motion equations ( [ newtonian - motion - eq ] ) ,",
    "let us add small fluctuations to the unperturbed solution : @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , only adiabatic perturbations are treated and the sound speed is defined as @xmath43 . substituting such expressions in the system ( [ newtonian - motion - eq ] ) , after standard manipulation ( we remark that second - order terms are neglected ) , one differential equation for the density perturbations can be derived : @xmath44 to study the properties of @xmath45 , we now consider a plane - wave solutions of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are the angular frequency and the wave number , respectively .",
    "this way , one can obtain the following dispersion relation @xmath50    in this scheme , two different regimes are present : if @xmath51 a pure time oscillatory - behavior for density perturbations is obtained . while if @xmath52 , the fluctuations exponentially grow in time , in the @xmath12 asymptotic limit ( _ i.e. _ , we choose the negative imaginary part of the angular frequency solution ) and the gravitational collapse is addressed since also the density contrast @xmath53 diverges .",
    "the condition @xmath54 defines the so - called _ jeans scale _ @xmath55 and the jeans mass @xmath56 ( which is the total mass in a sphere of radius @xmath57 ) . such threshold quantities read @xmath58    let us now analyze in some details the two regimes .",
    "in the case @xmath59 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath60 ) , @xmath45 behave like two progressive sound waves ( with constant amplitude ) propagating in the @xmath61 directions with velocity @xmath62 . in the limit @xmath63",
    ", the propagation velocity approaches the value @xmath64 , and fluctuations behave like pure sound waves . on the other hand , if @xmath65 , stationary waves are addressed ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath66 ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath67 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath68 ) , density perturbations evolve like stationary waves with a time dependent amplitude . in particular , choosing the negative imaginary part of the solution for @xmath69 , the wave amplitude exponentially explodes , generating the gravitational collapse .",
    "let us now analyze how viscosity can affect the gravitational - collapse dynamics .",
    "we recall that the only viscous process which can be addressed in an homogeneous and isotropic model is bulk viscosity .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of this section , we are able to neglect such kind of viscosity in the unperturbed dynamics , which results to be described by the static and uniform solution ( [ static - swindle - solution ] ) .",
    "we now start by adding the usual small fluctuations to such a solution , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath70 . in treating bulk - viscosity perturbations ,",
    "we use the expansion @xmath71 where @xmath72 substituting all fluctuations in the system ( [ newtonian - motion - eq ] ) , we get the first - order motion - equations of the model    [ system - first - order ] @xmath73    with some little algebra , one can obtain an unique equation for density perturbations , describing the dynamics of the gravitational collapse : @xmath74    using the linearity of the equation above , a decomposition in fourier expansion can be performed . this way , plane waves solutions ( [ plane - wave ] ) can be addressed , obtaining a generalized dispersion relation @xmath75    as in the standard jean model , the nature of the angular frequency is responsible of two different regimes for the density - perturbation evolution .",
    "the dispersion relation has the solution @xmath76 thus we obtain the time exponential - regime for @xmath77 and a damped oscillatory regime for @xmath78 .",
    "it s worth noting that the pure oscillatory regime of the ideal fluid jeans mechanism is lost .",
    "the equation @xmath79 admits the solutions @xmath80 and @xmath81 which read @xmath82 the existence of such solutions gives rise to a constraint on the viscosity coefficient : @xmath83 .",
    "an estimation in the recombination era is assumed and the constant @xmath84 can be derived from the expression expression @xmath56 ( [ jeans - mass ] ) .",
    "universe is dominated by matter and we can impose the values : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . using these quantities",
    "one finds @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the threshold value @xmath93 . ] after decoupling , yields to the value @xmath94 and confronting this threshold with usual viscosity ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath95 ) , we can conclude that the range @xmath96 is the only of physical interest .",
    "finally we obtain : @xmath77 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath78 for @xmath99 .",
    "let us now analyze the density - perturbation exponential - solutions in correspondence of @xmath100 : @xmath101 to obtain the structure formation , the amplitude of such stationary waves must grow for increasing time .",
    "the exponential collapse for @xmath12 is addressed , choosing the @xmath102 sign solution , only if @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath104 with @xmath105 . as a result",
    ", we show how the structure formation occurs only if @xmath67 , as in the standard jeans model .",
    "the viscous effects do not alter the threshold value of the jeans mass , but they change the perturbation evolution and the pure oscillatory behavior is lost in presence of dissipative effects . in particular ,",
    "we get two distinct decreasing regimes : for @xmath99 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath106 ) , we obtain a damped oscillatory evolution of perturbations : @xmath107 while , for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , density perturbations exponentially decrease as @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , in the limit @xmath12 .      as shown above , since the pure oscillatory regime does",
    "not occurs , we deal with a decreasing exponential or a damped oscillatory evolution of perturbations .",
    "this allows to perform a qualitative analysis of the top - down fragmentation scheme @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the comparison between the evolution of two structures : one collapsing agglomerate with @xmath112 and an internal non - collapsing sub - structure with @xmath59 .",
    "if this picture is addressed , the sub - structure mass must be compared with a decreasing jeans mass since the latter is inversely proportional to the collapsing agglomerate background mass . this way ,",
    "as soon as such a jeans mass reaches the sub - structure one , the latter begins to condense implying the fragmentation . in the standard jeans model , this mechanism",
    "is always allowed since the amplitude for perturbations characterized by @xmath59 remains constant in time . on the other hand , the presence of decreasing fluctuations in the viscous model , requires a discussion on the effective damping and an the efficacy of the top - down mechanism .",
    "of course , such an analysis contrasts the hypothesis of a constant background density , but it can be useful to estimate the strength of the dissipative effects .",
    "we now study two cases for different values of the bulk - viscosity coefficient : @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in this analysis",
    ", a perturbative validity - limit has to be set : we suppose @xmath115 as the limit of the model and we use the recombination era parameters @xmath116 , in particular the initial time of the collapse is define as the beginning of the matter - dominated universe , _ i.e. _ , @xmath117 .    in correspondence of a very small viscosity coefficient ( fig.1 )",
    ",        we consider a decreasing structure of mass @xmath118 within a collapsing galaxy with mass @xmath119 , the jeans mass is @xmath120 .",
    "the sub - structure wave - number @xmath121 is in the region @xmath122 and the density perturbations evolve like ( [ osc - smorzata ] ) .",
    "fluctuations have to be imposed small at the initial time @xmath123 , this way , we consider density contrasts ( @xmath124 for the galaxy and @xmath125 for the sub - structure ) of @xmath126 . in this scheme ,",
    "the galaxy starts to collapse and the validity limit is reached at @xmath127 . as a result , in fig.1 we can show how the sub - structure survives in the oscillatory regime during the background collapse until the threshold time value @xmath128 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that , if the viscous damping is sufficiently small , the galaxy formation occurs .",
    "let us now discuss the case @xmath114 ( fig.2 ) by changing the sub - structure mass , which is now @xmath129 .        here , the viscosity coefficient is greater than one and the damping effects is stronger .",
    "in fact , when the galaxy density contrast reaches the threshold value @xmath130 , we obtain @xmath131 .",
    "the top - down mechanism for structure formation results to be unfavored by the presence of strong viscous effects : the damping becomes very strong and the sub - structure vanishes during the agglomerate evolution .",
    "let us now analyze the behavior of small perturbations , using newtonian equations , on the expanding - universe background @xcite .",
    "the equations which describe the homogeneous- and isotropic - universe evolution are the well - known friedmann eq.s .",
    "such equations are derived by einstein eq.s using a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor as the matter source of the gravitational field .",
    "it s worth remarking that , we can safely address a newtonian scheme for astrophysical models , as soon as we treat problems in which the energy density is dominated by non - relativistic particles and in which the linear scales involved are small compared with the characteristic scale of the universe .",
    "such a matter - dominated universe is described by the flrw metric @xmath132 with an eos so that @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , here @xmath135 is the scale factor of the universe .    as in the jeans model",
    ", we here use the power - law ( [ bulk - power - law ] ) to describe bulk viscosity , which results to be proportional to a positive power of the energy density in the matter - dominated scheme we consider . this way ,",
    "being the matter density very small , we can consistently neglect viscosity in the unperturbed dynamics .",
    "the zeroth - order solution corresponds to the evolution of an homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with the following source : @xmath136 $ ] .",

    "results to be satisfied since the friedmann eq.s hold .    to obtain the time dependence of the parameter involved in the model , we limit our analysis to early times , since fluctuations arise from the recombination era and , furthermore",
    ", the jeans mass is so small for recent times that it is of little interest @xcite .",
    "this way , the study is restricted to scale factors satisfy the condition @xmath151 , so that @xmath152 and we can use the zero - curvature solution without loss of generality . setting @xmath153 in the cosmological equation ( [ eq - cosmologica ] ) and using the solution @xmath154 ( [ unperturbed - universe ] ) , one can get the following time dependence @xmath155 the study of the gravitational instability is characterized by the evolution of the density contrast and , in particular , of the small fluctuations . in this respect , we underline that @xmath156 takes account for first - order terms and we have to explicitly write its time dependence during the universe expansion . for a general specific heat ratio @xmath157 , we can assume that the pressure varies as @xmath158 and the speed of sound is find to be @xmath159    such solutions characterize the background dynamics of the expanding universe .",

    "i.e. _ , gravitational collapses for @xmath209 are addressed if @xmath210 the effect of dissipative processes is to modify the evolution of perturbations .",
    "in fact , comparing expression ( [ power - law - density - contrast ] ) wrt the non - dissipative behavior of growing density contrast @xmath211 , see ( [ density - contrast - weinberg ] ) , one can show that the relation @xmath212 is always verified .",
    "we can conclude that the effect of bulk viscosity is to damp the density contrast evolution , suppressing the structure formation as in the jeans mechanism .",
    "the effects induced by the presence of bulk viscosity have been analyzed in two different cases in a perturbative scheme : the standard jeans mechanism and the generalization in treating an expanding universe background . in both approaches",
    ", viscosity has been introduced in the first - order dynamics via a power - low function of the energy density and the effects produced on the unperturbed dynamics have been consistently neglected in view of the phenomenological nature of such kind of viscosity .",
    "the main result , in dealing with the viscous generalization of the models proposed , has been to show how bulk viscosity damps the density contrast evolution maintaining unchanged the threshold value of the jeans mass .",
    "such an effect suppresses the sub - structure formation in the top - down fragmentation mechanism .    in particular , in the analysis of the dissipative jeans model",
    ", a new decreasing regime for perturbations has been found .",
    "the presence of such a behavior allowed the study of the top - down scheme for small and strong viscous effects . in the first case ,",
    "the density - perturbation amplitude of a sub - structure remains substantially constant during the main structure collapse . on the other hand ,",
    "if viscous effects are sufficiently strong , the sub - structure vanish in the linear perturbative regime , unfavoring the fragmentation .    in the second part of this work",
    ", the static and uniform background solution for the unperturbed evolution has been generalized by the dynamics of an homogeneous and isotropic friedmann universe . in this scheme ,",
    "a jeans - like relation has been obtained and a considerable damping of the density contrast growth has been found ."
