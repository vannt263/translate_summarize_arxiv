    "the hierarchy of lifetimes of heavy hadrons can be understood in the heavy - quark expansion ( hqe ) , which makes use of the disparity of scales present in the decays of hadrons containing b - quarks .",

    "this agreement also provides us with some confidence that quark - hadron duality , which states that smeared partonic amplitudes can be replaced by the hadronic ones , is expected to hold in inclusive decays of heavy flavors .",
    "the heavy - quark expansion also provides a qualitative understanding of the hierarchy of lifetimes of charmed hadrons .",

    "the only remaining problem appears in the ratios of lifetimes of heavy mesons and baryons .",
    "for instance , the low experimental value of the ratio @xmath8 has long been a puzzle for the theory .",
    "the latest compilation of experimental observations  @xcite suggests that ( _ b)/(b_d)|_ex= 0.797 0.053 , which is inconsistent with the first theoretical predictions of this ratio ,",
    "@xmath9  @xcite at the level of approximately @xmath10 . only recent next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations of perturbative qcd  @xcite and @xmath0 corrections  @xcite to spectator effects significantly reduced the discrepancy , yielding , as reported in @xcite , ( _ b)/(b_d)|_th= 0.88 0.05 , which appears in some agreement with experimental data , mainly due to sizable theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "the problem of @xmath8 ratio could reappear again if future measurements at fermilab and cern would find the mean value to stay the same with error bars shrinking .",
    "upcoming fermilab measurements of @xmath1 lifetime could shed more light on the experimental side of this issue .    here",

    "the effect on the @xmath1-@xmath2 lifetime ratio is quite substantial , at the level of @xmath93 .",
    "this can be explained by the partial cancellation of ws and pi effects in @xmath1 baryon and constructive interference of @xmath0 corrections to the spectator effects .",
    "there is no theoretically - consistent way to translate the histograms of figs .",

    "predictions obtained this way should be treated with care , as it is not expected that the theoretical predictions are distributed according to the gaussian distribution .",

    "@xcite , but different from refs .",
    "@xcite , given the relative simplicity of the higher - order operators in our basis . in the above calculations we used the following notation for local four - quark operators : o_1^q & = & |b_i^(1-_5)b_i|q_j_(1-_5)q_j ,   o_2^q =    o_3^q & = & |b_i^(1-_5)b_i|q_j__5q_j , as well as @xmath99 operators that follow from the expressions for @xmath100 by interchanging the color indexes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 dirac spinors .",

    "note that in the predictions for lifetime ratios , large matrix elements of the `` color - singlet '' operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 are multiplied by a relatively small combination of wilson coefficients , while matrix elements of `` color - octet '' operators come with large wilson coefficients  @xcite . nevertheless , the interpretation of matrix elements obtained in the vacuum insertion approximation ( i.e. representing the matrix elements of four - fermion operators as products of two matrix elements of current operators separated by a vacuum state ) is relatively clear in this basis . for the dimension-6 operators this procedure introduces four new scale - dependent parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 , [ matel ] b_q |q^q| b_q & = & b_1 ( ) ,   b_q |q^q_s| b_q = b_2 ( ) , + b_q |t^q| b_q & = & _ 1 ( ) ,   b_q |t^q_s| b_q = _ 2 ( ) .",

    "of course , these matrix elements would eventually have to be computed model - independently , using lattice qcd or qcd sum rules . in the absence of model - independent results , we obtain numerical predictions for the ratios of lifetimes , by relating matrix elements of the computed operators constituting @xmath0 and @xmath11 effects to the matrix elements of the operators of dimension 6 ( @xmath105 ) using quark model .",
    "we then use lattice qcd predictions for the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 and look at the ratio of the subleading- and leading - order spectator effects .",

    "a similar logic can be used to estimate @xmath11-suppressed matrix elements .",
