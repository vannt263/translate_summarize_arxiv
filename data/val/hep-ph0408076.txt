    "the lep2 experiments have successfully confirmed the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) . at the same time , they inspire numerous estimations of possible new heavy particles beyond the sm . in particular , searching for `` new physics '' has already become an obligatory part of the reports on modern experiments in high energy physics . to describe possible signals of new physics beyond the sm the lep2 collaborations apply both the model - dependent and the model - independent analysis of experimental data .",
    "the former approach means the comparison of experimental data with the predictions of some specific models which extend the sm at high energies . in this way a number of grand unified theories , the supersymmetry models were discussed and their parameters have been restricted .",
    "these model - dependent bounds are adduced in the reports @xcite .",
    "in the model - independent approach one fits some low - energy parameters such as the four - fermion contact couplings . to establish a model - independent fit one has to take into consideration all possible coupling constants of a new heavy particle with the sm particles and introduce the observables which pick only one of these parameters . to find the expected signals the lep collaborations have applied a `` helicity model fit '' . in this analysis an effective lagrangian describing contact interactions of massless fermion states with one specific helicity ( axial - axial ( aa ) model , vector - vector ( vv ) model , etc . )",
    "was introduced and the corresponding couplings have been restricted .",
    "this approach , giving a possibility to detect the signals of new physics , does not discern the specific state ( its quantum numbers ) responsible for them .",
    "this is because the particle interactions are described by a number of structures which contribute to different `` helicity models '' .",
    "therefore a specific particle contributes to a number of the `` models '' .    in this regard , it seems resonable to develop an approach allowing to pick out in a model - independent way the parameters of new heavy particles with specified quantum numbers . in the previous papers @xcite we established a model - independent search for manifestations of a heavy abelian @xmath0 boson beyond the sm .",
    "the key point of this analysis was the fact that for any theory beyond the sm which is renormalizable one ( but unspecified in other respects ) some relations between the unknown low energy @xmath0 couplings with fermions hold @xcite .",
    "in particular , they require an universal value of the @xmath0 couplings to the axial - vector fermion currents . taking into account these model - independent relations as well as the kinematics features of the processes @xmath3",
    ", we introduced the unique sign - definite observable to select the signal of the virtual @xmath0 state @xcite .",
    "the value of the observable measures the @xmath0-induced four - fermion coupling of the axial - vector currents .",
    "the analysis of the lep2 data set on @xmath3 processes has shown that the mean value of the observable is in an accordance with the signal although the accuracy is at the 1@xmath4 confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "clearly , this could not be regarded as the actual observation of the particle .    as numerous estimates for various scattering processes showed the lep2 data",
    "set is not too large to detect the signals of new physics at more then the @xmath5 cl ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "such an accuracy is insufficient for a real discovery .",
    "however , one may believe that the signals would appear more evidently if the statistics increases .",
    "one of the ways to ensure that within the existing data set is to follow the third of the described approaches and investigate other processes where the virtual states of the chosen new heavy particles contribute and can be identified . if again the observables to single out them are introduced and the data set is treated accordingly , one obtains an independent information about the states . then , dependently on the results , one is able to conclude about the existence of the states and their characteristics by accounting for both of experiments that increases statistics .",
    "these speculations served as a motivation for investigations carried out in the present paper in order to search for the abelian @xmath0 gauge boson in the bhabha processes @xmath6 .",
    "we introduce new model - independent observables sensitive to the vector , @xmath7 , and axial - vector , @xmath8 , @xmath0 couplings to the electron ( positron ) currents .",
    "they can be constructed from differential cross - sections at the lep2 energies as well as at the energies of future electron - positron colliders ( @xmath9 gev ) .",
    "as an application , we analyse the existing in the literature lep2 data on the bhabha process and derive limits on fitted parameters . the comparison with the results obtained already for the @xmath10 processes",
    "we also confront our results with other analysises for bhabha process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we introduce the effective lagrangian describing the @xmath0-boson interaction with fermions at low energies as well as other necessary information on the model - independent search for this state at low energies . in sect .",
    "iii we investigate the differential cross - sections with taking into consideration the relations between @xmath8 and @xmath7 parameters peculiar for the abelian @xmath0 that gives a possibility to identify this virtual state . in sects .",
    "iv , v the observables to pick out @xmath11 and @xmath12 are introduced .",
    "the last two sections are devoted to the analysis of the lep2 data and discussion .",
    "the @xmath0-boson can be introduced in a phenomenological way by specifying its effective low - energy couplings to the known sm particles @xcite . considering the @xmath0 effects at energies much below the @xmath0 mass",
    ", it is enough to parametrize the tree - level @xmath0 interactions of renormalizable types , only .",
    "such a possibility is provided by the decoupling theorem @xcite from which , in particular , it follows that the non - renormalizable @xmath0 interactions are produced by loops at higher energies and suppressed by powers of the inverse @xmath0 mass . the sm gauge group @xmath13 is usually considered as a subgroup of an underlying theory gauge group , so the vector - boson interactions of types @xmath14 , @xmath15 , ... are absent at a tree level @xcite .",
    "thus , to investigate the @xmath0 effects in the leptonic processes at the energies of lep experiments ( @xmath16 gev ) or future electron - positron colliders ( @xmath17 gev ) we use the lagrangian : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sm scalar doublet , @xmath20 denotes the @xmath0 field before the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , and summation over the all sm left - handed fermion doublets , @xmath21 , and the right - handed singlets , @xmath22 , is assumed .",
    "the notation @xmath23 stands for the charge corresponding to the @xmath0 gauge group , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electroweak covariant derivatives .",
    "diagonal @xmath26 matrices @xmath27 , @xmath28 and numbers @xmath29 mean the unknown @xmath0 generators characterizing the model beyond the sm .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) generally leads to the @xmath30@xmath0 mixing of order @xmath31 which is proportional to @xmath32 and originated from the diagonalization of the neutral vector boson mass matrix .",
    "this mixing contributes to the scattering amplitudes and plays an important role at the lep2 energies @xcite .",
    "the low energy @xmath0 couplings to a fermion @xmath33 are parameterized by two numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 . alternatively",
    ", the couplings to the axial - vector and vector fermion currents , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are often used .",
    "their specific values are determined by the unknown model beyond the sm .",
    "assuming an arbitrary underlying theory one usually supposes the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 are to be independent numbers .",
    "however , as it was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , for any renormalizable theory beyond the sm these parameters content some relations which follow from the renorlalization group equations and the decoupling theorem . in case of the @xmath0 boson",
    "this is reflected in correlations between @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "these correlations are model - independent in sense that they do not depend on an particular underlying model .",
    "the detailed discussion of these issues and the derivation of the rg relations are presented in ref .",
    "therein , in particular , it is shown that the low energy abelian @xmath0 couplings are constrained by the relations @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the third component of the fermion weak isospin , and @xmath40 means the isopartner of @xmath33 ( namely , @xmath41 ) .    the correlations ( [ 2 ] )",
    "result in important properties of the abelian @xmath0 couplings .",
    "they ensure , in particular , the invariance of the yukawa terms with respect to the effective low - energy @xmath42 subgroup corresponding to the abelian @xmath0 boson . as it follows from the relations , the couplings of the abelian @xmath0 to the axial - vector fermion currents have the universal absolute value proportional to the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublet .",
    "so , we will use the short notation @xmath43 .",
    "the relations ( [ 2 ] ) allow to reduce the number of independent parameters of new physics .",
    "the leading - order differential cross - section of the bhabha process depends on five different combinations of @xmath0 couplings : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "taking into account these correlations reduce them to three actual parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "as it will be shown , the factors at @xmath44 and @xmath45 are dominant .",
    "therefore , with a high accuracy the differential cross - section is a two - parametric function .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we showed for the processes @xmath3 , that the many - parametric differential cross section can be integrated over a special range of the scattering angles in order to select only one of the unknown parameters .",
    "it seems resonable to apply similar approach in order to measure separately the couplings @xmath44 and @xmath45 by using the differential cross - section of the bhabha process .",
    "such kind of observables can be fitted by means of treating of modern experimental data that provides the bounds on the low energy vector and the axial - vector @xmath0 couplings to electron .",
    "due to the mentioned above universality of the axial - vector coupling @xmath49 it is possible to compare the estimates derived in different independent processes .",
    "+    the contributions to the cross - section of the process @xmath50 in the so - called improved born approximation are described by the tree - level plus one - loop diagrams with the neutral vector boson exchange in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 channels .",
    "the virtual states of the abelian @xmath0 boson cause the differential cross - section to differ from its sm value : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55  scattering angle and we introduced the dimensionless couplings @xmath56 due to the correlations ( [ 2 ] ) the cross - section contains only three different combinations of the @xmath0 couplings @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the factors @xmath57 standing at them depend on the sm couplings and particle masses . for the purposes of the present investigation",
    "the values of running couplings were taken at @xmath16 gev .",
    "the dots in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) denote the neglected contributions of the box diagrams and diagrams describing emission of soft photons in the initial and final states .",
    "these terms can be estimated to be of the order of a few percents of the total and are inessential for what follows .",
    "the explicit expressions for the tree - level functions @xmath57 are adduced in the appendix .",
    "their plots are shown in fig .",
    "as it is seen , each factor is infinitely increasing at @xmath58 .",
    "this is caused by the photon exchange in the @xmath52-channel .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the @xmath30@xmath0 mixing is expressed in terms of the axial - vector coupling .",
    "so , it influences the factors @xmath59 and @xmath60 . without taking into consideration the correlations ( [ 2 ] ) the contribution of the mixing to the cross - section",
    "has the form @xmath61 the dimensionless function @xmath62 is adduced in the appendix . for definiteness",
    "we show its angular dependence at the center - of - mass energies 200 and 500 gev in fig .",
    "the factor @xmath62 is a non - zero quantity which is almost an energy - independent constant at @xmath63 .",
    "the contribution of the mixing ( [ 5 ] ) decreases when the center - of - mass energy grows . at lep2 energies the account of the @xmath30@xmath0 mixing plays an important role",
    "actually , because of the correlation ( [ 2 ] ) the mixing terms essentially influence the factors at axial - vector couplings in the cross - section .",
    "the abelian @xmath0 signal is charachterized by the value @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath59 corresponding to this number is close to zero almost in all @xmath65 interval and qualitatively distinguishable among the factors for other hypothetic values of @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . hence",
    ", it is impossible to search for the signals of the abelian @xmath0 boson omitting the @xmath0scalar coupling @xmath67 . setting @xmath67 to zero",
    ", one obtains @xmath68 which behavior does not reflect in general the virtual state under consideration .    in order to study the deviations from the sm cross - section inspired by the heavy virtual state of the abelian @xmath0 boson",
    ", we introduce the functions which are finite at all values of the scattering angle .",
    "they are determined by means of dividing the differential cross - section by some known monotonic function .",
    "the factor @xmath69 is positive monotonic function of @xmath65 plotted in fig . 4 for the center - of - mass energies @xmath70 and 500 gev .",
    "for intermediate energies the curves are in between these very close located curves ( in the chosen energy scale ) .",
    "this type of behavior is typical for all other functions .",
    "so , in what follows , as illustration , we shall present our results for these two energies .",
    "such a property allows one to choose @xmath69 as a normalization factor for the differential cross section .",
    "then the normalized differential cross - section reads @xmath71 and the normalized factors are shown in fig 5 .",
    "+    now these factors are finite at @xmath72 .",
    "each of them in a special way influences the differential cross - section .    1 .",
    "the factor at @xmath73 is just the unity .",
    "hence , the four - fermion contact coupling between vector currents , @xmath73 , determines the level of the deviation from the sm value .",
    "the factor at @xmath74 depends on the scattering angle in a non - trivial way .",
    "it allows to recognize the abelian @xmath0 boson , if the experimental accuracy is sufficient .",
    "the factor at @xmath75 results in small corrections .",
    "thus , effectively , the obtained normalized differential cross - section is a two - parametric function . in the next sections we introduce the observables to fit separately each of these parameters .",
    "to recognize the signal of the abelian @xmath0 boson by analyzing the bhabha process the differential cross - section deviation from the sm predictions should be measured with a good accuracy . at present , no such deviations have been detected at more than the 1@xmath4 cl .",
    "in this situation it is resonable to introduce integrated observables allowing to pick out @xmath0 signals by using the most effective treating of available data .",
    "the observables should be sensitive to the separate @xmath0 couplings .",
    "this admits of search for the @xmath0 signals in different processes as well as to perform global fits .",
    "the deviation of the normalized differential cross - section ( [ ncs ] ) is ( effectively ) the function of two parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "we are going to introduce the integrated observables which determine separately the four - fermion couplings @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "let us first proceed with the observable for @xmath73 .",
    "after normalization the factor at the vector - vector four - fermion coupling becomes the unity . whereas the factor at @xmath74 is a sign - varying function of the cosine of the scattering angle . as it follows from fig .",
    "3 , for the center - of - mass energy 200 gev it is small over the backward scattering angles .",
    "so , to measure the value of @xmath73 the normalized differential cross - section has to be integrated over the backward angles . for the center - of - mass energy 500 gev the factor at @xmath74 is already a non - vanishing quantity for the backward scattering angles .",
    "the curves corresponding to intermediate energies are distributed in between two these curves .",
    "since they are sign - varying ones at each energy point some interval of @xmath65 can be chosen to make the integral to be zero .",
    "thus , to measure the @xmath0 coupling to the electron vector current @xmath73 we introduce the integrated cross - section ( [ ncs ] ) @xmath76 where at each energy the most effective interval @xmath77 $ ] is determined by the following requirements :    1 .   the relative contribution of the coupling @xmath73 is maximal .",
    "equivalently , the contribution of the factor at @xmath74 is suppressed .",
    "the length @xmath78 of the interval is maximal .",
    "this condition ensures that the largest number of bins is taken into consideration .",
    "+    the relative contribution of the factor at @xmath73 is defined as @xmath79 and shown in fig . 6 as the function of the left boundary of the angle interval , @xmath80 , and the interval length , @xmath78 . in each plot",
    "the dark area corresponds to the observables which values are determined by the vector - vector coupling @xmath73 with the accuracy @xmath81 .",
    "the area reflects the correlation of the width of the integration interval @xmath78 with the choice of the initial @xmath80 following from the mentioned requirements . within this area",
    "we choose the observable which includes the largest number of bins ( largest @xmath78 ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath80 and @xmath78 are marked by the white dot on the plots in fig .",
    "as the carried out analysis showed , the point @xmath80 is shifted to the right with increase in energy whereas @xmath78 remains approximately the same .    from the plots it follows that the most efficient intervals are @xmath82 therefore the observable ( [ vobs ] )",
    "allows to measure the @xmath0 coupling to the electron vector current @xmath73 with the efficiency @xmath81 .",
    "in order to pick the axial - vector coupling @xmath74 one needs to eliminate the dominant contribution coming from @xmath73 . since the factor at @xmath73 in the @xmath83 equals unity , this can be done by summing up equal number of bins with positive and negative weights . in particular , the forward - backward normalized differential cross - section appears to be sensitive mainly to @xmath74 , @xmath84 the value @xmath85",
    "is determined by the number of bins included and , in fact , depends on the data set considered .",
    "the lep2 experiment accepted @xmath86 events with @xmath87 . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath88 for definiteness .",
    "the efficiency of the observable is determined as : @xmath89 it can be estimated as @xmath90 for the center - of - mass energy 200 gev and @xmath91 for 500 gev . to obtain this value we took typical @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the observable @xmath93 is mainly sensitive to the @xmath0 coupling to the axial - vector current @xmath74 .",
    "consider a usual situation when experiment is not able to recognize the angular dependence of the differential cross - section deviation from its sm value with the proper accuracy because of loss of statistics .",
    "nevertheless , a unique signal of the abelian @xmath0 boson can be determined . for this purpose the observables @xmath94 and @xmath95 must be measured . actually , they are derived from the normalized differential cross - section .",
    "if the deviation from the sm is inspired by the abelian @xmath0 boson both the observables are to be positive quantities simultaneously .",
    "this feature serves as the distinguishable signal of the abelian @xmath0 virtual state in the bhabha process for the lep2 energies as well as for the energies of future electron - positron colliders ( @xmath96 gev ) .",
    "the observables fix the unknown low energy vector and axial - vector @xmath0 couplings to the electron current .",
    "their values have to be correlated with the bounds on @xmath74 and @xmath73 derived by means of independent fits for other scattering processes .",
    "let us apply the introduced observables to analysis the experimental data on differential cross - sections of the bhabha scattering .",
    "the lep2 experiments have measured , in particular , the differential cross - section of this process at a number of energy points .",
    "both the final and preliminary data are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "these data provide an opportunity to estimate possible abelian @xmath0 virtual states .    in the present paper we take into consideration the differential cross - sections measured by the l3 collaboration at 183 - 189 gev , by the opal collaboration at 189 - 207 gev , as well as the cross - sections obtained by the delphi collaboration at energies 189 - 207 gev .",
    "first , we estimate the value of the vector coupling @xmath73 by using the observable ( [ vobs ] ) . at the lep2",
    "energies the appropriate interval of the angular integration of the normalized differential cross - section is @xmath97 . the results are shown in table [ tabl : fit ] as ` fit 1 ' .",
    "the l3 and opal collaborations demonstrate positive values of @xmath73 at the @xmath5 cl , whereas the delphi collaboration shows the @xmath2 positive deviation . to constrain the value of the @xmath0 mass by the derived bounds on the four - fermion coupling @xmath73",
    "some value of @xmath23 should be fixed .",
    "let us assume that the coupling @xmath23 is of order of sm gauge couplings , @xmath98 .",
    "then the combined value of @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath99 tev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mean values of @xmath73 are a little larger than those obtained for @xmath74 for @xmath3 processes @xcite .",

    "indeed , the lep2 data lead to the significant errors for @xmath74 of order @xmath160 ( see table [ tabl : fit ] ) .",
    "the mean values are negative numbers which are too large to be interpreted as a manifestation of some heavy virtual state beyond the energy scale of the sm .",

    "this parameter can be easily fitted . as it follows from table",
    "[ tabl : fit ] , the results are close to those based on the observable ( [ vobs ] ) for the vector coupling .",

    ", the value of @xmath74 is a large negative number with a significant experimental uncertainty .",
    "this can not be interpreted as a manifestation of some heavy virtual state beyond the energy scale of the sm .",
    "in the present paper we have introduced new observables for model - independent searches for the heavy abelian @xmath0 boson in the bhabha process at the energies of the lep and future linear electron - positron colliders .",
    "they are based on the specific correlations ( [ 2 ] ) existing at low energies between the vector and the axial - vector @xmath0 couplings to fermions and therefore uniquely identify this virtual state .",

    "just the sign of the observable serves as the signal of the abelian @xmath0 in this case .",
    "the following estimate has been derived : @xmath174 the dimensionless coupling @xmath175 is related to @xmath176 by means of eq .",
    "( [ 3a ] ) and actually identical to the parameter @xmath177 admitted in the present paper .",

    "is concerned , it remained completely unrestricted in that case because of the kinematics specifics .",
    "thus , the results derived in the present paper from the analysis of the bhabha process are complementary .",
    "we see also that the accuracy of the result is of @xmath2 cl vs. @xmath5 for @xmath180 .",
    "there is a simple relation of the parameters @xmath177 , @xmath181 used in the present paper to the four - fermion couplings @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 admitted in the reports of the electroweak working group @xcite .",
    "they are just normalized by different factors and related as @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 .",
    "the description of the abelian @xmath0 virtual state in the bhabha process requires both @xmath184 and @xmath182 .",
    "none of these couplings should be set to zero in searching for @xmath0 signals .",
    "the separate constraints on @xmath184 or @xmath182 could be performed by means of observables @xmath188 and @xmath95 .",
    "let us confront our results with that in ref .",
    "@xcite where the ` helicity model fit ' was applied for the total cross sections of the bhabha process .",
    "the most interesting result of that analysis is the observation that for the aa - model the @xmath2 deviation from the sm has been derived . for other ` models ' no distinguishable deviations",
    "were observed . since our analysis",
    "is based on the properties of differential cross sections , no direct comparisons can be done .",
    "we just mention that in the paper @xcite we showed that the aa - helicity model is mainly responsible for the signal of the abelian @xmath0 gauge boson .",
    "so , one may speculate that this fact found its implementation in the significant @xmath2 deviations .    as a general conclusion we would like to stress that the observables to search for the abelian @xmath0 signal in bhabha process can be introduced at the lep2 energies ( @xmath189 gev ) as well as at the energies of future electron - positron colliders ( @xmath190 gev ) .",
    "they are determined by normalized differential cross - section and measure two sign - definite @xmath0 couplings , @xmath191 and @xmath49 .",
    "the positive signs of the observables are the characteristic feature of the abelian @xmath0 virtual state .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath0 couplings could be compared with those obtained in other independent scattering processes .    in the bhabha process",
