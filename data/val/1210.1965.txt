    "when a fireball produced in heavy - ion collisions is studied in an azimuthal angle , it is very useful to parametrize its initial shape with the help of the fourier decomposition ollitrault:1992bk , ackermann:2000tr , voloshin:2008dg .",
    "this decomposition clarifies trends in the elliptic flow , the fluctuations in elliptic flow , and the higher harmonics flows , which are associated with the triangularity and other shape parameters of the fireball alver:2010gr , teaney:2010vd .",
    "the harmonic analysis gives important information about the transverse initial conditions in heavy - ion collisions , and the mechanism of the subsequent evolution of the produced fireball ",
    "e.g. _ florkowski : book .",
    "in particular , the success of the hydrodynamic model in describing the @xmath2 data at rhic and lhc places new constraints on the initial conditions in the transverse direction .    a similar idea can be applied to study the shape of the fireball in the longitudinal direction . in this paper",
    "we will focus on rapidity , @xmath3 , but our arguments hold for any longitudinal variable .",
    "this study was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) where it was argued that long - range rapidity correlations can be interpreted in terms of the fluctuating rapidity density of the created fireball . when applied to the star data @xcite , a significant asymmetric component in the fireball s rapidity shape was found in the most central au+au collisions .    in this paper",
    "we extend the discussion presented in ref .",
    "we demonstrate that the fluctuations in the fireball rapidity density result in a nontrivial structure of the rapidity correlation function , and propose to study the additional components beyond asymmetry described above . the experimental method to extract various components",
    "is also discussed .",
    "the structure of this paper is following . in the next section",
    "we discuss the problem in a simple model .",
    "we show that an event - by - event difference between the number of wounded nucleons in the target and the projectile results in a long - range asymmetry of the fireball .",
    "we derive the correlation function and show that it depends on both the rapidity difference and the rapidity sum . in section 3 , we decompose the different components of the fireball rapidity density with chebyshev polynomials , and show how to extract the strength of these components from the measured rapidity correlation function . the practical application of this idea is discussed in section 4 , where we also include several comments .",
    "we summarize our paper with the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this section we explicitly demonstrate in a simple model that an event - by - event global fluctuations of the fireball rapidity shape lead to a nontrivial two - particle rapidity correlation function .    for a given heavy ion event , we denote the number of wounded nucleons moving to the left and to the right with @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the average over many events will be denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in collisions characterized by @xmath8 , the single particle rapidity distribution is asymmetric with respect to @xmath9 , where @xmath3 represents the rapidity in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "this asymmetry is clearly evident in d+au collisions as measured at rhic @xcite , and is easily reproduced by practically all models of heavy - ion collisions ",
    "see _ e.g. _",
    "bialas:2007eg , deng:2010mv , tribedy:2011aa , bozek:2011if .",
    "in symmetric heavy ion collisions ( au+au for example ) we have @xmath10 , and the single particle rapidity distribution is obviously symmetric with respect to @xmath9 @xcite . however , this distribution is symmetric only when averaged over many events . in a single event",
    "the shape ( in rapidity ) of the fireball may be asymmetric since @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , in a single event the number of wounded nucleons going to the left may differ from the number of wounded nucleons going to the right .",
    "as discussed below , the asymmetry can be quantified by @xmath12 , which is significantly larger than zero in au+au collisions .",
    "it is a useful exercise to calculate in a simple model the two - particle rapidity correlation function originating from fluctuations in @xmath13 .",
    "here we consider the wounded nucleon model @xcite , which is a very useful model for understanding many features of heavy - ion data bialas:2004su , bialas:2007eg , bzdak:2009dr . to simplify our considerations ,",
    "let us assume that the single particle rapidity distribution measured in d+au collisions can be approximated by a liner function of rapidity .",
    "consequently the distribution from a single wounded nucleon is also a linear function of rapidity . in the wounded nucleon model , the single particle distribution at a given @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "is given by bialas:2004su@xmath16where @xmath17 is the rapidity distribution from a right - mowing wounded nucleon , and @xmath18 is the contribution form a left - mover . as seen from above equation we have an asymmetric component that is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "assuming further that at a given @xmath14 and @xmath15 there are no correlations in the system , the two - particle rapidity distribution at a given @xmath14 and @xmath15 is@xmath19summing eq .",
    "( [ ro2lr ] ) over @xmath14 and @xmath15 with an appropriate probability distribution , @xmath20 , we obtain the experimentally accessible two - particle rapidity distribution . taking @xmath21 , corresponding to symmetric au+au collisions , we obtain@xmath22consequently , the two - particle rapidity correlation function reads @xmath23 + y_{1}y_{2}b^{2}\\left\\langle w_{-}^{2}\\right\\rangle ,   \\label{c}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as seen from eq .",
    "( c ) the fluctuations in @xmath13 result in a nontrivial rapidity structure of the two - particle correlation function .",
    "@xmath27 depends not only on the rapidity difference , @xmath28 , but also on the rapidity sum , @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the correlation function @xmath30decreases as a function of rapidity difference , @xmath31 , and increases as a function of rapidity sum , @xmath32 .",
    "this dependence on @xmath33 can distinguish fluctuations of the fireball shape from well known sources of correlations ( such as resonance decays ) that depend mainly on @xmath34 .",
    "( [ c ] ) should be taken as an illustration of the problem we would like to adress in this paper . despite its simplicity , the model result shows quite convincingly that the event - by - event asymmetry of the fireball shape that is present in symmetric heavy - ion collisions can lead to interesting rapidity correlations @xcite .",
    "obviously there can be more complicated sources of this asymmetry in more realistic models , _",
    "e.g. _ the difference in the number of flux - tubes in the cgc / glasma approach @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_a ] we present @xmath35 divided by the total number of wounded nucleons @xmath36 .",
    "we performed our calculations at @xmath37 gev in au+au and p+au collisions in the monte - carlo glauber model .",
    "gev as a function of the impact parameter @xmath38.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]   gev as a function of the impact parameter @xmath38.,title=\"fig:\",height=235 ]    it is interesting to notice that @xmath12 in au+au collisions is quite large and comparable in magnitude to the total number of wounded nucleons .",
    "thus , event - by - event rapidity fluctuations are of order @xmath39 compared to the average , and this is large compared to normal statistical fluctuations of order @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of particles .    in the next section",
    "we generalize eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) to analyze arbitrary rapidity fluctuations of the fireball shape .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the asymmetric component of the fireball rapidity density , originating from a non - zero values of @xmath42 . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ rolr ] ) for the simple model of the previous section , the single particle rapidity distribution at a given @xmath13 is proportional to rapidity @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ the fireball is denser on one side of the rapidity window than on the other .",
    "there may be different sources of this asymmetry such as the left - right difference in the number of collisions , or the difference in the number of asymmetric long - range flux - tubes in the cgc / glasma approach @xcite .",
    "let us denote the parameter that characterizes this asymmetry by @xmath43 . in our simple model , @xmath44 .",
    "equation ( [ rolr ] ) also contains a term that is proportional to the total number of wounded nucleons .",
    "fluctuations of this quantity lead to symmetric , rapidity independent , fluctuations of the _ whole _ fireball .",
    "this can naturally originate from impact parameter fluctuations , which are always present in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the parameter that characterizes this source of fluctuation . in our simple model , @xmath46 .",
    "the natural question arises if there are more components in the fluctuating shape of the fireball .",
    "for example , a `` butterfly '' component would characterize a symmetric fireball with higer ( or lower ) density on both sides of the midrapidity region , and lower ( or higher ) density at mid - rapidity .",
    "the single particle rapidity distribution affected by this component would be proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath48 the parameter that characterizes the strength of this effect .",
    "we will parametrize the fireball asymmetry and the butterfly component with the two chebyshev polynomials , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cheb ] .",
    "similarly , we can introduce additional components to fully parametrize shape fluctuations in rapidity .",
    "thus , it is tempting to expand the single particle rapidity distribution at a given @xmath51 in terms of the orthogonal polynomials@xmath52 ,   \\label{ro - an}\\]]where @xmath53 is the single particle distribution averaged over @xmath54 .",
    "here we have expanded the distribution in chebyshev polynomials @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 etc . ] , but other choices are certainly possible .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 characterizes the scale of long - range rapidity fluctuations in the system .",
    "we will discuss reasonable values of @xmath58 in the next section .",
    "averaging both sides of eq .",
    "( [ ro - an ] ) over @xmath51 with an appropriate probability distribution , @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 for all @xmath61 .    assuming that at a given @xmath51 there are no other large sources of long - range rapidity correlations , the two - particle rapidity distribution is@xmath62taking an average over @xmath63 and subtracting @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the two - particle rapidity correlation function@xmath65 \\ , .",
    "\\label{c - gen}\\]]it is useful to recall the physical meaning of the first few terms in eq .",
    "( c - gen ) : @xmath66 represents the rapidity independent fluctuations of the fireball as a whole , @xmath67 describes the correlation between rapidity independent fluctuations of the fireball and its asymmetry , @xmath68 is the asymmetric component discussed in the previous section , and @xmath69[2\\left ( y_{2}/y\\right ) ^{2}-1]$ ] represents the butterfly contribution , _",
    "etc._.    from the previous section , we know that the asymmetric component , @xmath70 , introduces a long - range rapidity correlation that is a decreasing function of the rapidity difference , @xmath28 , and an increasing function of the rapidity sum , @xmath29 .",
    "it is a straightforward to verify that the rapidity structure originating from the butterfly component leads to a correlation function that is decreasing both in @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    to conclude this section",

    "\\label{aiak}\\ ] ] in the next section we will discuss how eq .",
    "( [ aiak ] ) can be used in practice .",
    "in this section we list several comments to clarify the analysis presented in this paper . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ c - gen ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , we assumed that at a given @xmath51 there are no correlations in the system .",
    "in other words , the only sources of correlations are fluctuations in the fireball rapidity density .",
    "unfortunately , short - range correlations may contribute to the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c - gen ] ) , and contaminate the signal coming from the shape fluctuations .",
    "particularly problematic may be the correlations from resonance decays and local local charge conservation schlichting:2010qia , bozek:2012en .",
    "these problems can be mitigated by studying eq .",
    "( c - gen ) for positive and negative particles separately , which significantly reduces these unwanted backrounds .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the correlation function on the rapidity sum , @xmath32 , can be used to distinguish between rapidity density fluctuations and the short - range correlations of the background .",
    "one could also worry that at a given @xmath25 the distribution of final particles is given approximately by a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) @xcite which introduces long - range rapidity correlations into the system .",
    "this concern is unfounded , however , because the nbd leads to the following two - particle rapidity distribution.]@xmath79where @xmath80 measures deviation from poisson distribution . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ c - gen ] ) , the nbd @xmath81 influences only @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , this is the expected result , since the nbd can be viewed as a rapidity independent fluctuation of the whole fireball .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , it is not obvious what is the appropriate value of @xmath58 in the preceding formulas .",
    "clearly , @xmath58 parametrizes the range of global rapidity fluctuations in the fireball density .",
    "for instance , at @xmath37 gev the single particle distribution in d+au collisions @xcite is approximately linear as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath83 .",
    "thus , for the asymmetric component parametrized by @xmath43 , @xmath84 is a reasonable choice . for higher and lower energies",
    ", this parameter can be rescaled by the ratio of beam rapidities .",
    "this value of @xmath58 roughly corresponds to the size of the thermal fireball , and it is plausible that higher components , if they exist , are present in this region . if the measurement is performed in the smaller window than @xmath85 $ ] , fitting the measured correlation function with eq .",
    "( [ c - gen ] ) can determine the parameters of interest , @xmath71 .",
    "another choice is to assign @xmath58 to the rapidity interval of the measurement , and to investigate how the components @xmath86 change when this rapidity scale is varied .",
    "it is possible that the different fluctuating components are visible at different rapidity scales , and a systematic study of this sort can sort out these differences .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare the strengths of different components , @xmath71 , between heavy - ion and proton - proton collisions .",
    "this could reveal interesting differences in the longitudinal initial conditions between these two systems .",
    "for instance , in ref . @xcite it was shown that the asymmetric component is significantly stronger in p+p collisions than in central au+au collisions .",
    "further , the ideas presented in this paper could be extended by incorporating the multi - bin analysis proposed in refs .",
    "this multi - bin analysis can be used to investigate the different sources of particles production , providing a detailed picuture of the fireball in the longitudinal direction .",
    "finally , we point out that the results obtained in this paper can be easily generalized to three- and many - particle correlation functions .",
    "in conclusion , we showed that event - by - event fluctuations of the fireball rapidity density introduce interesting rapidity correlations that depend both on the rapidity difference , @xmath87 and the rapidity sum , @xmath88 .",
    "we demonstrated this explicitly in the wounded nucleon model , where an event - by - event difference between the number of wounded nucleons in a target and a projectile , @xmath13 , leads to the long - range asymmetry of the fireball .",
    "the resulting correlation function in symmetric a+a collisions is given in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "we further proposed to expand the measured two - particle rapidity correlation function in a series of the chebyshev polynomials ( see eq .",
    "( [ c - gen ] ) ) , where each polynomial represents a different component of the fireball s fluctuating rapidity density .",
    "the quadratic polynomial in this expansion describes the `` butterfly '' fluctuations described above , which are suggested by recent measurements at rhic .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion , @xmath89 , characterize the strength of various components , and we propose to extract these coefficients from the measured correlation function .",
    "this can reveal nontrivial information about the structure of the fireball in the longitudinal direction , and can test various models of particle production in hadronic collisions .",
