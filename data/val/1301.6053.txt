    "bloch oscillating transistor ( bot ) was initially conceived as a quasiparticle to n cooper pairs converter in which the current gain @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized that incoherent tunneling plays a crucial role and coherent bloch oscillations were impossible to reach without a resistive environment which was unrealistic from technological point of view @xcite . in regular bot devices , substantial current gains ( @xmath4 ) have been hard to achieve @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that large @xmath5-values can be obtained in devices whose characteristics are close to bistable behavior @xcite .",
    "the base current can have two different steady - state values in the hysteretic regime and , consequently , the onset of hysteresis corresponds to a bifurcation point where the current gain of the device diverges .",
    "the applications of a bot are expected to be mostly in metrology @xcite , dealing with source resistances of a few m@xmath1 at low frequencies below 1 khz @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable features of all bots is that they may operate below the shot noise limit as clearly demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where a suppression factor of 4 was reached at base current 60 pa and input referred current noise , @xmath6 fa/@xmath7 was obtained . in this work",
    "we further suppress the shot noise by choosing to work with bot devices in which the onset of hysteresis can be tuned at small base currents . when operated near the onset of hysteresis ,",
    "the regular current amplifier description is insufficient with realistic source impedances as the input impedance and the optimum noise impedance are also expected to diverge along with current gain @xcite .",
    "hence , the relevant figures of merit are the transconductance gain and the voltage noise which are experimentally characterized in the present work .",
    "one of the challenges of high - sensitivity , low - noise measurements is their susceptibility against external perturbations . as a consequence ,",
    "differential amplifier stages are commonly preferred since they can eliminate common mode disturbances and detect only the differential signal from the source . in this paper",
    ", we also study the applicability of bots for differential measurements .",
    "we have connected two bots in a manner where we have been able to bias them separately with opposite bias voltages ( currents ) and measure the sum and difference signals in current and transconductance gain modes while changing the common mode ( cm ) signal , either voltage or current .",
    "we characterize the results in terms of common mode rejection ratio ( cmrr ) which is found to be 20 db even without properly optimizing the operating point in a slightly asymmetric device .",
    "moreover , we compare the noise properties of the bot in current and transconductance gain modes .",
    "the bot samples employed in this work were fabricated on oxidized si substrates .",
    "lor 3b was spun at 2000 rpm for 60s and baked on hot plate at 150 c for 10 mins .",
    "we repeated it for two times which gives total thickness of lor of @xmath8 800 nm .",
    "20 nm thick ge was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.3  / s .",
    "pmma was spun at 4000 rpm on ge layer followed by baking for 3 mins at 170 c. rate of deposition of ge and baking of pmma found to be two important factors which play a role to generate cracks in ge film .",
    "the bot structures were patterned on this layer using e - beam lithography at 20 kev .",
    "after pattering the chips were subjected to mibk : ipa ( 1:3 ) solution for developing , followed by reactive ion etching with @xmath9 plasma to etch away the ge through the pmma window .",
    "finally , the lor under the germanium was etched in oxygen plasma up to the desired extent of undercut in an inductively coupled plasma etcher with temperature control for the substrate holder .",
    "shadow angle evaporation at four different angles was employed to generate the structures consisting of three metals .",
    "the process order in the evaporation sequence was ( ) chromium , ( ) aluminum , ( ) oxidization , ( ) aluminum , and ( ) copper .",
    "oxidation was done in ar : o@xmath10 ( 6:1 ) mixture at 80 mtorr for 1 min .",
    "nmp or pg remover was used for lift - off .    in short , al-@xmath11-al squid forms the emitter electrode while a cr thin film resistor works as the collector , and normal metal - insulator - superconductor ( nis ) junction corresponds to the base . even though the nominal process parameters for the bots on the same chip were equal , the characteristics of the individual devices varied substantially , as can be seen from table [ botparams ] which summarizes the parameters for the measured differential pair .",
    "the underlying cause is attributed to the nonuniform bending of the ge mask after the etching that was employed to create the undercut . due to this reason ,",
    "angle evaporation of different metals did not give exactly identical sample structures among all the samples on the chip .",
    "lllllllll bot # & @xmath12&@xmath13&@xmath14 & @xmath15&@xmath16 + 1 & 53 & 27 & 550 & 17 & 40 + 2 & 123 & 19 & 660 & 18 & 45 +      the measurements were done on a plastic dilution refrigerator ( pdr-50 ) from nanoway ltd .",
    "the base temperature of the refrigerator was 50 mk .",
    "the filtering in the pdr consisted of 70 cm long thermocoax cables on the sample holder and 1 k@xmath1 series resistors at 1.5 k. also , microwave filters from mini - circuits ( blp 1.9 ) were used at the top of the cryostat in the bias lines .",
    "the electronic temperature , deduced from the @xmath17 characteristics , turned out to be 150 mk , which is presumably due to joule - heating of the extremely thin cr resistors .",
    "aluminum bonding wires were used to connect the e , b and c ( see fig . [ botschema ] ) contact - pads to the sample holder .",
    "surface - mount , metallic thin film resistors of @xmath18 k@xmath1 ( 510 k@xmath1 at 100 mk ) were soldered on the sample holder itself ; the whole configuration was cooled to base temperature to minimize the thermal noise coming from the resistors @xmath19 .",
    "two @xmath19s were connected to common - mode port with thin copper wire . in the transconductance @xmath20 and input impedance measurements @xmath21 , we measured the current through @xmath19 , which allowed us to determine the current division of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the base .",
    "knowledge on the division allowed us to determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the bots simultaneously .",
    "the base electrodes of the bots were dc biased , either by current or voltage depending on the configuration on the cm port .",
    "base currents were fed via equally large resistors @xmath26 g@xmath1 , located at room temperature .",
    "ground contact at the other end of @xmath19 converted the current bias into voltage bias .",
    "voltages at the base and at the collector were tracked by li-75a amplifiers while currents were measured using dl1211 preamplifiers . for noise measurement ,",
    "sr780 spectrum analyzer was employed .",
    "first , we characterized both samples in the current bias mode and measured the current gain ( @xmath27 ) on the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 plane .",
    "similar cross - over curve between stable and bistable operation was observed as found in ref .",
    "@xcite . near the bifurcation point ,",
    "large gains were obtained and we chose to operate in a regime where the cross - over curve is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath29 , which was expected to improve the long term stability of the cmrr measurement .",
    "close to the divergence point , it is also easy to tune the current gains to @xmath30 for the cmrr measurement .",
    "unfortunately , when the cm port was fed using current , the cmrr was found to be poor .",
    "this was traced back to the difference in @xmath31 values of the bots , because an equally large relative difference is there in the input impedances as @xmath32 .",
    "the main obstacle in balancing between @xmath24 values is the variation in the @xmath8 6.5 nm thick chromium resistor which is difficult to control within a few percent in our lithographic process .",
    "therefore , the common mode current is divided unevenly between the bots and no proper cancellation is achieved .",
    "hence , we conclude that the operation of a differential bot pair is more difficult in current gain mode than in transconductance regime where it is sufficient to match just the gains .",
    "second , we grounded the resistors @xmath19 and traced out the transconductances of the two bots ( @xmath33 g@xmath1 ) . in order to measure @xmath25 along the whole @xmath34 characteristics",
    ", we traced @xmath35 using different values for @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath36 was calculated by subtracting two @xmath37 traces for two different base currents , whereas @xmath38 was determined from the change in the division of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "[ cmdata]a shows the measured @xmath25 for both bots plotted against voltage @xmath39 .",
    "the absolute maximum value of transconductance peaks appear in the negative resistance regime of @xmath34 curves .",
    "the maximum for @xmath25 is found to vary from 2 @xmath40s to 9 @xmath40s in the present samples which corresponds to @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "this coincides well with the simulations of ref .",
    "the transconductance was recorded across the hysteretic point of the current gain , but no abrupt change was found in @xmath25 .",
    "this finding reflects the fact that both @xmath24 and @xmath5 diverge and @xmath43 @xcite .    for a differential bot",
    "we define the signal to be the emitter difference current of the bots . in a realistic configuration",
    "the post - amplification could be arranged , e.g. , by transforming the currents to magnetic fluxes with opposite polarities in a squid postamplifier .",
    "thus we can define the cmrr as @xmath44 when the magnitude of the base bias voltage is the same .",
    "due to opposite bias in the non - hysteretic regime ( @xmath45 ) we can have @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "if @xmath49 , @xmath50 would be fully independent of the common mode signal and cmrr = @xmath51 .    fig .",
    "[ cmdata]b shows one example of the effect of @xmath52 on the output current @xmath50 . in this case , the two bots were biased at the points where they have almost equal magnitude of transconductance , @xmath53 @xmath40s and @xmath54 @xmath40s , but the values of which may increase slightly with @xmath55 .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath55 is varied , @xmath56 changes rather weakly , and the straight line in fig .",
    "[ cmdata]b yields a cmrr value of 20 db .",
    "we also performed equivalent input noise measurements on bots in the transconductance mode , connected to a 510 k@xmath1 source impedance .",
    "since the source impedance is clearly less than the impedance for noise optimum , we are mostly sensitive to the voltage noise generator of the amplifier . fig .",
    "[ noiseintrans ] shows the noise spectral density on the emitter terminal under current and voltage biased conditions .",
    "[ noiseintrans]a displays the input referred current noise when the device is used as a current amplifier .",
    "the blue trace is at the operating point with @xmath57 .",
    "the bandwidth was found to be @xmath8 20 hz , which is consistent with the @xmath58 input time constant with @xmath59 10 m@xmath1 .",
    "the input referred current noise exceeds @xmath60 below 10 hz , which indicates slightly more @xmath61 noise compared with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the equivalent input voltage noise @xmath62 in the transconductance mode is displayed in fig .",
    "[ noiseintrans]b .",
    "we find @xmath63 10 nv/@xmath7 at the maximum @xmath64 @xmath40s .",
    "the bandwidth is around 200 hz which is limited by the output impedance of @xmath65 k@xmath66 .",
    "simultaneously with these noise measurements , we determined the input impedance and obtained @xmath24 = 6 m@xmath1 . using the obtained @xmath62 and @xmath24",
    ", we estimate for the optimum impedance @xmath67=5 - 10 m@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath67 arises from the different operating conditions in the determination of @xmath62 and @xmath68 . in order to deduce @xmath67",
    "we have made the assumption that the equivalent input noise of the bot near the bistability point is governed by the output switching noise , which allows scaling of the noise sources between different conditions .",
    "this estimate for optimum impedance supports the theoretical result @xmath69 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the transconductance mode",
    "the output current noise is @xmath70 100 fa/@xmath7 , which sets the criterion for the post - amplification .",
    "this requirement can be met , e.g. , with squid - based post - amplifier @xcite . within the source resistance range 1 m @xmath1 @xmath71 , the bot transconductance amplifier over - performs squid - based amplifiers as @xmath72 is in the range of 1 - 10 fa/@xmath7 , i.e. , lower than the current noise of the state - of - the - art squid ammeters at low frequencies .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed transconductance ( current gain ) , voltage noise ( current noise ) , and input impedance measurements in voltage ( and current ) biased , galvanically coupled bloch oscillating transistors in a differential pair configuration . we found that biasing with voltage works better for the cmrr measurement , providing easily a rejection ratio of 20 db .",
    "the superiority of the transconductance mode is attributed to the fact that it is then sufficient to match just the @xmath25-values of the two amplifiers , while careful matching of @xmath24 in addition to gain @xmath5 is necessary in the current gain mode . in the transconductance mode",
    ", we find for the input referred voltage noise @xmath73 nv/@xmath7 at @xmath74 @xmath40s and @xmath75 m@xmath1 , with the @xmath61 corner frequency at around 5 hz .",
    "altogether , we can say that by matching the @xmath25 values of the two bots closer to each other coupled bots will make an excellent candidate for a transconductance amplifier in metrological cryogenic applications .",
