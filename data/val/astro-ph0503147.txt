    "astrophysical high - energy particles manifest as cosmic rays or , indirectly , as radio waves , x - rays , gamma rays .",
    "these often occur in transients , and with distinctly non - equilibrium energy distributions .",
    "a prominent source of sporadic radio- and x - ray emission is the sun during the active phase of its 11-year cycle . among the numerous mechanisms proposed for accelerating solar particles to high energies ( see @xcite for an overview ) , stochastic ones attracted particular attention because they require generic input data and do not rely on special geometrical assumptions . in stochastic acceleration @xcite ,",
    "particles move in random electromagnetic fields , where they become repeatedly deflected and , on average , accelerated .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are thought to arise from magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , perhaps excited by the broadband echo of a magnetic collapse .",
    "the turbulence may host shocks and other forms of dissipation if critical velocities @xcite or electric current densities @xcite are exceeded .",
    "associated with dissipation are ( collisional or anomalous ) resistivity and non - conservative electric fields , which sustain , locally , the electric current against dissipative drag in order to meet the global constraints .",
    "however , a detailed balance on the level of individual charge carriers is impossible because the dissipative drag depends on particle position _ and _ velocity , whereas the electric field is a function of position only .",
    "thus the electric field may compensate the bulk drag , but a ( high - energy ) population can be left over and exposed to acceleration @xcite .",
    "this lack of detailed balance is in the heart of dissipative acceleration mechanisms . in plasmas",
    ", dissipation occurs at ` ruptures ' of the magnetic structure , and is therefore localized around critical points of the magnetic field .",
    "the above scenario , first envisaged by parker @xcite for the solar atmosphere , has since been explored in a large number of numerical studies @xcite . on the theoretical side , most stochastic acceleration theories @xcite base on fokker - planck approaches , thus transferring two - point functions of the electromagnetic fields into drift and diffusion coefficients of particles by probing the fields along unperturbed trajectories .",
    "dynamical particle averages are then replaced by field ensemble averages , neglecting the fact that real particles move in _ one _ realization of the random field . as a result , diffusive behaviour",
    "may be predicted even if particles are trapped in a single realization of the random field .    in order to investigate the full diversity of orbit behaviour one must resort to numerical simulations . in the present contribution",
    "we analyze the behaviour of test particles in resistive mhd turbulence with localized dissipation regions , with particular emphasis on the validity of a fokker - planck description @xcite .",
    "we use here exact orbit integration , and thus avoid any guiding centre approximations @xcite .",
    "the price for rigorosity is computational cost , which makes the scheme only feasible with the aid of high - performance computing .",
    "the mhd turbulence has been been modeled by full 3d spectral mhd simulations and by gauss field proxies @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the latter , which is computed from the vector potential @xmath1 = @xmath2 by means of tabulated trigonometric calls .",
    "this allows to continuously determine the fields at the exact particle position , and avoids any real - space discretization artifacts , but the computational overhead restricts the @xmath3 sum to a few 100 fourier modes @xmath4 .",
    "they are taken from the shell @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7@xmath6 @xmath8 with @xmath9 the rms thermal ion larmor radius and @xmath10 the outer scale of the power spectral density @xmath11 .",

    "equation ( [ mhd ] ) can be achieved in several ways .",
    "for instance , one can use euler potentials of which only one is time - dependent , or force @xmath20 to point along a single direction . a somewhat more flexible way , used here , is axial gauge @xmath23 = 0 with dispersion relation @xmath24 = @xmath25 . a constant magnetic field",

    "it was found that the electrons remain adiabatic ( during the duration of the simulation ) if no dissipation regions are encountered , and can become accelerated if such are met .",
    "the resulting acceleration is intermittent and is not well described by a diffusion process , even if the underlying electromagnetic fields are gaussian . on time scales which are large compared to the gyro time , the kinetic momentum performs a lvy flight rather than a classical brownian motion .",

    "the waiting times between subsequent encounters with dissipation regions are approximately exponentially distributed , @xmath118 , indicating that the dissipation regions are randomly placed along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this one - dimensional poisson behaviour is most likely caused by the gauss field approximation , and the waiting times in true mhd turbulence are expected to behave differently . an ongoing study is devoted to these questions , and results will be reported elsewhere . in summary ,",
    "our numerical results suggest that the acceleration process may be modeled by a continuous - time random walk with finite or infinite mean waiting time , and infinite variance of the momentum increments .",
