    "in 1988 , aharonov , albert , and vaidman introduced the idea of weak measurement  @xcite . for a very weak interaction between a system and measuring apparatus",
    ", they showed that the measurement results obtained can be much larger than the eigenvalues of the observable by selecting appropriate initial and final states .",
    "the counterintuitive results have been implemented in experiments  @xcite .",
    "weak measurement has provided a new perspective to the famous hardy s paradox  @xcite , and the illustrations have been realized in experiments  @xcite .",
    "using the idea of weak measurement , hosten and kwiat have observed the tiny spin hall effect of light  @xcite .",
    "this idea has also been used to amplify small transverse deflections and frequency changes of optical beams  @xcite .",
    "because of the importance of weak measurement in applications , there has been much research work on this issue  @xcite .    in the seminal paper  @xcite , aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) introduced the weak value @xmath0 of an observable @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the preselected and postselected states ( pps ) , respectively . for the interaction hamiltonian @xmath4 , and the weak value @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) , jozsa  @xcite has derived that the final mean pointer momentum and position satisfy @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the original mean pointer position and momentum , @xmath10 is the variance of position in the initial pointer state , and @xmath11 is the mass of the pointer .",
    "it seems that for @xmath12 , the shifts of the pointer s position and momentum might be arbitrarily large . in fact",
    "arbitrarily large shifts can not be obtained , as there is one approximation step in the derivation @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the original and final states of the measuring device . as pointed out in  @xcite",
    ", the validity of the approximation in the above equation requires that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . when @xmath12 , the above requirement is not satisfied , so the measurement results given by eq .",
    "( @xmath18 ) are not valid .",
    "thus , we need some more precise descriptions of weak measurements .",
    "there has been some research on weak measurements beyond aav s formalism  @xcite . by retaining the second order terms of @xmath19 ,",
    "the formalism of weak measurements is generalized to the general preselected and postselected states in  @xcite . in that reference",
    ", it was shown that the weak measurement outcomes can not increase arbitrarily by decreasing the overlap between the pps .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the shifts of the pointer position and momentum without any approximation .",
    "the interaction between the system and measuring device is not assumed to be very weak .",
    "so , the expressions we obtained are not only valid for the weak interaction cases , but also legitimate for the strong interaction cases .",
    "we also give the maximum shifts of the measuring device for the two - dimensional systems by choosing appropriate pps . using weak measurement , the improvements of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the enhancements of the measure sensitivity ( ms )",
    "are discussed in the paper .",
    "when we consider the probabilities reduced by postselection , we find the snr and ms can not be effectively improved in weak measurement .",
    "we also show that the snr and ms can be effectively improved without considering the probabilities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    ". ii we will give the general precise expressions of the pointer shifts .",

    "v. a short conclusion is presented in sec . vi .",
    "in this section , we derive the precise expressions of the measurement results with preselection and postselection , without any restriction on the strength of the interaction between the system and the measuring device .",
    "the preselected and postselected states of the quantum system are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath20 respectively , and the initial state of the measuring device is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the system and the device is described as @xmath21 where @xmath19 is the coupling strength with @xmath22 , @xmath1 is an observable of the quantum system , and @xmath23 is a variable of the measuring device . throughout this article , for the purpose of convenience , by @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ,",
    "we redefine @xmath1 and @xmath19 such that @xmath1 becomes a dimensionless operator with a unit norm .",
    "it is assumed that the complete orthonormal eigenstates of the observable @xmath1 are @xmath26 , the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath27 .",
    "so , the preselected state @xmath2 can be written as @xmath28 and the overall state of the system and measuring device is @xmath29 after the interaction described by eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) the overall state evolves into @xmath30 with @xmath31 throughout this paper .",
    "the postselected state can also be written as @xmath32 .",
    "after postselection , the final device state is @xmath33 which is not a normalized state .",
    "the probability of obtaining the final state @xmath15 is @xmath34 the expectation value of a pointer observable @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we have given the general and precise expression of the device s readings .",
    "without loss of generality , the initial state of the pointer device is assumed to be a gaussian wave function centered on @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the position and momentum variables , and the standard deviations of them are @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in this paper , we consider @xmath45 , and the interaction @xmath46 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : c3 ] ) , the final state of the pointer device after postselection is @xmath47 and the probability of obtaining the final state @xmath15 is @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( @xmath49 ) , we can directly calculate the expectation values of the pointer momentum and position @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the expectation values of the pointer momentum and position in the initial state are both zero , the values given in eqs .",
    "( @xmath52 ) and ( @xmath53 ) are also the average shifts of the pointer momentum and position , which are denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .    in the rest of this section ,",
    "we discuss two extreme cases in terms of the interaction strength : the weak interaction case and the strong interaction case .",
    "first , we discuss the weak interaction case ( i.e. , the coupling strength is weak @xmath56 ) .",
    "we have @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 if the real part of the weak value @xmath60 is big , the shift @xmath54 can be much larger than the shift of the pointer without postselection .",
    "this amplification effect is implemented in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the results in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c10 ] ) and ( [ eq : c11 ] ) are the same as those given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jozsa ] ) .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the approximation step may not be legitimate when @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in a general discussion without restriction on the overlap between preselection and postselection states , we use eqs .",
    "( @xmath52 ) and ( @xmath53 ) instead .",
    "next , we discuss the strong interaction case ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) .",
    "we have @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and then @xmath64 . if the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are nondegenerate , the shift of the pointer momentum can be approximately expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the state of the system after projection onto the eigenstates @xmath26 .",
    "when the eigenvalues are degenerate , let the eigenvalue @xmath67 be @xmath68-fold degenerate , we can re - label the eigenstates of @xmath1 as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "then the pps can be rewritten as @xmath71 and @xmath72 . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : c12 ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) are the results for a strong measurement , and they can be regarded as the ideal quantum measurement results which are independent of the device s states .",
    "so , we have got the ideal measurement results by increasing the strength of the interaction between the quantum system and measuring device . from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : c12 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , we can get that @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the observable @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the measurement results given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c13 ] ) mean that the amplification effect disappears when the interaction strength is strong .",
    "in this section , we derive the maximum shifts of the pointer position and momentum for a measurement with preselection and postselection on a qubit system .",
    "the interaction between the system and the measuring device is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 , which is not assumed to be weak unless specified . as the system to be measured is two - dimensional ,",
    "so the orthonormal eigenstates of the observable @xmath1 can be denoted as @xmath79 , and the corresponding eigenvalues are denoted as @xmath80 , respectively . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath81 . then the pps @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 . from eqs .",
    "( @xmath52 ) and ( @xmath53 ) , we get @xmath85 and @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "when the two states @xmath2 and @xmath88 are orthogonal to each other , we obtain that @xmath89 while aav s formalism can not give any measurement result for two orthogonal pps .",
    "now , for a given pointer state and coupling strength @xmath19 , we search for the extreme values of @xmath54 and @xmath90 over all the pps .",
    "let @xmath91 , from @xmath92 , we get @xmath93 , and @xmath94 where @xmath95 . by @xmath96 , we get the extreme values of the shift of the pointer momentum @xmath97 as @xmath81 , it is obtained that @xmath98 let @xmath99 and @xmath100 . when @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath54 reaches its minimum value @xmath103 ; when @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath54 reaches its maximum value @xmath106 , where @xmath95 . for the weak interaction case @xmath107",
    ", we have @xmath108 , the extreme shift is achieved when @xmath109 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath101 and @xmath109 imply @xmath12 .",
    "so for the weak interaction cases , the shift of the pointer reaches its extreme value when the pps are approximatively orthogonal .    furthermore , for the weak interaction cases with @xmath110 , we get @xmath111 and @xmath112 which only depend on the original state of the measuring device . for the strong interaction cases with @xmath61 , we get @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , which depend on the eigenvalues of @xmath1 and the coupling strength @xmath19 .    by a similar derivation , we obtain that @xmath115 the minimum shift @xmath116 of the pointer position is achieved when @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; while the maximum shift @xmath119 is achieved when @xmath117 and @xmath120 . for @xmath110 , @xmath121 , so the extreme shift of the pointer position is achieved only when @xmath12 . for the weak interaction cases",
    "@xmath110 , the minimum and maximum shifts of the pointer position are given by @xmath122 , and @xmath123 ; while for the strong interaction cases @xmath61 , we get @xmath124 .    here , we have obtained the extreme values of the pointer s",
    "shifts for all pps . when @xmath110 , we find that the maximum shifts are independent of the coupling strength @xmath19 , and by choosing the appropriate pps , the maximum values of pointer shifts @xmath125 and @xmath126 can be obtained .",
    "so for the weak interaction case , due to the postselection , the signal is amplified by a factor of @xmath127 which could be very large . when @xmath61 , it is obtained that @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and these results mean that there is no amplification effect at all under the strong interaction circumstance .",
    "now we consider the stern - gerlach experiment which is widely discussed in weak measurements  @xcite . in this experiment , spin-@xmath130 particles with the spin pointed in the direction @xmath131 travel through an inhomogeneous ( in the @xmath132 direction ) magnetic field , and",
    "then are postselected in the @xmath133 direction .",
    "so , we have @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the initial pointer state is @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a normalized wave function .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 depends on the magnetic field .",
    "after postselection , the final pointer state is @xmath140 substituting @xmath15 into eq .",
