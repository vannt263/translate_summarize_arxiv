    "in the presence of noise and perturbations , the information stored in quantum systems is typically lost . indeed , orthogonal states ( or their superpositions )",
    "may evolve into similar states , so that even when the perturbation is known it is impossible to restore the original one .",
    "@xcite however , the rate at which information corrupts depends on how it is actually encoded , on the nature of the perturbations , as well as on the properties of the system . in particular , in the case of a many - body system , this rate may depend on its size : for the larger hilbert space there is `` more space '' to keep the states distinguishable .",
    "systems possessing this property for naturally occurring perturbations may serve as quantum memories ,  @xcite which can reliably store quantum states for long times .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the capability of a kitaev chain  @xcite to store quantum states in the presence of noise .",
    "we consider the encoding of a qubit in the zero - energy majorana modes of a kitaev chain described by hamiltonian @xmath0 and analyze the loss of information occurring when the time evolution describing the storage period is dictated by a different hamiltonian , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an unknown perturbation .",
    "we explicitly focus on time - dependent quadratic perturbations containing high frequencies and find that the quantum memory can be robust to a wide range of perturbations .",
    "specifically , even though perturbations spread the qubit in the whole hilbert space and the average over several @xmath3 is considered , the orthogonality of any pair of initial states is preserved for very long times : the rate at which the information is lost decreases exponentially with the system size .",
    "the potential use as quantum memories of kitaev chains  @xcite and of other topological systems  @xcite has been extensively studied in recent years , following the seminal work by kitaev .",
    "@xcite most of the prior work has focused on analyzing systems with topological order , whereby the degeneracy of the ground state subspace is stable under small local perturbations  @xcite with frequencies well below the characteristic energy gap .",
    "this ensures that all of the ground states of the perturbed hamiltonian have a trivial evolution so that , when encoded in these ground states , the information can survive for long times .",
    "in contrast , here we consider the situation when highly excited states are created due to sudden quench perturbations with high - frequency excitations above the gap .",
    "@xcite in such cases , conventional topological protection is no longer effective .",
    "@xcite    our work is closely connected to the use of topological systems as error correcting codes in the context of self - protected quantum memories .",
    "@xcite however , in contrast to previous investigations , we do not consider a specific error correction procedure ,  @xcite but rather analyze whether the information is still present `` somewhere '' in the hilbert space .",
    "in fact , our analysis shows that the memory time grows exponentially with the system size in situations where previous approaches give a negative result .",
    "besides , our results may bear an interesting connection to the phenomenon of many - body localization  @xcite , whereby different initial states remain distinguishable for arbitrarily long times under a quench .    in this article",
    "we introduce a series of theoretical tools to analyze the loss of quantum information encoded in many - body systems and characterize the optimal procedure to decode it . in a quantum - memory framework , we quantify the amount of information that may be recovered after the storage period and evaluate it , as well as its upper and lower bounds , for different relevant cases . for the problem of interest",
    ", our numerical methods can investigate relatively large systems , and the appropriate size - scalings are derived .",

    "we consider a kitaev chain of @xmath4 majorana ( real ) modes , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian is :  @xcite @xmath8 at zero temperature , it has a topological phase for @xmath9 and the ground state is quasi - degenerate due to the existence of ( nearly ) zero energy majorana modes , @xmath10 , localized at the edges .",
    "they can be expressed as linear combinations of the @xmath11 , and can be used to define a dirac mode @xmath12 . due to superselection rules on the parity of the number of fermions , two such dirac modes",
    "are necessary in order to define a meaningful qubit .",
    "thus , we consider a second kitaev chain , whose zero - energy majorana modes are @xmath13 , and which define a dirac mode @xmath14 .",

    "is encoded into a topological system of size @xmath18 and stored for a time @xmath19 .",
    "perturbations act on the system during the storage and induce a non - unitary time - evolution that destroys the encoded information .",
    "we model this process with a decoherence channel @xmath20 .",
    "a recovery operation attempts at retrieving the information and reconstructs a qubit @xmath21 which should be as similar as possible to @xmath22 . ]    when the hamiltonian is perturbed or there is an interaction with the environment , the chain undergoes a non - trivial dynamics .",
    "let us denote by @xmath23 the _ decoherence channel _ that describes the encoding of a qubit into the ground state of the chains and the subsequent time - evolution which describes the storage of the information ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "note that the latter takes into account both the hamiltonian part of the time evolution and the non - unitary action of perturbations .",
    "the decoherence channel maps the state of the qubit onto the state of the two chains ; therefore , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a qubit density operator and @xmath26 is the state of the chains at time @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath27 thus represents the many - body state where the information is encoded and it must always fulfill @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the usual pauli matrices and the @xmath30 are defined in  . these conditions do not define @xmath27 uniquely ; where not explicitly stated , we will consider : @xmath31 where operators @xmath32 diagonalize the total hamiltonian and @xmath33 labels those modes which have non - zero energy ; @xmath34 is a properly chosen constant .    in order to simplify the discussion , we assume that the chains are kept far apart , so that they do not interact with each other or with the same environment .",
    "moreover , throughout the article we assume that the first dirac mode , @xmath35 , does not undergo any dynamics , neither hamiltonian nor dissipative , as in general only the relative time evolution of the two chains contributes to the corruption of the information . in this setting",
    "there is no need to keep track of the modes of the first chain different from @xmath35 .",
    "after the storage time @xmath19 , the attempt to retrieve the initial qubit is described by the _ recovery channel _ , @xmath36 , which maps back the chain and the extra fermionic mode , @xmath35 , to a qubit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "it has to be chosen such that the composite channel @xmath37 is as close as possible to the identity channel .",
    "this can be quantified with the _ recovery fidelity _ :  @xcite @xmath38 where the integral is over the surface of the bloch sphere .    in appendix  [ appendix1 ]",
    "we demonstrate that , given a decoherence channel , the optimal fidelity @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the ( pure ) eigenstates of @xmath43 with eigenvalues @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denotes the trace norm , i.e. the sum of the singular values of the operator .",
    ".   shows that @xmath39 depends on the distance @xmath46 between two many - body states which result from the time evolution of two orthogonal qubit states . at @xmath47 , @xmath48 but it decreases with time due to noise and perturbations , and no physical operation can increase it again because of the contractivity of the trace norm .",
    "@xcite    in appendix  [ appendix1 ] we also characterize the properties of the _ optimal recovery operation _ @xmath49 that saturates the bound @xmath50 of eq .  .",
    "this @xmath49 consists in the measurement on @xmath51 of three many - body observables @xmath52 , that ( i ) essentially undo the rotation that the axes of the original qubit @xmath53 have undergone , and ( ii ) quantify the distance between pairs of initially orthogonal states aligned on them .",

    "those actions depend on the specific experimental setup and should be independently studied for each physical implementation . here",
    "we consider as experimentally - relevant recovery operations those which are fermionic gaussian channels .",

[ ] ) .",
    "our analysis shows that , even if the standard techniques to correct errors fail , the qubit is still intact and can be recovered with the optimal recovery operation .",
