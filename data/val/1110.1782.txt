    "the presence of the thick disk component in the galaxy has been established for several decades @xcite .",
    "the age , metallicity and rotational velocity of thick disk stars have been investigated for various types of stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , the formation mechanism of the thick disk is not well known .",
    "actually , the metallicity gradient for the thick disk , being a basic input for the model of the galactic disk , is not well studied in the literature .",
    "to the contrary , the traditional radial metallicity gradient of the galactic thin disk is well investigated based on h@xmath9 regions , cepheids , ob stars , open clusters ( young population ) and planetary nebulae ( old population ) .",
    "it is found that the radial gradients vary with time in the sense of a steeper slope in the early stages compared to the present value , and there is a change in slope at large galactocentric distances @xmath10 kpc @xcite .",
    "generally , the thick disk is typical for vertical distances from the galactic plane of 0.5 to 1.5 kpc based on observational data in the solar neighborhood . with a large spectroscopic survey of stars far away from the sun",
    ", it is suggested that stars with @xmath6 kpc dominate the thick disk @xcite , and the edge of the thick disk could reach up to @xmath11 kpc .",
    "the large range in the @xmath12 distribution enables us to investigate the vertical metallicity gradient of the thick disk , which is not possible for the thin disk where most stars are located within @xmath13 kpc . such a study has recently begun and the existence of a metallicity gradient in the thick disk is a discrepant issue . for example , @xcite proposed no metallicity gradient in the thick disk for @xmath14 kpc with a upper limit on the gradient of 0.03 dex kpc@xmath4 , while @xcite investigated the metallicity distribution function ( hereafter mdf ) of the thin - thick - disk - halo system in two galactic directions for several intervals between 0 and 5 kpc above the galactic plane and detected a vertical metallicity gradient of @xmath15 dex kpc@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the thick disk presents no metallicity gradient .",
    "but some models with a gradient are compatible with observations of the thick disk dominated by a population with @xmath16 kpc as pointed out by @xcite . meanwhile , in an indirect way , the mean metallicity for the thick disk varies with different heights from @xmath17 at @xmath18 kpc @xcite , to @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath6 kpc @xcite , which may indicate the existence of a metallicity gradient .",
    "note that these works are mainly based on dwarf stars and they have limitations in some aspects .",
    "for example , @xcite have high resolution but low signal - to - noise data for low heights of @xmath18 kpc where both the thin and thick disks contribute significantly to the mdf . @xcite and",
    "@xcite were based on an sdss dr6 sample where metallicity on the metal rich side could be underestimated by 0.2 - 0.3 dex according to @xcite .",
    "@xcite are based on photometrically derived metallicities , which are not as good as spectroscopically derived values .",
    "recently , @xcite provide high quality data for the metallicity estimation , but the number of sample stars is limited to several hundreds .",
    "the aim of this work is to probe the metallicity gradient of the thick disk population using red horizontal branch ( hereafter rhb ) stars selected from sdss dr8 .",
    "this study has some advantages over previous studies .",
    "first , the number of stars in the sample is on the order of thousands , and the metallicity is based on the updated version in sdss dr8 .",
    "second , rhb stars are an interesting type of star , which are different from dwarf stars , with stellar distances easily obtained from their intrinsic absolute magnitude .",
    "their high brightness make them traceable to distances of up to 10 kpc .",
    "finally , we investigate the metallicity distributions for thick disk stars in five different directions in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "in particular , the comparison of the thick disk properties between the galactocenter and anti - galactocenter directions has great potential for providing more stringent data for model comparisons .",
    "thanks to the large survey area of the sdss project , it is the first time that such properties in different directions can be studied and they will provide important clues for our understanding of the thick disk formation .",
    "the selection procedure of rhb stars is similar to @xcite , but uses sdss dr8 @xcite rather than sdss dr7 @xcite . specifically , the first selection criterion is the color - metallicity relation of @xmath21}}+0.829 $ ] presented in @xcite with a deviation in @xmath22 to the above relation @xmath23",
    ". then stars with @xmath24 , @xmath2 } } > -2.0 $ ] and signal - to - noise ratios of their spectra larger than 10 are used to obtain good quality data .",
    "thirdly , rhb stars should have stellar parameters within the range of 45005900k in temperature and 1.83.5 dex in @xmath25 . in the selection ,",
    "photometric data and stellar parameters ( including metallicities ) in photometric and spectroscopic star tables of dr8 are adopted .",
    "stellar distances of stars are calculated from @xmath26 magnitudes and the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation of @xmath27}}+1.39 $ ] derived by @xcite with metallicities taken from the sdss dr8 spectroscopic star table .",
    "the stellar distance and position on the sky is then converted to the cartesian system of galactic coordinates ( x , y , z ) .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the photometric data and stellar parameters are updated in dr8 along with an enlarged survey area in the disk .",
    "both improvements provide a better chance for us to probe the thick disk properties . with the aim to investigate the properties of the thick disk ,",
    "the sample stars are selected to have @xmath28 kpc since the edge of the thick disk is at about 5.5 kpc above the galactic plane as suggested by @xcite . with this limit ,",
    "we extract a sample of 2,729 rhb candidate stars from sdss dr8 .",
    "the left panel of fig .  1 shows the distributions of distance to the sun , vertical distance to the galactic plane and galactic latitude of the sample .",
    "in particular , the @xmath12 distribution of rhb stars has a peak around @xmath29 kpc and most of them are located within @xmath30 with a weak tail extending to @xmath31 .",
    "there is a hint of a minimum in the @xmath12 distribution at @xmath32 , which is taken as the selection limit of the thick disk in many works .",
    "after that , @xmath12 flattens out from @xmath32 kpc to @xmath33 kpc where we cut our sample . as we know that many previous works select thick disk stars with @xmath0 kpc or @xmath34 kpc , in the present work , we limit our sample to @xmath0 kpc and 1728 rhb stars",
    "are selected for studying the metallicity gradient .",

    ", we found the main contribution of our sample stars comes from k ( and partly red k ) giants , which covers the metallicity range of @xmath2}}\\sim -2.0 $ ] to the solar value ( with @xmath38 ) , has @xmath26 magnitudes brighter than 18.5 @xmath39 , @xmath40 and a color range of @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "these criteria will not produce a significant distance or metallicity bias in our sample selection , and thus we assume that these target selections in sdss / segue will not affect our result .",
    "the metallicity distribution of our sample stars is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 . it shows that the contribution from the thin disk is significant with 550 stars having @xmath2}}>-0.25 $ ] and a peak at @xmath2}}=-0.12 $ ] .",
    "the peak at @xmath43 kpc in fig .",
    "1 partly corresponds to this population .",
    "the halo has a negligible contribution with only 77 stars having @xmath2}}<-1.0 $ ] .",
    "there are 1101 stars with @xmath44}}<-0.25 $ ] , corresponding to the thick disk , which have peaks at @xmath1 kpc and @xmath2}}=-0.54 $ ] .    in order to exclude the contribution of the thin disk and the halo , we obtain simulation data from the besanon galaxy model @xcite using the selection criteria : ( i ) @xmath45 ; ( ii ) @xmath46 to @xmath47 with a step size of @xmath48 ; ( iii ) @xmath49 to @xmath50 with a step size of @xmath51 ; ( iv ) absolute magnitude @xmath52 and spectral type from f to k ; ( v ) population being either thin disk or halo ; and ( vi ) the color - metallicity relation and stellar parameter ranges for selecting rhb stars in @xcite .",
    "all these criteria fit our observed rhb star sample .",
    "then , the metallicity distributions of the simulated data for the thin disk and halo are normalized to the star numbers in the observed rhb sample for each population respectively .",
    "coincidently , the simulated thin disk from the model has the same metallicity peak at @xmath2}}= -0.115 $ ] and the simulated halo has negligible contribution to the metallicity distribution as shown by the dashed lines in the upper panel of fig",
    "the mdf of the thick disk after subtracting the simulated thin disk and halo contributions is shown in the lower panel of fig .  2 .",

    "thus , it provides a way to investigate the metallicity gradient for @xmath58 kpc .",
    "we perform the same procedure to each of the five different @xmath12 bins as that in sect.3.1 and obtain the gaussian peak of the metallicity histogram for each @xmath12 bin .",
    "3 shows the metallicity distribution for the @xmath59 kpc bin before and after subtracting contributions from the thin disk and halo components based on model data .",
    "the resulting peak metallicities from the gaussian fits to the metallicity histograms for five different @xmath12 bins are shown in table 1 , as well as the height range , the median @xmath12 and the star counts .",
    "the bin size for the plotted histograms are 0.05 dex and we have checked that a bin size of either 0.02 or 0.10 will not significantly change the gaussian peak in the fit , but the distribution will deviate from a gaussian function for one or two bins .",
    "the errors in the metallicity peak in table 1 are estimated by the gaussian dispersion of the metallicity peaks from 1000 simulated samples randomly selected from the observed samples for each height bin using a bootstrap method .",
    "4 shows the peak metallicity of the thick disk mdf as a function of median @xmath12 and the metallicity gradient is estimated from the weighted least squares fit to the data .",
    "the metallicity gradient is @xmath60 dex kpc@xmath4 with an intercept of @xmath61 dex .",
    "this gradient is slightly steeper than that of @xcite who found @xmath15 dex kpc@xmath4 with an intercept of @xmath62 dex .    in order to estimate the errors from the besanon galaxy model , we vary the normalization factors in both the halo and the thin disk components by reducing and enhancing the adopted value by 10% , which is a worst case scenario , and the modeled metallicity distributions deviate clearly from the observed distributions .",
    "we therefore obtain an additional four sets of gaussian metallicity peaks of the thick disk for each bin . in total , we have five sets of metallicity distributions for five @xmath12 bins , which produces 3125 metallicity gradients in the lower panel of fig .  4 .",
    "all these slopes lie within @xmath63 to @xmath64 , and thus the errors from uncertainties in the besanon model do not have a significant effect on the metallicity gradients .",

    "this may be the case for g2 to g5 .",
    "note that g2 to g5 have different x variations : g3 has nearly a fixed x value and g2 has little x variation , while g4 and g5 have significant x variation .",

    "this does not mean that there is no radial ( hereafter x is referred to as radial ) metallicity gradient .",
    "instead , the decreasing intercept ( @xmath65 in table 2 ) from g2 to g5 indicates a negative radial gradient and a linear fit to the @xmath65 versus median x for g2 to g5 gives a slope of @xmath66 dex kpc@xmath4 .",
    "such a small slope has no significant effect on the @xmath2}}$ ] versus @xmath12 fits for our g2 to g5 where x variations are less than 5 kpc .",
    "the small effect of x variation on the vertical metallicity gradient for g2 to g5 can be further confirmed by similar metallicity distributions among these groups with different median x values for similar @xmath12 ranges of @xmath67 kpc . for this purpose",
    ", we investigate the cumulative distribution function ( hereafter cdf ) for @xmath2}}$ ] via the ks test among the five groups .",
    "for the two groups in the anti - galactocenter direction g4 and g5 , similar @xmath2}}$ ] cdfs with a @xmath68value of 0.14 are shown in fig .",
    "this agrees with @xcite where the two directions toward m3 and m5 in the anti - galactocenter region show similar @xmath2}}$ ] distributions . since g4 is located inside of g5 , similar @xmath2}}$ ] cdfs indicate the variation of metallicity with x is not detectable .",
    "similarly , g2 and g3 have similar @xmath12 distributions with little or no x variation within the group , and a ks test yields a @xmath68value of 0.33 for the @xmath2}}$ ] cdfs based on stars with @xmath69 kpc .",
    "again , g2 is located inside of g3 and similar cdfs indicate x differences between g2 and g3 do not have a significant effect on their metallicity distributions .",
    "similar @xmath2}}$ ] cdfs are found for g3 and g4 , but this is not the case for the comparison between g1 and g5 .",
    "9 shows the similar @xmath12 but different @xmath2}}$ ] cdfs between g1 and g5 , being the two extreme cases in opposite @xmath70 directions . for @xmath71 } } < -0.4 $ ] , g1 and g5 have exactly the same cdfs while at both ends the differences in the @xmath2}}$ ] cdfs are significant .",
    "two possible reasons may explain the special case of g1 .",
    "it has been suggested that the effect of @xmath2}}$ ] variation with x can not be neglected for a scale length of the thick disk between 2 and 4 kpc .",
    "alternatively , it is expected that g1 has a high contribution of stars at both the metal poor end and the metal rich end from the bulge population with a wide metallicity range of @xmath72 } } < 0.5 $ ] , which will steepen the gradient .",
    "in addition , it seems that g1 also has a special kinematic distribution in fig .",

    "we have estimated the metallicity gradient for the thick disk population in two ways using rhb stars selected from sdss dr8 data .",
    "the first method is based on the gaussian peak of the metallicity distribution in five @xmath12 bins by subtracting the contribution from the thin disk and halo via the besanon galaxy model .",
    "the slope is @xmath60 dex kpc@xmath4 with an intercept of @xmath61 dex .",
    "the second method is linearly fitting the data in the @xmath2}}- |z|$ ] diagrams directly for stars from @xmath69 kpc , where the contribution from the thin disk and halo is not significant .",
    "five groups in different directions can be separated to test for consistency , and we found that they give similar gradients of around @xmath73 dex kpc@xmath4 in four groups , with the only exception for the direction with @xmath74 .",
    "both methods indicate the existence of a metallicity gradient in the thick disk . in our opinion",
    ", the first method gives a lower gradient because the model predictions suppress the existence of both metal rich and metal poor components in the thick disk .",
