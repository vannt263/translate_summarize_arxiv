    "computational spectral theory for operators which act on infinite dimensional hilbert spaces has advanced significantly in recent years . for self - adjoint operators",
    ", the introduction of _ quadratic _ methods has enabled the approximation of those eigenvalues which are not reliably located by a direct application of the galerkin method .",
    "the latter is due to _ spectral pollution _ ; see examples [ uber2 ] , [ magneto ] and @xcite .",
    "notable amongst these quadratic techniques are the davies & plum method @xcite , the zimmermann & mertins method @xcite , and the second order relative spectra @xcite . for spectral approximation of arbitrary operators",
    "see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the present manuscript is concerned with a technique for self - adjoint operators which is pollution - free and non - quadratic .",
    "the idea is to perturb eigenvalues into @xmath5 and then approximate them with the galerkin method .",
    "this idea was initially proposed for a particular class of differential operators ; see @xcite .",
    "an abstract version of this approach for bounded self - adjoint operators was formulated in @xcite .",
    "the latter requires  priori information about the location of gaps in the essential spectrum .",
    "our main aims are to remove the requirement of  priori information , to present a rigorous convergence analysis , and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method including a comparison with the quadratic methods . along the way",
    ", we also prove new spectral enclosure results for any operator of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is self - adjoint and @xmath2 is bounded and self - adjoint ; we note that any bounded operator can be expressed in this form .",
    "we now give a brief outline of our main results .    in section 3",
    ", we consider the spectra of operators of the form @xmath0 .",
    "the main result is theorem [ cor1a ] where we give our new spectral enclosure results .",
    "we will define a region in terms of the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then show that it contains the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "corollary [ 2eigs ] shows that the enclosure is , in a sense , sharp .",
    "section 4 is primarily concerned with the perturbation of an eigenvalue , @xmath6 , of a self - adjoint operator , @xmath1 .",
    "we consider @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a sequence of orthogonal projections .",
    "the main results are theorem [ est ] and theorem [ qq ] where we prove extremely rapid convergence properties of the eigenspaces and eigenvalues associated to the perturbed eigenvalue .    in section 5 , we present our new perturbation method .",
    "the idea is based on applying the galerkin method to @xmath9 for a fixed @xmath10 .",
    "the preceding results enable us to lift an eigenvalue , @xmath6 , off the real line , away from the essential spectrum , and extremely close to @xmath11 where it can be approximated by a direct application of the galerkin method .",
    "the main results are theorem [ limlem1 ] and theorem [ eigconv ] , where we prove the rapid convergence of galerkin eigenspaces and eigenvalues .    in section 6 , we apply our method to several operators arising in magnetohydrodynamics , non - relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "most of our examples involve calculations using trial spaces belonging to the form domain and not the operator domain .",
    "in particular , we use the fem spaces of piecewise linear trial functions . however , the quadratic methods require trial spaces from the operator domain .",
    "in our last example we use the operator domain which allows a comparison with the quadratic methods .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of how to compute eigenvalues of a self - adjoint operator when a direct application of the galerkin ( finite - section ) method is unreliable . </S>",
    "<S> the last two decades have seen the development of the so - called quadratic methods for addressing this problem . </S>",
    "<S> recently a new perturbation approach has emerged , the idea being to perturb eigenvalues off the real line and , consequently , away from regions where the galerkin method fails . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simplified perturbation method which requires no  priori information and for which we provide a rigorous convergence analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the latter shows that , in general , our approach will significantly outperform the quadratic methods . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a new spectral enclosure for operators of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is self - adjoint , @xmath2 is self - adjoint and bounded . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to control , very precisely , how eigenvalues are perturbed from the real line . </S>",
    "<S> the main results are demonstrated with examples including magnetohydrodynamics , schrdinger and dirac operators .    _ </S>",
