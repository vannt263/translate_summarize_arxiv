    "l@xmath0  puppis ( hr 2748 ; hip 34922 ) is a bright nearby red giant with a pulsation period of about 140d . its spectral type of m5eiii and luminosity of 1500 l@xmath2 indicate that it is evolving towards the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "evidence for mass loss at a rate of @xmath3 @xcite supports this .",
    "l@xmath0  pup is possibly the nearest star in this evolutionary phase , at a hipparcos distance of @xmath4pc . among known long - period agb stars ,",
    "only r  doradus has a similar distance . at 12 microns ,",
    "l@xmath0  pup is among the 15 brightest sources in the iras point source catalogue .",
    "l@xmath0  pup is unusual in several respects .",
    "firstly , it shows a high degree of optical polarization , with a variable wavelength dependence that implies a long timescale for the growth and dissipation of dust grains ( of the order of a decade ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , co measurements by @xcite indicate a very low expansion velocity ( about 2.5kms@xmath5 ) , which led them to label l@xmath0  pup as an extreme case , with one of the smallest expansion velocities ever measured for an agb star . the slow wind from l@xmath0  pup led @xcite to suggest that this star could represent their b - model , in which mass loss is driven entirely by pulsations , without any significant input from radiation pressure on dust grains",
    "this has been further discussed by @xcite , who modelled the mass loss and suggested that the pulsations may be non - radial .",
    "thirdly , as we report here , this star has shown a remarkable change in mean visual magnitude over the past century , and is currently undergoing a dramatic dimming .",
    "we present visual and infrared photometry which characterizes this behaviour , and argue that the most likely cause is the formation of dust along the line of sight .",
    "we also present the first 10-micron spectrum of l@xmath0  pup , obtained with the japanese irts satellite , which shows strong silicate emission .",
    "we have analysed visual observations of l@xmath0  pup from the following sources : the royal astronomical society of new zealand ( rasnz ; 12100 measurements by 110 observers , including 1100 by a.  jones ) , the variable star observers league in japan ( vsolj ; 792 measurements by 6 observers ) and the association francaise des observateurs detoiles variables ( afoev ; 389 measurements by 3 observers ) .",
    "only data from individual observers contributing 30 or more observations were used and we did not attempt to correct for offsets between observers .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.wavelet ] shows the combined data , binned to 10-day averages .",
    "the variation in mean magnitude is evident . before 1945",
    "the data are too patchy and/or noisy to reach strong conclusions .",
    "however , it is clear that the star faded significantly after 1960 , recovering around 1975 but remaining fainter by about 0.5 mag compared to the 1950s .",
    "recently , starting around 1994 , a dramatic fading has occurred . even at maximum ,",
    "the star now remains fainter than magnitude  6 , and it is no longer a naked - eye variable .    we have used wavelet analysis to search for period and amplitude changes .",
    "wavelets have been used previously to study long - period variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we used the weighted wavelet z - transform ( wwz ; @xcite ) , developed specifically for unevenly sampled data .",
    "we experimented with different values for the parameter @xmath6 , which defines the tradeoff between time resolution and frequency resolution @xcite , and settled on @xmath7 as a good compromise .",
    "more details of the application of the wwz transform to long - period variables are given by @xcite .",
    "the lower three panels of figure  [ fig.wavelet ] show the wavelet plots for l@xmath0  pup , based on the light curve in the top panel .",
    "the second panel shows the wwz transform , with the grey scale indicating the significance of each frequency as a function of time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "only a small range of frequencies is shown  there is no evidence for significant power outside this range .",
    "the third and fourth panels show , for each time bin , the semi - amplitude ( in magnitudes ) and period ( in days ) corresponding to the peak of the wwz in the second panel .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig.wavelet ] that the period of l@xmath0  pup has remained within a fairly narrow range ( 135145d ) for the past 75 years .",
    "such period jitter is common among semiregular and mira variables .",
    "there is a slight indication of a lengthening of period _ before _ the onset of the recent dimming , from 136 to 142 days , but the change ( at most 4% ) is well within the range of normal mira variables . the amplitude , on the other hand , has changed significantly over the years , but the changes are apparently uncorrelated with the period jitter .",
    "l@xmath0  pup is classified as an srb variable , a class of stars with poorly defined periodicity .",
    "in fact , the period of this star is remarkably stable .",
    "the characteristics of the wavelet plot show that l@xmath0  pup should be classified as sra , a class closely related to miras , often differing only in having smaller amplitudes .",
    "l@xmath0  pup was discovered to be variable by gould in 1872 @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated a period of 137.2d from the dates of nine maxima observed by himself , gould and williams during 187292 .",
    "@xcite , in the _ second catalogue of variable stars _ , quoted a period of 140.15d , which they attributed to roberts .",
    "@xcite listed dates of maxima going back to 1872 , and also adopted a period of 140.15d .",
    "it therefore seems that the period of l@xmath0  pup has remained within a narrow range since its discovery .",
    "the visual magnitude at maximum during the late 1800s was about 3.6 @xcite , consistent with modern ( 1950s ) out - of - decline values .",
    "@xcite listed the magnitude range since discovery as 3.44.6 at maximum and 5.86.2 at minimum .",
    "this suggests that , between 1872 and 1918 , l@xmath0  pup was never as faint as it currently is .",
    "we have taken @xmath8 infrared photometry from @xcite , together with more recent observations obtained with the same system ( see table  [ table.ir ] ) .",
    "the infrared observations are much less frequent than the visual ones and do not sample the pulsation cycle very well . nevertheless , the mean infrared magnitudes can be estimated , and we have shown these in fig .  [ fig.ir ] by fitting a low - order polynomial to each waveband .",
    ".[table.ir ] near - infrared photometry of l@xmath0  pup [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -10pt @xmath9 range between smallest grains at inner radius and largest grains at outer radius + @xmath10 assuming [ fe / h]@xmath11    the most constraining aspects of the spectrum are the lack of dust emission at 8@xmath1 m and the strong silicate feature , which preclude the presence of hot dust . in our ` best ' model , the inner radius is at a dust temperature of 350k , well below the dust condensation temperature .",
    "the 17@xmath1 m flux ( also dominated by silicate emission ) is also surprisingly sensitive to the inner radius and agrees with a dust shell detached from its condensation point .",
    "the outer radius is not as well determined as the inner radius .",
    "however , a single thin shell can fit the long - wavelength iras / dirbe flux densities .",
    "there is no evidence for a cold distant dust shell , consistent with the low co mass - loss rate found by @xcite .    between 4 and 8@xmath1 m ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution indicates a colour temperature consistent with the photospheric temperature .",
    "@xcite argued that dust emission dominates from 5@xmath1 m , based on evidence that the variability behaviour is very different longward of 5@xmath1 m .",
    "however , the emission in this band in mira variables is dominated by water vapour at @xmath122000k , located in the extended envelope at about 1.5 stellar radii @xcite .",
    "this water vapour also raises the flux in this region above that extrapolated from the photospheric @xmath13 magnitudes , as seen in the fit .",
    "our findings do not indicate a substantial contribution from dust to the spectrum shortward of 8@xmath1 m .",
    "we derive a ( pre - dimming ) mass - loss rate of @xmath14 .",
    "this is similar to that estimated by @xcite ( post - dimming ) .",
    "they found a dust mass - loss rate 4 times larger than derived by us because they adopted a dust outflow velocity of 10kms@xmath5 rather than 2.5kms@xmath5 , but used a much lower gas - to - dust ratio , which almost cancels this difference .",
    "our high gas - to - dust ratio is based on the assumption that l@xmath0 pup is a thick - disk star ( see sec .  [ sec.thickdisk ] ) , for which we have assumed [ fe / h]@xmath11 . in reality",
    "the gas mass - loss rate is not well determined .",
    "the model shows that the photometric data imply a narrower silicate feature than is observed .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the observed 10-@xmath1 m feature is not purely silicate . in the scheme of @xcite , this feature in l@xmath0  pup",
    "would be classified either as ` broad ' or possibly as ` silicate d ' .",
    "( the difference is subtle and requires continuum subtraction , for which we lack sufficient wavelength coverage . )",
    "they fitted the broad feature with a mixture of olivine ( mgfesio@xmath15 ) and porous amorphous alumina ( or corundum ) ( al@xmath0o@xmath16 ) .",
    "corundum has the highest condensation temperature of any circumstellar solid , and is the first condensate to form at @xmath17k .",
    "silicates may form subsequently from gas - solid reactions with alumina @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the broad feature is seen in less evolved mira variables .",
    "this may reflect the possiblity that , at low @xmath18 , the conversion of alumina to silicate ( replacing the al with mg ) remains incomplete , due to a low reaction rate .",
    "we note that our model calculations used the pre - dimming spectrum .",
    "it would interesting to see whether the spectrum has changed significantly since the dimming .",
    "if alumina formed first , the peak of the 10@xmath1 m feature may have shifted to the red .",
    "it is tempting to associate the alumina with the grey extinction curve , but it has little extinction in the optical ( glass - like ) .",
    "better candidates would be tio@xmath0 or pyroxenes @xcite .",
    "the precise agent responsible for the variable polarization also remains undetermined .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the luminosity and effective temperature of l@xmath0  pup do not unambiguously identify it as an agb star , and allow the possibility that it is on the first ascent red giant branch .",
    "it is not clear whether the spectrum of l@xmath0  pup shows technetium , which is usually taken as indicating an agb star .",
    "@xcite reported a probable detection , while @xcite listed only a possible detection .",
    "however , if the @xmath19-band has significant obscuration then the bolometric magnitude has been underestimated .",
    "the bolometric correction would also have been overestimated because of the observed @xmath20 is too large .",
    "the two effects combined would mean that the actual luminosity is substantially greater than has been assumed , and is perhaps sufficiently large that placement on the agb is unambiguous .    finally , as pointed out by @xcite , the space motion of l@xmath0  pup indicates it may be a thick disk star .",
    "given that the thick disk accounts for up to 13%  of the local star density @xcite , it is not unexpected to find a local mira - like example .",
    "if l@xmath0  pup is indeed a thick - disk star , as seems plausible but which can not be stated with certainty , the progenitor would likely have had a low metallicity and a low mass .",
    "visual photometry of l@xmath0  pup shows an unprecedented dimming over the past 5 years .",
    "the long - term light curve shows stable periodicity , and we argue that l@xmath0  pup is mira - like and should be classified as sra .",
    "the period stability implies a constant stellar radius , which rules out temperature and/or luminosity variations as the cause of the dimming .",
    "rather , the dimming seems to arise from an episode of dust formation close to the extended atmosphere .",
    "episodic dust obscuration events are fairly common in carbon stars but have not been seen in ( non - symbiotic ) oxygen - rich stars .",
    "we suggest that dust forms continuously but anisotropically , with the current dimming event being due to to dust formation along the line of sight .    the red colours indicate reddening from dust , but the extinction curve is greyer than found for ism dust .",
    "this could reflect a higher fraction of oxides .",
    "the change of colour during the dimming indicates that already before the dimming , the @xmath21-band magnitude was significantly affected by circumstellar or atmospheric extinction .",
    "l@xmath0  pup was one of the few stars located below the mira @xmath22@xmath23 relation : the derived @xmath19-band extinction puts the star in closer agreement with this relation .",
    "we present a 10-@xmath1 m spectrum showing strong silicate emission .",
    "these observations were carried out in 1995 , just prior to the recent dimming .",
    "the silicate feature can be fitted with a detached , thin dust shell , with inner radius @xmath24 and outer radius @xmath25 .",
    "longer wavelength photometry shows no evidence for more distant , colder dust .",
    "we derive a mass - loss rate of @xmath26 , but this value depends on the assumed expansion velocity and metallicity  if the dust velocity is high , the actual mass - loss rate could be higher .",
    "we are extremely grateful to the observers who have provided visual observations , and to those who have maintained the databases and made them publicly available .",
    "we also thank peter tuthill for useful discussions .",
