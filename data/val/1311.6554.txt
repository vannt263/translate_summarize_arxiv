    "the interest in applied graph theory has exploded during the last decade @xcite .",
    "the field is interdisciplinary and has relations with other subjects like computer , biological and social sciences and has been made accessible to a larger audience in books like @xcite .",
    "+ we look here at generalizations of cayley graphs which can be used to model networks having statistical features similar to known random networks but which have an appearance of real networks .",
    "we have mentioned some connections with elementary number theory already in @xcite .",
    "the graphs are constructed using * transformation monoids * analogously as * cayley graphs * are defined by a group acting on a group .",
    "the deterministic construction produces graphs which resemble empirical networks seen in synapses , chemical or biological networks , the web or social networks , and especially in peer to peer networks . +",
    "a motivation for our construction is the iteration of quadratic maps in the complex plane which features an amazing variety of complexity and mathematical content .",
    "if the field of complex numbers @xmath16 is replaced by a finite ring @xmath1 like @xmath7 , we deal with arithmetic dynamical systems in a number theoretical setup .",
    "this is natural because a computer simulates differential equations on a finite set .",
    "it is still not understood well , why and how finite approximations of continuum systems share so many features with the continuum .",
    "examples of such investigations are @xcite . the fact that polynomial maps produce arithmetic chaos",
    "is exploited by pseudo random number generators like the pollard rho method for integer factorization @xcite . +",
    "a second motivation is the construction of deterministic realistic networks .",
    "important quantities for networks are the characteristic path length @xmath8 and the mean cluster coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "both are averages : the first one is the average of @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the average over all distances @xmath18 with @xmath19 , the second is the average of the fraction of the number of edges in the sphere graph @xmath20 of a vertex @xmath21 divided by the number of edges of the complete graph with vertices in @xmath20 .",
    "nothing changes when replace @xmath8 with the * median path length * and @xmath9 with the * global cluster coefficient * which is the frequency of oriented triangles @xmath22 within all oriented connected vertex triples . + a third point of view is more algebraic . as we learned from @xcite",
    ", orbital networks relate to * automata * , edge colored directed graphs with possible self loops and multiple loops .",
    "an automaton can encode the monoid acting on the finite set .",
    "but the graph of the monoid @xmath0 is obtained by connecting two vertices @xmath23 if there is no element @xmath0 with @xmath24 .",
    "this graph is the null graph if @xmath25 is synchronizing ( there is @xmath26 which has has a single point as an image ) and the complete group if @xmath25 is a permutation subgroup of the full permutation group @xcite .",
    "an example of a problem in that field is the task to compute the probability that two random endofunctions generate a synchronizing monoid .",
    "this indicates that also the mathematics of graphs generated by finitely many transformations can be tricky .",
    "we became also aware of @xcite , who developed a theory of finite transformation monoids .",
    "in that terminology , the graph generated by @xmath0 is called an * orbital digraph*. this prompted us to address the finite simple graphs under consideration as * orbital networks*. + that the subject has some number theoretical flavour has been indicated already @xcite .",
    "it shows that elementary number theory matters when trying to understand connectivity properties of the graphs .",
    "we would not be surprised to see many other connections .",
    "+ modeling graphs algebraically could have practical values . recall that in computer vision , various algorithms are known to represent objects .",
    "the highest entropy version is to give a triangularization of a solid or to give a bitmap of a picture .",
    "low entropy realizations on the other hand store the object using mathematical equations like inequalities or polynomials in several variables .",
    "it is an ai task to generate low entropy descriptions .",
    "this can mean to produce vector graphics representations of a given bitmap , or to use bzier curves and nurb surfaces to build objects .",
    "fractal encoding algorithms have been used to encode and compress pictures : iterated function systems encode similar parts of the picture @xcite .",
    "similarly , an application of orbital networks could be to realize parts of networks with low entropy descriptions in such a way that relevant statistical properties agree with the actual network .",
    "+ in the context of computer science , monoids are important to describe languages as * synthactic monoids*. an analogue of cayley s theorem tells that every group is a subgroup of a transformation group , every finite monoid can be realized as a transformation monoid on a finite set @xmath27 . when seen from an information theoretical point of view",
    ", an orbital network describes a language , where the vertices are the alphabet and the transformations describe the rules .",
    "every finite path in the graph now describes a possible word in the language .",
    "+ finally , there is a geometric point of view , which actually is our main interest .",
    "graphs share remarkably many parallels with riemannian manifolds .",
    "key results on riemannian manifolds or more general metric spaces with cohomology have direct analogues for finite simple graphs . while functionals like the hilbert action on riemannian manifolds are difficult to study , finite simple graphs provide a laboratory to do geometry , where one can experiment with a modest amount of effort .",
    "we will look elsewhere at the relation of various functionals on graphs , like the euler characteristic , characteristic path length , hilbert action .",
    "it turns out that some of the notions known to graph theory only can be pushed to riemannian manifolds .",
    "functionals studied in graph theory can thus be studied also in riemannian geometry .",
    "+    * acknowledgement*. the graph construction described here emerged during a few meetings in september and october 2013 with montasser ghachem who deserves equal credit for its discovery @xcite , but who decided not to be a coauthor of this paper .",
    "given a fixed ring @xmath1 like @xmath5 and a finite set @xmath0 of maps @xmath28 , a digraph is obtained by taking the set of vertices @xmath3 and edges @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are in @xmath0 . by ignoring self loops , multiple connections as well as directions ,",
    "we obtain a finite simple graph , which we call the * dynamical graph * or * orbital network * generated by the system @xmath31 .",
    "the name has been used before and distinguishes from other classes of dynamically generate graphs : either by random aggregation or by applying deterministic or random transformation rules to a given graph .",
    "+    orbital networks have been used since a long time .",
    "if a group given by a finite set of generators @xmath0 acts on itself , the visualization is called the * cayley graph * of the group .",
    "it is a directed graph but leaving away the direction produces a finite simple graph which is often used as a visualization for the group .",
    "these graphs are by definition vertex transitive and especially , the vertex degree is constant . for one - dimensional dynamical systems given by maps defined on finite sets , the graph visualization has been used at least since collatz in 1928 @xcite .",
    "it appears also in demonstrations @xcite or work @xcite on cellular automata .",
    "the graphs are sometimes called * automata networks * @xcite .",
    "the iteration digraph of the quadratic map has been studied in @xcite : as has been noted first by szalay in 1992 , as has been a symmetry if @xmath32 modulo @xmath33 or @xmath34 modulo @xmath33 .",
    "szalay also noted that the number of fixed points of @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of distinct primes dividing @xmath38 .",
    "the miniature theorem on fermat primes rediscovered in @xcite has already been known to szalay in 1992 and rogers in 1996 .",
    "somer and krizek show that there exists a closed loop of length @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40 for some odd positive divisor @xmath41 of the carmichael lambda function @xmath42 and where @xmath43 is the multiplicative order of @xmath44 modulo @xmath38 .",
    "+ when looking at classes of maps , we get a probability space of graphs .",
    "for example , if we consider two quadratic maps @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "we get a probability space @xmath47 of parameters @xmath48 . with @xmath49 quadratic maps , the probability space @xmath50 presents itself . + an other example is to take the ring @xmath51 and to consider the hnon type maps @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are parameters , where again with @xmath49 maps the probability space is @xmath50 . if @xmath54 , the maps are invertible and generate a subgroup of the permutation group . an interesting class of graphs obtained with @xmath55 $ ] on @xmath7 , where @xmath56 $ ] is the floor function will be studied separately .",
    "we focus first on maps which are defined in an arithmetic way .",
    "an other example is by replacing polynomials with exponential maps like with @xmath57 on @xmath7 or linear matrix maps like @xmath58 on @xmath59 or higher degree polynomial maps like @xmath60 .",
    "an example of algebro - geometric type is to look at the ring @xmath61/i$ ] , where @xmath62 $ ] is the polynomial ring over a finite field @xmath63 and @xmath64 an ideal , then consider the two maps @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are fixed polynomials .",
    "+    every finite simple graph is an orbital network with @xmath41 generators , where @xmath41 is the maximal degree of the graph .",
    "if the graph has @xmath38 vertices , take @xmath5 .",
    "now label the elements in each sphere @xmath20 with @xmath67 .",
    "now define @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we often can use less generators .",
    "of course our interest is not for general graphs , but rather for cases , where @xmath30 are given by simple arithmetic formulas , where we have a natural probability space of graphs .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is generated by @xmath41 polynomials @xmath30 on @xmath7 , then @xmath72 equipped with a counting measure is a natural probability space . +",
    "an other natural example is if @xmath30 are random permutations on @xmath7 .",
    "this is a random model but the statistics often mirrors what we see in the case of arithmetic transformations , only that in the arithmetic case , the @xmath38 dependence can fluctuate , as it depends on the factorization of @xmath38 .",
    "+    if the monoid generated by @xmath0 can be extended to a group , then a connected orbital network is a factor of a cayley graph .",
    "if the monoid generated by @xmath0 is a group @xmath73 , then all @xmath30 are permutations .",
    "take a vertex @xmath74 . since the graph is connected , @xmath75 is the entire vertex set .",
    "the graph homomorphism @xmath76 shows that the graph @xmath77 is a factor of the cayley graph of @xmath77 generated by @xmath0 .    remark .",
    "embedding the monoid in a group using a grothendieck type construction is not always possible .",
    "various graph quantities can be measured when studying graphs . even so we have a deterministic construction",
    ", we can look at graph quantities as * random variables * over a probability space of a class of generators @xmath0 . examples",
    "are the global degree average @xmath78 , the euler characteristic @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the number of @xmath81 subgraphs of @xmath77 , the inductive dimension @xmath82 @xcite , the number of cliques @xmath83 of dimension @xmath49 in @xmath77 , the average degree @xmath84 , the betti numbers @xmath85 , the diameter @xmath86 , the characteristic path length @xmath87 , the global clustering coefficient @xmath16 which is the average occupancy density in spheres @xcite or the variance of the degree distribution or curvature @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of subgraphs @xmath81 in the unit sphere @xmath20 of a vertex . +    an interesting quantity to study in our context",
    "is the * length - clustering coefficient * @xmath90    \\ ; ,   \\label{lengthcluster}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the average characteristic length and @xmath9 the mean cluster coefficient .",
    "we are not aware that it has been studied already .",
    "+ the largest accumulation point limsup and the minimal accumulation point liminf can be called the * upper and lower length - cluster coefficient*. for most dynamical graphs , we see that the liminf and limsup exists for @xmath11 and that the limit exists along primes .",
    "it exists also for erdoes - renyi graphs , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 have limits themselves also for fixed degree random graphs , where we see @xmath91 to converge .",
    "the limit is infinite for watts - strogatz networks in the limit @xmath11 due to large clustering and zero for barabasi - albert networks in the limit @xmath11 . for graphs defined by random permutations ,",
    "we see @xmath91 converges to @xmath14 . +",
    "it has become custom in the literature to use a logarithmic scale in @xmath38 so that one gets linear dependence of @xmath8 and @xmath92 . despite the fact that both clustering coefficient and characteristic length are widely used",
    ", the relation between these two seems not have been considered already . while the clustering coefficient at a vertex is a local property which often can be accessed , the characteristic length is harder to study theoretically . for random graphs we measure clear convergence of @xmath91 in the limit : + in the first case , the probability space is the set of all pairs of permutations on @xmath7 .",
    "it is a set with @xmath93 elements . here",
    "are some questions .",
    "+    in the next case , we take for @xmath94 the probability space @xmath95 of all pairs @xmath96 leading to pairs of transformations @xmath97 , @xmath98 . also for the following question",
    "there is strong evidence : +    this remarkable relation between the global clustering coefficient @xmath9 which is the average of a local property and the characteristic length @xmath8 , which involves the average length of geodesics in the graph and is not an average of local properties .",
    "intuitively , such a relation is to be expected because a larger @xmath9 will allow for shorter paths .",
    "if the limit exists then @xmath99 which would be useful to know because the characteristic length is difficult to compute while the clustering coefficient @xmath9 is easier to determine . to allow an analogy from differential geometry , we can compare the local clustering coefficient @xmath100 with curvature , because a metric space large curvature has a small average distance between two points .",
    "+ relations between local properties of vertices and global characteristic length are not new . in @xcite ,",
    "a heuristic estimate @xmath101 is derived , where @xmath41 is the average degree and @xmath102 the average @xmath103-nearest neighbors .",
    "note that @xmath104 so that @xmath105 can be interpreted as the logarithm of the average edge density on @xmath38 vertices and that @xmath106 can be seen as a * scalar curvature*. unlike the newman strogatz watts formula , which uses global edge density we take the average of the edge density in spheres . to take an analogy of differential geometry again ,",
    "we could look at graphs with a given edge density and minimize the average path length between two points .",
    "this can be seen as a path integral .",
    "we will look at the relation of various functionals elsewhere .",
    "+ we have studied in @xcite graphs generated by finitely many maps @xmath107 \\ ; { \\rm mod } \\ ; n$ ] , where @xmath108 are positive integers and where @xmath109 is a real parameter .",
    "we see that for @xmath109 larger than @xmath14 and not too close to @xmath14and @xmath109 not an integer , the graphs are essentially random , while for @xmath110 or @xmath109 close to @xmath14 , there are geometric patterns .",
    "we are obviously interested in the @xmath109 dependence .",
    "the reason for the interest is that for @xmath111 we get watts - strogatz initial conditions for @xmath112 . in @xcite",
    ", we especially took maps of the form @xmath113 \\ ; { \\rm mod } \\ ; n , i \\geq 2 $ ] on @xmath7 , where @xmath56 $ ] denotes the floor function giving the largest integer smaller or equal to @xmath21 . these are deterministic graphs which produce statistical properties as the watts - strogatz models .",
    "we have looked already at special connectivity questions in @xcite .",
    "one challenge for affine maps is to find necessary and sufficient conditions that the map @xmath114 leads to a connected graph on @xmath7 .",
    "an other * network mandelbrot challenge * is to that the graph on @xmath7 generated by @xmath115 is connected for all @xmath38 .",
    "we look at other examples here , which are more of probabilistic nature .",
    "+ given a probability space of graphs , we can look at the probability that a graph is connected . here",
    "are three challenges for quadratic maps along prime @xmath38 : we see in one dimensions that connectivity gets rarer , in two dimensions that it becomes more frequent and in three or higher dimensions that connectivity is the rule . + in the following , we look at maps @xmath97 generated on @xmath7 , where @xmath38 is prime .",
    "we denote by @xmath116 the probability that the graph is connected , where the probability space is is the set of @xmath41 different maps @xmath97 . denote by @xmath117 the @xmath49th prime .    for random permutation graphs , we have @xmath118 because there are @xmath119 cycles in a group of @xmath120 transformations .",
    "dixon s theorem tells that the probability that two random transformations generate a transitive subgroup is @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "+    we have checked c ) until prime @xmath122 .",
    "if the maps under consideration preserve some symmetry , then also the graphs can share this symmetry .",
    "we illustrate this with a simple example :    assume @xmath38 is even and @xmath123 on @xmath7 and @xmath53 are even , then the graph @xmath77 is the union of two disconnected graphs @xmath124 . if @xmath38 is not a multiple of @xmath33 , the two graphs @xmath125 are isomorphic . +    all maps leave the subsets of even and odd nodes invariant .",
    "this shows that the graph is the union @xmath126 of two graphs which have no connection . to see the isomorphism",

    "also this map gets from @xmath136 to @xmath137 and @xmath137 to @xmath136 .",
    "again , we check that @xmath138 now , if @xmath49 is even , we apply this to the even nodes , if @xmath49 is odd we apply this map to odd nodes . in goth cases , it is invertible .",
    "+ ( iii ) finally , if @xmath139 , then the isomorphism is again @xmath131 .",
    "again we see that @xmath140 is a multiple of @xmath38 for any map @xmath0 .    if @xmath123 on @xmath7 where @xmath38 is even and @xmath53 are odd , then the graph is bipartite and does not have any odd cycles .",
    "it in particular does not have any triangles , so that the global clustering coefficient is zero in that case .",
    "we can split the vertex set into an odd and even component @xmath141 .",
    "each of the maps @xmath30 forms a connection from @xmath142 to @xmath143",
    ".    * remarks . *",
    "+ * 1 ) * we see experimentally that if @xmath38 a multiple of @xmath33 , then for most cases , there is no isomorphism of the two component .",
    "we expect the probability of such events goes to zero for @xmath11 .",
    "statistically , it is unlikely that two random graphs are isomorphic , so that we just might have rare events .",
    "+ * 2 ) * if @xmath38 is even and not divisible by @xmath144 and all generators are polynomials which preserve odd or even numbers , then the graph @xmath77 is the disjoint union of two graphs . if all generators switch from odd to even numbers , then the graph is bipartite .",
    "if @xmath131 and @xmath145 and @xmath146 is a multiple of @xmath38 then @xmath147 is a conjugation . in any case , if all @xmath30 switch from even to odd , then the two parts of the bipartite graph are the even and odd numbers .",
    "here are some additional remarks : + * 1 ) * motivated by the mandelbrot set which is defined as the set the parameters @xmath148 for which the julia set @xmath149 is not connected , we can look at all the parameter @xmath66 for which the arithmetic graph generated by @xmath150 acting on @xmath5 is connected .",
    "this is encoded in the matrix @xmath151 which gives the number of components of the graph .",
    "it depends very much on number theoretical properties .    *",
    "2 ) * how many quadratic generators are necessary on @xmath7 to reach a certain edge density ? certainly , @xmath38 generators @xmath152 suffice to generate the complete graph @xmath153 .",
    "the edge density @xmath154 is half of the average degree @xmath41 . by adding more generators , we increase @xmath41 and @xmath16 and decrease @xmath87 .",
    "it is in general an interesting * modeling question * to find a set of polynomial maps which produce a graph similar to a given network .    * 3 ) * on @xmath5 with @xmath41 generators of the form @xmath155 , we call @xmath156 the smallest diameter of a graph which can be achieved",
