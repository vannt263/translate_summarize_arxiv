    "at the end of september 2011 , the opera collaboration announced the remarkable detection of superluminal muon neutrinos at the @xmath0-level @xcite .",
    "their experimental result with statistical and systematical error was given by : @xmath1 unfortunately , on february , 2012 two error sources had become evident , which were likely to ruin their result .",
    "first , a fiber connection to a computer card had not been attached properly .",
    "second , there had been a problem with the clock at opera used between the synchronizations with the global positioning system .    at the 25th international conference on neutrino physics and astrophysics in kyoto on june 8th , 2012 a final update on the opera time - of - flight measurement",
    "was given : @xmath2 this number states the deviation of the muon neutrino time - of - flight from the time that light needs to travel the distance from cern to the gran sasso underground laboratory .",
    "hence , the deviation is now consistent with zero .",
    "the physics community had considered the result given by eq .   with care , since the deviation from the speed of light lay several orders of magnitude above what would be expected , if it was from quantum gravitational origin .",
    "the authors of @xcite tried to figure out how the opera result could be explained by possible systematical errors . beyond that , in @xcite a cross - check for the result was proposed .",
    "it was demonstrated that muon neutrinos traveling with superluminal velocity can produce signatures for highly - boosted @xmath3-quark pairs at the lhc , where one or both quarks decay semileptonically .",
    "furthermore , on the one hand , cohen and glashow showed that a superluminal neutrino would lose its energy quickly by the emission of electron positron pairs @xcite .",
    "if muon neutrinos moved faster than light , the process @xmath4 would be energetically possible above a certain neutrino energy threshold resulting in a copious production of electron positron pairs .",
    "on the other hand , the authors of @xcite discussed that the cohen ",
    "glashow constraint can be avoided",
    ". this may be the case when , for example , lorentz - violating effects depend quadratically on the neutrino energy or if lorentz - violation is not fixed but covariant with the neutrino four - momentum",
    ".    in @xcite two models were investigated , where the first gave rise to deformed energy conservation laws and the second resulted in deformed momentum conservation laws . for these models the bounds of @xcite are not applicable .    in the article @xcite",
    "further constraints on the deviation of the neutrino velocity from the speed of light were given by considering pion decay and tev - neutrinos detected by icecube .",
    "these gave severe bounds on lorentz symmetry violation in the neutrino sector clashing with the experimental opera result .",
    "although the opera result has now proven to be wrong , it stimulated theoretical ideas in this field and led to many new models , which can perhaps be applied to other realms of physics .",
    "it may also be the case that a certain neutrino species indeed travels superluminally .",
    "however , the deviation from the speed of light is then expected to be much smaller than the value measured by opera . for this reason some representative examples for models that try to describe superluminal neutrinos will be listed :    * it is well - known that dispersion relations of particles will be modified , if they propagate through a medium . in @xcite the superluminal motion of muon neutrinos is interpreted in the framework of deformed dispersion relations , which are a low - energy manifestation of lorentz - violating physics at the planck scale . in these theories",
    "the vacuum behaves as an effective medium .",
    "+ such a medium can result from standard model physics , as well .",
    "for example , in @xcite superluminal neutrinos are explained by the assumption that earth is surrounded by a special kind of matter consisting of separated quarks .",
    "if the wave functions of quarks are entangled , they can form colorless objects and , hence , are confined , even when they are spatially separated by a large distance . * in @xcite a model",
    "is proposed which describes a spontaneous breakdown of lorentz symmetry by a scalar background field that is added to the action via a lagrange multiplier .",
    "this framework leads to a modified neutrino dispersion relation depending on the momentum of the neutrino . *",
    "the neutrino velocity can be modified by fermi point splitting ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , which removes the degeneracy of zeros of the fermionic energy spectrum @xcite . * the neutrino dispersion relation can change because of environmental effects caused by fields that accumulate at the position of the earth .",
    "these may lead to an effective metric , in which the neutrino propagates with superluminal velocity @xcite .",
    "that is characteristic for the model presented in @xcite . ]",
    "furthermore , in the context of general relativity , a particle traveling along a geodesic path in a metric different from the minkowski metric can be investigated @xcite . in the article",
    "previously mentioned the mean velocity of such a particle is calculated with the assumption that the observer stays at rest .",
    "the average velocity can be larger than the speed of light , even if the velocity as a local property defined in a spacetime point is smaller .",
    "this is investigated for a schwarzschild metric . *",
    "a further alternative is to consider models of modified gravity . in the article @xcite",
    "particle propagation in a hoava - lifshitz modified gravitational background is considered .",
    "the authors derive the dirac equation for a fermion traveling through such a background .",
    "the condition for the existence of nontrivial solutions of the dirac equation leads to a modified neutrino dispersion relation .",
    "the neutrino velocity can be larger than the speed of light for a special hoava - lifshitz scenario . * in @xcite the existence of a sterile neutrino that travels with a superluminal velocity",
    "is proposed .",
    "sterile neutrinos cleverly get around the cohen ",
    "glashow bound , since they do not couple to the z boson .",
    "an analysis involving sterile superluminal neutrinos is presented e.g. in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , assuming superluminal neutrino propagation at a certain energy , neutrinos may propagate with a velocity @xmath5 at very high energies leading to a different neutrino horizon . in @xcite bounds from astrophysical observations",
    "are set on @xmath6 for very high neutrino energies .",
    "let us , for now , take eq .",
    "as it stands , since the idea of superluminal muon neutrinos proposed in the current article is purely theoretical and does not rely on the opera result .",
    "the goal is to describe a superluminal neutrino species without quantum gravity effects , but by the introduction of new particles coupling to neutrinos . for the analysis presented as follows",
    "the opera value can be chosen just as an example ( independently of its correctness ) in order to demonstrate the model proposed .",
    "that is why we will often refer to eq .   in the rest of the paper .",
    "the foundations of special relativity are the relativity principle and the _ constancy _ ( _ invariance _ ) of the speed of light . as a result ,",
    "the galilei group of classical mechanics is replaced by the lorentz group , which leads , for example , to the relativistic law of addition of velocities .",
    "the fact that the speed of light is the maximum attainable velocity of all particles does not directly follow from the lorentz group , since it only delivers an _ invariant _",
    "velocity at first . in order to understand this , three",
    "_ gedankenexperiments _ will be performed , whose concept was initiated in @xcite .",
    "* we consider some hypothetical beings living in a fluid .",
    "they are assumed to consist of fluid atoms , which are held together solely by phonon - mediated forces .",
    "the beings do not feel other forces such as electromagnetism or gravitation .",
    "their dynamics is expected to be governed by an acoustic lorentz group with the invariant velocity being the velocity of sound @xmath7 in the fluid @xcite .",
    "we expect the beings to build a rocket , which can be accelerated by phonon emission . from the relativistic addition of velocities",
    "it follows that the maximum attainable velocity of the rocket is given by @xmath7 .",
    "* einstein found that the dynamics of particles in our universe is governed by the `` standard '' lorentz group with the invariant speed of light @xmath8 .",
    "his theory has been heralded or substantiated by various experiments @xcite . in the second _ gedankenexperiment _ humans build a rocket which is accelerated by a light engine , namely the emission of photons . in this case",
    ", the relativistic addition of velocities leads to @xmath8 as the upper limit of the rocket velocity .",
    "* now we are ready to discuss the central idea of this article .",
    "the basic assumption is that the photon is _ not _ the gauge boson which moves with the highest velocity .",
    "we adopt neutrinos carrying a new charge @xmath9 differing from all charges of the standard model .",
    "this charge is to be mediated by a postulated massless gauge boson @xmath10 moving with a speed @xmath11 .",
    "neutrinos couple to these gauge bosons , which form  possibly together with other unknown particles  a hidden sector .",
    "the latter does not interact with any other particle of the standard model , cf .",
    "[ fig : toy - model - opera - neutrinos - hidden - sector ] .",
    "this leads to a neutrino dynamics which is based on a `` hidden sector lorentz group '' with an invariant velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the third _ gedankenexperiment _ is to build a rocket consisting of neutrinos with an acceleration process working by the emission of gauge bosons @xmath10 .",
    "the limiting velocity of the rocket is then given by @xmath12 , which is larger than the speed of light .",
    "the consequences from this deliberation is that different levels of the lorentz group each with a distinct invariant velocity can be realized in nature .",
    "the coupling constant is assumed to be small enough such that neutrino propagation is not affected too much to violate existing bounds on the interaction of neutrinos with matter .",
    "the size of the coupling is not important for now  only its existence .",
    "the situation described is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy - model - opera - neutrinos - invariant - velocities_fig02 ] .",
    "each new coupling of particles to massless gauge bosons opens a new sector with a maximum attainable velocity for these particles from left to right .",
    "the gauge boson @xmath13 is assumed to couple to neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "this seems a more natural choice than the coupling to flavor eigenstates , since the hidden sector does not know anything about neutrino flavors .",
    "hence , the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) obey a kinematics resting upon special relativity , but with the speed of light replaced by the speed @xmath12 of the hidden sector gauge boson @xmath10 : @xmath16 \\notag \\\\ & = \\mathcal{g}p_{\\upnu } c\\biggl[1+\\frac{\\mathcal{g}^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_ic}{p_{\\upnu}}\\right)^2\\biggr]\\,,\\quad \\mathcal{g}=\\frac{\\widehat{c}}{c}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the relativistic neutrino energy of the @xmath18-th mass eigenstate , @xmath19 the neutrino momentum , and @xmath20 its mass .. whenever we refer to kinematics we stick to the notation of @xmath21 with an index ( denoting the mass or flavor eigenstate ) for the neutrino mass . ]",
    "the modified neutrino dispersion relation in eq .   is isotropic and @xmath22 gives the deformation .",
    "if we suppress the mass eigenstate index @xmath18 for a moment and interpret neutrinos as matter waves with frequency @xmath23 and three - momentum @xmath24 , we have to carry out the replacements @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which leads to : @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ] the front velocity , which corresponds to the velocity of the highest frequency forerunners of a wave , is then given by @xcite : @xmath28 it equals the signal velocity of a @xmath29-function shaped pulse in configuration space .",
    "hence , any possible distortion of a signal does not play a role for the front velocity .",
    "the case @xmath30 is related to superluminal , @xmath31 to luminal , and @xmath32 to subluminal motion .",
    "if the gauge boson @xmath10 is assumed to have spin 1 analogously to the photon , at the level of lagrange densities the ordinary minimal coupling procedure can be performed with @xmath8 again replaced by @xmath12 :    [ eq : lagrangian - hidden - sector ] @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39    where @xmath40 are the neutrino spinor fields describing a specific mass eigenstate and @xmath41 are the standard dirac matrices .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath42 contains the vector field @xmath43 of the gauge boson @xmath10 and the charge @xmath9 , to which @xmath10 couples .",
    "both a dirac mass term and two possible choices for majorana mass terms @xcite with dirac mass @xmath44 and majorana masses @xmath45 , @xmath46 are given .",
    "here , @xmath47 is a left - handed , @xmath48 a right - handed neutrino spinor , and @xmath49 in eq .   denotes the charge conjugation operator .",
    "note that there is a @xmath12 in the zeroth component of the partial derivative @xmath50 . in the context of the lorentz - violating standard model extension @xcite the nonzero lorentz - violating coefficients can be found in the left - handed neutrino sector of @xmath51 in their eq .",
    "if we write this term in the mass eigenstate basis and denote the corresponding coefficients by @xmath52 , the @xmath52-matrix is both diagonal in the eigenstate coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath53 and diagonal in the lorentz indices .",
    "the latter holds , since the model is isotropic .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 the coefficient matrix @xmath55 is both symmetric and traceless : @xmath56 this resembles the _",
    "cpt_-even nonbirefringent modified maxwell theory coefficients @xmath57 in the photon sector @xcite , which is clear , since both sectors are related by a coordinate transformation  at least at first order in the lorentz - violating coefficients @xcite .",
    "the neutrino masses @xmath20 are eigenvalues to the mass eigenstates @xmath58 .",
    "however , the weak interaction gauge bosons couple to flavor eigenstates @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the transformation from mass to flavor eigenstates and ( vice versa ) is governed by the unitary @xmath61-pnms matrix  @xmath62 :    @xmath63    when , for simplicity , the _ cp_-violating phases are set to zero , the matrix @xmath62 reads @xmath64    where , for brevity , @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been used @xcite . here , @xmath67 for @xmath68 are the neutrino mixing angles .",
    "kinematik measurements of neutrino masses ( e.g. for pion decay and beta decay ) lead to `` masses of neutrino flavors , '' which are the weighted average of the neutrino mass eigenvalues @xcite :    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    since in eq .",
    "the neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath20 are multiplied by @xmath72 , the maximum velocity of each neutrino flavor will be defined in the following way :    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    if we assume    @xmath76    @xmath77    it is sufficient to linearize the equations above : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 . from the latter equation follows the simplified result    [ eq : connection - between - calpha - and - ci ] @xmath80 @xmath81    in the rest of the article the neutrino velocities will be approximated by @xmath82 for the mass eigenstates and by @xmath83 for the flavor eigenstates , since neutrino masses are assumed to be much smaller than neutrino energies .",
    "the point of extending the toy model to all active neutrino flavors , is to account for the supernova 1987 ( sn 1987 ) bound on electron antineutrinos for a brief discussion concerning this issue . ] @xcite : @xmath84\\,\\mathrm{mev}})-c}{c}\\right|\\lesssim 2\\cdot 10^{-9}\\,.\\ ] ] an electron neutrino produced by a weak interaction process is a mixture of neutrino mass eigenstates according to the relation @xmath85 after the neutrino has traveled through space and reaches a distance @xmath86 from the origin of its production it holds @xmath87|\\nu_{\\beta}\\rangle\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 has been assumed @xcite .",
    "hence , the initial electron neutrino state then corresponds to a mixture of all flavor eigenstates .",
    "however , the initial composition of mass eigenstates remains the same , because quantum mechanically the statement @xmath89 is valid . as a result of that , also the velocity of the neutrino does not change during its propagation , since it is determined by the initial composition of mass eigenstates .",
    "the antineutrinos coming from the supernova were detected as electron antineutrinos on earth .",
    "for this reason the bound of eq .   will be considered as a bound on the velocity of electron neutrinos  regardless of whether their flavor was different on their way to earth .",
    "we assume three distinct hidden sectors each with its own gauge boson @xmath90 , where @xmath91 only couples to the first mass eigenstate , @xmath92 to the second , and @xmath93 to the third , via the respective charge @xmath94 for @xmath95 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . if any sector obeys a different invariant velocity @xmath96 , the constraint of eq .",
    "does not necessarily contradict a deviation from the speed of light of the order of @xmath97 for one single neutrino flavor .",

    "this means @xmath105 from neutrino oscillation data @xcite and should be replaced by @xmath106 , as well .",
    "but since the mass values given have been obtained in the context of special relativity , where the speed of light @xmath8 is the invariant velocity , we keep @xmath8 . ]",
    "@xmath107 which is obtained from wmap observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , an approximate value of @xmath108 directly follows from eq .  :",
    "@xmath109 assuming @xmath110 and @xmath111 we obtain : according to eqs .   and .",
    "we keep in mind that the constraints on @xmath112 and @xmath113 were obtained at different neutrino energies , but this does not play a role in our model , though . ]",
    "@xmath114 hence , eq .   for muon neutrinos and the sn 1987 bound for electron neutrinos do not clash ,",
    "if the velocity of the first mass eigenstate is a little bit lower than @xmath8 and if the second moves faster than @xmath8 . since the first eigenstate propagates slower than @xmath8 , it need not necessarily couple to any hidden sector .",
    "in contrast , the second mass eigenstate has to couple to a @xmath92 traveling faster than light .",
    "the argument of @xcite resulting in the rapid loss of the neutrino energy by electron positron emission relies on fundamental principles : four - momentum conservation and the coupling of the neutrino sector to the z boson .",
    "models for superluminal neutrino propagation have to compete with the very general result mentioned , and this is also the case for the toy model presented here .    * we could assume the energy loss of muon neutrinos to be compensated by a compton scattering type process , where gauge bosons @xmath13 scatter with muon neutrinos . however , this argument leads to additional problems .",
    "first of all , the free parameters of the model ( e.g. the charge @xmath9 or the initial energy of a @xmath13 boson ) have to be chosen such that this compensation is possible , which requires extreme finetuning .",
    "if the momentum distribution of @xmath10 is homogeneous and isotropic , the average energy transfer to the neutrino will be zero . in principle , the distribution may be anisotropic , but then neutrinos might be deflected on their way from cern to the gran sasso underground laboratory . *",
    "an alternative proposal is that a neutrino itself is part of the hidden sector making it to some kind of superluminal , _ sterile _ neutrino @xmath115 .",
    "then the neutrino does not couple to the z boson , rendering the process @xmath116 forbidden .",
    "the sterile neutrino may mix with the active neutrino species leading to superluminal propagation of at least some of the standard model neutrino flavors .",
    "this idea has already been suggested in other publications , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "reference @xcite states that sterile neutrino models may be in conflict with the atmospheric neutrino data measured at super - kamiokande . however , the models considered in the latter article only involve one sterile neutrino and one single mixing angle with this neutrino .",
    "conclusions for models with more mixing angles have not been obtained .    according to the second item of the list above , we extend the toy model by @xmath117 sterile neutrino mass eigenstates . then the transformation between the @xmath118 flavor and mass eigenstates",
    "is governed by a unitary  @xmath119-matrix @xmath120 : @xmath121 following eq .",
    "we can write : @xmath122 for our toy model we consider the simplest case with one single sterile neutrino , hence @xmath123 . in principle",
    ", this sterile neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath124 mixes with the active neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "this mixing can be described by introducing three additional mixing angles @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath128-mixing matrix @xmath120 can then be constructed from @xmath62 as follows : @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "in what follows , we examine a subspace of the free toy model parameters , which is seven - dimensional .",
    "it is spanned by the three sterile neutrino mixing angles @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and by the invariant velocities of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "since this phase space is that large , it will be reduced by the special choice below .",
    "we assume that the invariant velocities of the three standard neutrino mass eigenstates correspond to the speed of light , which means @xmath135 .",
    "the single sterile neutrino is assumed to travel with superluminal speed : we therefore set @xmath136 .",
    "as a result , only the sterile mixing angles remain as free parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy - model - opera - neutrinos - regionplot ] three cases are considered , where in each one of these angles is fixed : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 .",
    "we would like to explore , whether in each case the remaining two angles can be chosen such that the electron anti - neutrino velocity respects the sn 1987 bound of eq .   and that the muon neutrino velocity lies in the error band of eq .  .",
    "in all plots overlapping regions are small , but they exist .",
    "at least one of the three mixing angles has to be rather large .",
    "a special possibility is @xmath140 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 that becomes evident from the third panel . with these values",
    "we obtain the following results for the velocities of the three active neutrino flavors :    @xmath141    @xmath142    @xmath143    whether there exists a choice of angles that does not contradict existing atmospheric neutrino data  as was proposed in @xcite  will not be examined here .    to summarize , within the toy model presented a superluminal sterile neutrino mass eigenstate can be introduced , such that the electron neutrino respects the sn 1987 bound and the muon neutrino travels with the superluminal velocity that is given by eq .",
    "for the parameters chosen above the tau neutrino is then slightly superluminal , as well .",
    "in this article a concept accounting for superluminal muon neutrinos was presented .",
    "it is based on a multiple lorentz group structure .",
    "the dynamics of the neutrino is assumed to obey the lorentz group with an invariant velocity that is larger than the speed of light .",
    "this will be possible , if the neutrino couples to a hidden sector of massless gauge bosons that move faster than photons .",
    "then the neutrino field transforms under the lorentz group with an invariant velocity which corresponds to the velocity of these gauge bosons .",
    "if an experiment measures a deviation of the neutrino velocity that is much larger than the speed of light , this will be very difficult to understand in the context of physics at the planck scale .",
    "the idea presented here leads , in principle , to a modified dispersion relation of the neutrino , as well .",
    "however , the framework is not quantum gravity , but special relativity and field theory with an invariant velocity imposed that differs from the speed of light .",
    "first of all , every physical model describing superluminal muon neutrinos has to compete with the sn 1987 bound .",
    "this is a minor difficulty , since the toy model presented here can be altered such that electron neutrinos behave differently compared to muon neutrinos .",
    "more severe is the cohen ",
    "glashow constraint that is based on fundamental principles of present - day physics , which are difficult to circumvent .",
    "honestly , the latter is also a severe problem for the current model , unless the superluminal neutrino itself is part of a hidden sector , hence sterile .",
    "besides that , the toy model makes the following predictions that can be verified or falsified by experiment :    * if the muon neutrino moves with a superluminal velocity , its velocity is isotropic and does not depend on the neutrino energy ( besides any mass - related dependence ) . *",
    "it is _ not _ a local effect , i.e. muon neutrinos move with a superluminal velocity in interstellar space , as well .    to find a physical theory both explaining superluminal neutrinos without bothering already established data and facts about the neutrino sector",
    "is a great challenge for model builders .",
