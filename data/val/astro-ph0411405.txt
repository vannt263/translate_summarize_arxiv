    "galaxy interactions have been known for a long time to trigger star formation , although both observations and numerical simulations have shown that the enhancement of star formation depends , among other factors , on the orbital geometry of the encounter . in some situations interactions",
    "might even suppress star formation .",
    "hence , the star formation properties of interacting systems may serve as a clue to their interaction history .    here",
    "we analyse the star formation properties of three nearby galaxy systems in differing evolutionary phases : the weakly interacting triplet am 1238 - 362 @xcite , the strongly interacting compact galaxy group scg 0018 - 4854 @xcite , and the merging compact group cg j1720 - 67.8 @xcite .",
    "the first two systems are at comparable distances ( 48 and 45.5 mpc , respectively , assuming h@xmath1 = 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) , close enough to allow us to study the luminosity and size distribution of the hii regions in the individual galaxies .",
    "the third system , at a distance of 180 mpc , does not offer us the possibility to study the properties of individual hii regions .",
    "however , the general distribution of the ionized gas across the whole group and its velocity field can be used to guess the evolutionary status of the group .",
    "we interpret our ( in some cases still preliminary ) results taking into account star formation properties of other nearby galaxies @xcite and numerical simulations from the literature ( e.g. mihos , bothun , & richstone 1993 ) .",
    "am 1238 - 362 is a fairly tight triple system composed by two nearly face - on ( eso 381-g009 and tol 1238 - 36.4 ) and an edge - on ( eso 381-g006 ) spiral galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ am_a ] ) . a detailed study of the morphological and spectrophotometric properties of the two face - on galaxies has been presented in temporin et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , where the interaction signatures and star formation properties have been discussed in the framework of the evolutionary history of the system .",
    "the two galaxies exhibit enhanced star formation activity , and the radial and azimuthal distribution of their h@xmath0 emission show a tendency for both disks to concentrate the star formation activity on the side facing the companion ( see temporin et al .",
    "2003a , fig .",
    "20 ) . here",
    "we make use of h@xmath0 narrow - band imaging obtained at the eso - mpia 2.2 m telescope ( see the above cited work for details on observations and data reduction ) to further investigate the star formation properties of these mildly interacting galaxies . in particular we measured the h@xmath0 luminosities and the sizes of the individual hii regions in order to analyse their luminosity functions ( lfs ) and size distributions .",
    "the regions were identified and measured in automated way with the hiiphot algorithm @xcite , choosing as a detection threshold a signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath3 5@xmath4 . the lfs are shown in fig .",
    "weighted least square fits to the regions in the luminosity range where lfs were believed to be complete were obtained assuming a standard power - law distribution with index @xmath0 .",
    "similarly we obtained power - law fits to the size distributions of the hii regions .",
    "the slope @xmath5 of the size distribution is expected to be related to that of the lf by the relation @xmath6 @xcite . for tol 1238 - 36.4 , a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) classified as an sb(rs)bc",
    ", we obtained @xmath0 = @xmath7 2.36@xmath80.16 , in good agreement with expectations for its morphological type @xcite , and @xmath5 = @xmath7 4.61@xmath80.62 , in agreement ( within errors ) with the above relation .",
    "however , we observe a uniform shift of the lf towards higher luminosities by about one order of magnitude with respect to other nearby star - forming spiral galaxies ( e.g. thilker et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this feature of the lf is typical of lirgs ( see also alonso - herrero , these proceedings ) . in this particular case",
    ", the high luminosity of the hii regions could be a consequence of the increased star formation activity triggered by the interaction .",
    "since the influence of the agn is mostly confined within the central kpc @xcite , we rule out the possibility of a significant cotribution to the ionization by the central agn . for eso 381-g009",
    ", the slope of the lf strongly depends on the choice of the fitted luminosity range .",
    "the steeper slope ( @xmath0 = @xmath72.17@xmath80.34 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ am_b ] , obtained for regions with @xmath9(l@xmath10 ) @xmath3 39.5 , is in good agreement with the slope of the size distribution .",
    "the h@xmath0 image revealed also the presence of 12 emission - line point - like sources in the intergalactic space .",
    "their projected distances to the nearest galaxy range between 12 and 68 kpc and their h@xmath0 luminosities are in the range 0.6 - 7.4 @xmath11 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "these could be intergalactic hii regions similar to those recently found in other interacting systems or around cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "this strongly interacting galaxy group is composed by a tight quartet @xcite and a concordant redshift spiral galaxy ( eso 194-g13 ) @xmath13 12 arcmin apart . all members exhibit strong signs of disturbances , the most outstanding being the @xmath13 30 kpc - long tidal tail of ngc 92 . here",
    "we present a preliminary analysis of the h@xmath0 images of the 5 galaxies .",
    "the observations were carried out in 2002 september and 2003 january at the eso - vlt - ut4 telescope equipped with fors2 .",
    "the h@xmath0 images were reduced in a standard way and flux - calibrated by means of a standard star observed during the same nights , taking into account the filter transmission curve and the contribution from the [ nii ] @xmath14 6548 , 6583 emission lines .",
    "appropriately scaled r - band images were used for the continuum subtraction .    in three of the galaxies ,",
    "individual hii regions were detected in sufficient number to allow us the construction of lfs and size distributions ( fig .",
    "[ lf_scg0018 ] ) . the same method described in section  2 was adopted .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the lf of ngc 92 exhibit a considerable flattening at the high luminosity end .",
    "this effect is not shared by the companion galaxies , so it might be a real feature , rather than an artificial effect due to source blending .",
    "when the highest luminosity hii regions are excluded from the fit of the lf , we obtain a slope @xmath0 = @xmath71.73@xmath80.11 consistent with the morphological type and in agreement , within errors , with the observed size distribution ( @xmath5 = @xmath73.71@xmath80.54 ) .",
    "some excess of relatively high luminosity hii regions is observed also in eso 194-g13 , but we can not exclude that this smaller effect is due to source blending , especially in the central part of the galaxy , where the spatial density of hii regions appears higher . the observed size distribution is steeper than expected ( @xmath5 = @xmath75.46@xmath80.40 ) , if the slope of the lf , @xmath0 = @xmath71.90@xmath80.37 , is considered .",
    "the lf of ngc 87 is based on the only 56 hii regions detected with s / n @xmath3 5@xmath4 . also in this case the lf slope ( @xmath0 = @xmath71.55@xmath80.11 ) ,",
    "although consistent with the late morphological type of the galaxy ( ibm pec ) , does not agree with the slope of the size distribution ( @xmath5 = @xmath73.57@xmath80.73 ) .",
    "for the two remaining galaxies no hii region lf could be built .",
    "none the less , the h@xmath0 images show interesting features .",
    "ngc 88 , apart from the bulk of emission stemming from its central part , shows h@xmath0 emission in two plume - like features .",
    "ngc 89 , besides hosting a seyfert 2 nucleus , shows a ring of circumnuclear hii regions and two - sided extraplanar h@xmath0 emitting features , including a jet - like structure with a projected length of @xmath13 4 kpc whose nature is yet to be established ( fig .",
    "[ lf_scg0018 ] ) .",
    "this extremely dense , low velocity dispersion compact group is composed by two actively star - forming spirals and one lenticular galaxy with a small amount of central star formation @xcite .",
    "a @xmath13 29 kpc - long tidal tail hosts a number of candidate proto - tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite . as shown in the h@xmath0 map ( fig .",
    "[ hamap ] ) reconstructed from integral field spectra obtained at the aat 3.9 m telescope ( see temporin , staveley - smith , &  kerber 2004 for a detailed description and analysis of the data set ) , the star formation activity is spread all across the group , with as much as 31 per cent of the entire h@xmath0 emission stemming from the long tidal tail .",
    "such an activity is clearly related to the undergoing merging process .",
    "the velocity field of the ionized gas ( fig .",
    "[ vfield ] ) helps constraining the group dynamics and favours the idea of a prograde - retrograde @xmath15 200 myr - old encounter between the two spiral galaxies . while the estimated age of the tidal tail well agrees with the burst age of the two spiral galaxies , the knots in the tidal tail show evidence of more recent star formation events ( < 10 myr ) , supporting the idea that the condensations of gas and stars have formed under the action of self - gravity within the tail",
    "all three systems , although in different phases of interaction , present a clear enhancement of star formation , which appears related to the interaction process .",
    "this suggests encounter geometries favouring the onset of bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "the slopes of the hii region lfs mostly agree with the expectations for the relevant morphological types ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 ) , although some peculiarities are present .",
    "our main results on the individual systems are listed below .    _",
    "am 1238 - 362 .",
    "_ the distribution of hii regions across the disks of the two face - on members seems related to the interaction .",
    "their hii region lfs , presented here for the first time , considerably differ from one another , although the size distributions do not .",
    "the shift of the lf of tol 1238 - 36.4 towards high luminosities is possibly a consequence of the interaction process . in this system",
    "we do not observe the tendency suggested by frattare , keel , &  laurikainen ( 1993 ) for interacting galaxies to have flatter hii region lfs than normal galaxies .",
    "candidate intergalactic hii regions have been identified in the space between the galaxies , however , spectroscopic confirmation is needed .",
    "no obvious correlation is found between the position of these sources and the distribution of hi @xcite .",
    "_ scg 0018 - 4854 . _",
    "all five galaxies show active star formation . a preliminary analysis of the hii region lfs of three members of this compact group",
    "do show some peculiarities , especially a considerable flattening of the lf of ngc 92 at the high luminosity end .",
    "a certain amount of flattening could be caused by blending of hii regions , an effect that might become important at a distance of 45 mpc .",
    "however , since such an effect was not observed in the other galaxies of the group , nor in am 1238 - 362 ( located at similar distance ) , we exclude this as the only reason for the observed flattening .",
    "we plan to investigate separately the lfs of the regions located in the tidal tail and in the galaxy body , where they are organized in circumnuclear rings .",
    "two of the galaxies appear to have hii region size distributions steeper than expected , given the observed lfs .",
    "possible reasons for this effect are yet to be investigated .",
    "_ cg j1720 - 67.8 .",
    "_ in this dense system , the merging process is undoubtedly responsible for the ubiquitous star formation and the formation of ( candidate ) proto - tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "the velocity field of the ionized gas , besides helping to constrain the interaction history of the group , shows an interesting feature , i.e. a @xmath13 5 kpc offset of kinematic center with respect to the photometric center of the central spiral galaxy , in north - west direction along its kinematic minor axis ( temporin et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we speculate that this might hint at the presence of a common dark matter halo in the system .    in this work we made use of the hiiphot algorithm available at the ftp site : ftp://ftp.aoc.nrao.edu / staff / dthilker / hiiphot_code/. st acknowledges financial support by the european southern observatory and is grateful for hospitality at the eso - la silla headquarter and at the astronomy department of padova university during the preparation of parts of this work .",
