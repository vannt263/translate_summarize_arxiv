    "in particular we consider nonlinear effects on plasma waves due to scattering off thermal ions and density inhomogeneities .",
    "we begin , however , with a brief outline of the main features of the relaxation process  ( for a detailed description see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we thus obtain @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the total energy density in langmuir waves at @xmath143 , i.e. non - resonant with the beam .",
    "this energy density is excited by the non - linear scattering process and for the most part is dissipated by coulomb collisions at a rate @xmath117 ( see further discussion below ) .",

    "thus , the beam emission of langmuir waves is only linear in time , with an average power @xmath151 , and the beam relaxation timescale at redshift @xmath116 is : @xmath152 the above timescale should be compared with the pairs cooling time on the cosmic microwave background , @xmath153 yr . the ratio of these timescales is plotted in fig .",

    "the plot shows that the assumption of collisional dissipation of the long wavelength langmuir waves is always valid except at short distances from low redshift blazars .",
    "the modulation instability deserves more attention that the scope of the current paper can afford .",
    "here we notice that , while the modulation instability could stabilize the beam  @xcite , it could also provides an effective dissipation rate that is more efficient than collisions . in this case",
    "the level of energy density of resonant waves , @xmath146 , will increase with consequent reduction of the beam lifetime ( see eq .",
    "[ weq : eq]-[taubeam : eq ] ) .",

    "[ mit : eq ] ) , should the background plasma suffers even modest heating caused by the beam relaxation , the modulation instability will quickly stabilize ( at below the mpc scale ) , restoring the conditions for collisional dissipation of the nonresonant waves .",

    "[ fgm : se ] it appears that the beam is stable at basically all relevant distances from the blazar . as a result ,",
    "the beam instability plays only a secondary role on the electromagnetic shower , the beam dynamics and the thermal history of the igm .",
    "in addition to the kinetic effects described above , the energy density of the plasma waves evolves in time due to spatial gradients effects according to @xmath158 where for the rate of change of the wave - vector we have used the equation of geometric optics @xmath159 the first and second terms on the rhs of ( [ dwdt : eq ] ) describe as usual explicit time dependence and the effects of spatial gradients discussed at the beginning of sec .",

    "the last term describes the change in @xmath160 associated with modifications of the waves wave - vector as a result of inhomogeneities .",

    "accordingly , the distance covered by the beam particles during the fastest growth time , @xmath179 1 kpc , is much shorter than the typical scale - length of density gradients .",
