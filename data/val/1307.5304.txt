    "the advent of the big data revolution has opened the door to the analysis of massive datasets on all aspects of society .",
    "new technologies have made possible the access to unprecedented amount of information on human behavior generated unobtrusively whenever people interact with or through modern technologies such as cell phones , online services , mobile applications , etc .",
    "this fact is facilitating the pursuit of a computational approach to the study of problems traditionally associated with social sciences  @xcite .",
    "over the course of the last few years , it has allowed for the development of greater insights , for instance , into human mobility  @xcite , structure of online social networks  @xcite , cognitive limitations  @xcite , information diffusion and social contagion  @xcite , the importance of social groups  @xcite or even how political movements raise and develop  @xcite .",
    "the relation between physical location and social interactions can be also explored with the new available data . in general , people tend to interact and maintain relations with geographically close peers . a tendency that gets reflected in a decay of the social interaction probability with the physical distance .",
    "this effect has been observed , for example , in phone call records @xcite and in online friendships  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that online  @xcite social links can be inferred from user co - occurrences in space and time and , likewise , that the location of a person can be predicted from the geographic positions of his or her online friends  @xcite .",
    "some further aspects of the relation between geography and online social contacts have been studied such as the probability that a link at a given distance closes a triangle  @xcite , the connections between users in different countries  @xcite , the social interactions and mobility in emergency situations  @xcite or the overlap between users ego networks and how it decays with the distance  @xcite .",
    "multi - parametric inference methods have been applied to empirical data with the aim of predicting link presence and users locations  @xcite .",
    "these works show that the accuracy of link prediction is considerably improved by taking into account the geographical information , and that the accuracy of location prediction is enhanced when the online social links are provided .",
    "the availability of geo - localized information has also allowed for a detailed exploration of human mobility  @xcite .",
    "the length of displacements between locations was found to follow a broad distribution , well fitted by a power - law decaying function  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the travels was studied by considering ellipsoidal boundaries to the average individual displacements and analyzing the scaling of the radius of gyration .",
    "memory effects in the individual displacements was also analyzed , finding that individuals home and workplace have a considerable impact on their mobility patterns @xcite .",
    "these results motivated the introduction of several mobility models with the aim of explaining the features observed in the data  @xcite . despite the supporting evidence @xcite ,",
    "most of these models lack a connection between mobility and social interactions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we lay a bridge between these two worlds by introducing a model coupling social tie formation and spatial mobility .",
    "preceding models considering network structure and geography are uncoupled @xcite .",
    "our model simulates the movement of individuals and creates links between them when they are physically close mimicking the effect of face - to - face interactions .",
    "we study the model both numerically and analytically and confront its results with empirical data obtained from three online social networks .",
    "we show that the model generates more realistic networks than uncoupled models .",
    "we have collected data from online social networks containing both social links and information about the users physical positions .",
    "the first dataset was obtained from twitter by means of its api  @xcite .",
    "we identify over @xmath0 single users , who tweeted using a gps enabled mobile device during the month of august @xmath1  @xcite . if those users reported various locations in different tweets , the most recent one is taken for the purpose of the study .",
    "the other two datasets contain information referring to the users location check - ins and the social networks of gowalla and brightkite  @xcite . both were location - based online social networks , in which users can check - in at their current locations and receive information about services in the area as well as about their friends positions .",
    "gowalla and brightkite are no longer active but their data is available online  @xcite .",
    "the main statistical features of our three datasets are displayed in table  [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "social interactions across country borders have particular properties and are affected by political , linguistic or cultural factors .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by restricting our analysis to the networks within each country .",
    "intra - country mobility and social contacts account for the large majority of a user activity  @xcite . for simplicity , we focus on the three major countries with more than one thousand users in each of our datasets : the united states ( us ) , the united kingdom ( uk ) and germany ( de ) . we have analyzed and modeled other countries and found similar results to the ones presented in this manuscript",
    ".    .*datasets . *",
    "number of users ( nodes ) @xmath2 and of links @xmath3 of the networks obtained from the different geo - localized datasets for the united states ( us ) , the united kingdom ( uk ) and germany ( de ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the geo - social properties of the networks generated by the tf model are shown in figure  5 for the us and in supplementary figures  [ supfig_3 ] and [ supfig_4 ] for the uk and germany , respectively .",
    "additionally , we show how each of the introduced properties contributes to the total error of the model in table  [ tab : partialerr ] .",
    "the model is able to reproduce the trends in the probability @xmath4 , the reciprocity @xmath5 , the social overlap @xmath6 and the disparity distribution @xmath7 with good accuracy .",
    "the difficulties encountered with the degree distribution @xmath8 and the clustering as a function of the distance @xmath9 are not unexpected since the model does not incorporate mechanisms to explicitly enhance the heterogeneity in the agents contacts nor favor any specific dependence of the clustering on the distance .      in this section",
    "we explore two null models uncoupling mobility and social interactions to help us interpret the mechanisms acting in the tf model .",
    "the first null model , the spatial model ( s model ) , is based solely on the geography and consists of randomly connecting pair of users with a probability depending on the distance , but does not take network structure into account .",
    "the second null model , the linking model ( l model ) , in contrast , is based only on random linking and triadic closure , and it is equivalent to the tf model without the mobility .",
    "we consider the two uncoupled null models and compare their results with those of the tf model . in this way",
    ", we demonstrate the importance of the coupling through a realistic mobility mechanism to reproduce the empirical networks .    the spatial model ( s model ) consists of randomly connecting pair of users with a probability that decays as power - law of the distance between them ( suggested in  @xcite ) .",
    "the exponent of the power - law is fixed at @xmath10 following figure  2a .",
    "the results of the s model are shown in the panels of figure  2 . while it is set to match @xmath4 , other properties such as @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 or @xmath7 are not well reproduced .",
    "the s model fails to account for the high level of clustering and reciprocity in the empirical networks and for their dependence on the distance .",
    "the error @xmath12 of this null model is between @xmath13-@xmath14 for the three countries , around twice the error of the tf model ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "the linking model ( l model ) is a simplified version of the tf model , without random mobility and the box size @xmath15 .",
    "agents move to visit their contacts with probability @xmath16 , whereas with probability @xmath17 they do not perform any action . in this version of the model",
    ", users can connect only by random connections or when two of them coincide , visiting a common friend , which leads to triadic closure .",
    "these two processes do not depend on the distances between the users .",
    "a thorough description can be obtained with a mean - field approach ( see section  [ sec : mf ] ) .",
    "the results of the l model are shown in figure  2 .",
    "due to the triangle closing mechanism , this null model creates networks with a considerable level of clustering .",
    "however , it does not reproduce the distance dependencies of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the error @xmath12 of the l model is also around twice higher than the error of the tf model ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "the geography and the structure are coupled in the tf model through the random mobility .",
    "changes in the underlying mobility mechanism affect the quality of the results .",
    "the lowest @xmath12 values are obtained with the power - law distribution in the jump lengths , while normal or uniformly distributed jumps yield worse results ( e.g. , for the us the tf model has @xmath12 lower by @xmath22 and @xmath23 than the tf - normal and the tf - uniform models , respectively , as shown in figure  6 ) .",
    "simplified models that neglect either geography or network structure perform considerably worse than the tf model in reproducing the properties of real networks .",
    "likewise , non - realistic assumptions on human mobility mechanism yield worse results than the default tf model .",
    "to conclude , the coupling of geography and structure through a realistic mobility mechanism produces networks with significantly more realistic geographic and structural properties .     for the tf model , the two null models : spatial ( s model ) or linking ( l model ) , and the tf model with normally or uniformly distributed travel distances.,width=313 ]              the results presented",
    "so far have been obtained at the optimal values of @xmath16 and @xmath24 .",
    "the question remains , however , of how robust these results are to changes in the values of the parameters . in figure  7 , we report the effect of varying @xmath16 while @xmath24 is maintained constant in its optimal value .",
    "the linking probability @xmath4 loses its power - law shape for very low values of @xmath16 , marking the limit in which random mobility is the main mechanism for the agents traveling in detriment of friend visits . in this case ,",
    "most of the links are created due to encounters occurring in nearby locations or are random connections , and so the distribution of triangles disparity @xmath7 loses its bimodal shape .",
    "furthermore , the friend visits provide opportunities to reciprocate the connections .",
    "this is why for extremely low values of @xmath16 , the reciprocity @xmath5 is close to zero . towards the other limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 the social overlap @xmath20 and the triangle - closing probability @xmath9 steadily increase . in this limit , the linking probability @xmath4 , the reciprocity @xmath5 and the distribution of triangles disparity @xmath7 recuperate their shapes of the optimum .    figure  8 explores the impact of varying @xmath24 while @xmath16 is fixed to its optimal value .",
    "the effect of @xmath24 on @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the opposite to that of @xmath16 : these metrics decrease at all distances with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for this is that visits to friends are the main forces behind the creation of new triads and the subsequent closure of triangles .",
    "note that the more connections are created randomly ( higher @xmath24 ) , the less links will be a result of friend visits .",
    "we will expose and describe in detail the interplay between these two mechanisms in the mean - field calculations .    a possible variation of the tf model consists of eliminating friend visits or random connections ( _ i.e. _ , setting @xmath16 or @xmath24 to @xmath26 ) .",
    "this prevents the model from producing networks with characteristics comparable to the real ones in all the cases , leading to increase in @xmath12 of around @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , the model results are quite robust to variations in the update rules , the random connection mechanism , the connecting rules in each agent neighborhood and the variants in the way users visit friends .",
    "these variations lead to changes in @xmath12 smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the results with different model variants is included in appendix b.      in this section , we consider the l model , introduced in section  [ sec : insights ] , to gain some analytical insights on the mechanisms ruling the final network structure .",
    "although this model is a simplified version of the tf model , the results of the simulations yield a relatively low value of @xmath12 ( figures  6 , and supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and [ supfig_10 ] of appendix b ) .",
    "we write the equations for the time evolution of the properties of the network and solve them numerically . among all the properties , we focus on the average clustering coefficient @xmath28 , the overall reciprocity @xmath29 and the degree distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the clustering coefficient is defined as a ratio of all the closed triads to all triads existing in the network , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 .",
    "the number of triads @xmath31 can be calculated knowing the degree distribution .",
    "the number of closed triads @xmath32 in the l model grows with time mostly due to the friend visits mechanism .",
    "a triangle is formed every time two friends of the same hosting agent meet in the host s place and decide to connect .",
    "note that an undirected triangle corresponds to @xmath33 undirected closed triads .",
    "assuming that the contribution of random links is negligible , the evolution of the number of closed triads is described by @xmath34 where @xmath35 , meaning that we do not distinguish between in - degree and out - degree ; @xmath36 represents the number of nodes with the degree higher than @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of potential hosts , @xmath37 is an estimate of the lower bound for the number of triangles closed by one closing link @xmath38 .",
    "finally , @xmath39 is the expected number of encounters per host , which can be calculated as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of nodes with a given degree @xmath42 in the network .",
    "finally , note that the above definition of degree and the one obtained from symmetrizing directed networks ( used in previous sections ) are related by a proportionality factor @xmath43 .",
    "the reciprocity of connections @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of reciprocated links , @xmath46 is the number of non - reciprocated links and the total number of links @xmath47 .",
    "the numbers of links evolve as @xmath48 where @xmath49 corresponds to the probability that an agent visiting a neighbor gets her connection reciprocated ( their connection is initially single directional ) .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath32 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are mutually dependent .",
    "to calculate the degree distribution @xmath8 , we estimate the probability @xmath50 of a node to increase its degree by one unit in the current time step due to multiple encounters with friends of her friends @xmath51 where @xmath52 . in the l model , however , every node can increase its degree by multiple links in each time step . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect higher order terms induced by the possibility of creating multiple links .",
    "moreover , we note that equation  ( [ pk ] ) is a good estimate if there is not a strong correlation between node degrees .",
    "the number of nodes of certain degree @xmath42 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an estimate of the probability that the node degree increases , @xmath55 is the number of nodes with 0 out - degree and non - zero in - degree .",
    "such nodes are important because their connection can be easily reciprocated as a result of a friend visit .",
    "however , these nodes are not counted directly into @xmath56 , and so a correction is needed to account for them explicitly , as in equation  ( [ eq_degdistr3 ] ) .",
    "the number of such nodes can be calculated as @xmath57    the numerical solution of this set of equations describing the evolution of the l model is shown in figure  9 .",
    "the equations accurately predict the dynamics of the clustering coefficient @xmath28 , the reciprocity @xmath29 and the degree distribution @xmath11 for certain values of the parameters ( _ i.e. _ , for medium and high values of @xmath24 , as in the lower plots of figure  9 ) .",
    "the approximation yields slightly worse results when the number of random connections is small in comparison with the number of connections created due to friend visits ( _ i.e. _ , for low values of @xmath24 , as in the upper plots of figure  9b ) . in the latter case ,",
    "neither the degree distribution is well approximated , probably due to the degree - degree correlations introduced through the friend visit mechanism .",
    "the mean - field analysis of the l model shows that the friend visiting mechanism is a direct cause of triangle closure and link reciprocity .",
    "equation  [ eq_triangles ] , which estimates the growth of the number of triangles in the network , accounts only for the friend visiting mechanism ; yet it approximates closely the value of the clustering coefficient , also when @xmath24 , which controls the mechanism of random connections , is high .",
    "similarly , equation  [ eq_links_p ] , which estimates the growth of the number of reciprocated connections , accounts for the friend visiting mechanism and approximates well the value of reciprocity .",
    "we introduce a model that couples human mobility and link creation in social networks .",
    "the aim is to characterize the relation between network topology and geography observed in empirical online networks .",
    "the model has two free parameters @xmath24 and @xmath16 but , despite its simplicity , it is able to reproduce a good number of geo - social features observed in real data at a country level . comparing the tf model with simplified null models , we find that the coupling of geography and structure through a realistic mobility mechanism produces significantly more realistic social networks than the uncoupled models .",
    "social links in our model are formed mostly with relational ( due to triadic closure ) , and proximity ( through spatio - temporal coincidences ) mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "visiting friends helps to reinforce the existing relations and favors the closure of triads with particular properties regarding the distance balance of their edges .",
    "random link creation accounts for online acquaintances or for historical face - to - face encounters as individuals move their residence from one city to another .",
    "finally , individual random mobility allows the agents to explore new locations .",
    "an agent jumps to a new location , as opposed to slower growth reported in @xcite .",
    "we leave the exploration of temporal aspects of our model for the future research . ]",
    "our results show that by establishing an appropriate balance between friend visits and random link creation , the model can reproduce the main features of online social networks , e.g. , we show that @xmath58 of the mobility has to be directed towards existing friends .",
    "we demonstrate that these are the fundamental mechanisms at play in the model .",
    "the tf model is generic and functional for different datasets .",
    "human mobility driven by social ties has impact on the modeling of disease spreading , and may improve its predictions .",
    "this model can also be used in simulations of processes that involve social networks and geography , e.g. , simulations of opinion formation , language evolution , or responses of a population to extreme events . moreover",
    ", it can also be helpful to design network benchmarks with realistic geo - social properties to test , for instance , the scalability of technical solutions in social online networks related to geography of its physical infrastructure .",
    "the data analyzed are publicly available as they come from public online social sites or data repositories ( twitter , gowalla and brightkite ) .",
    "since our analysis relies on statistical features and not on single cases , any private information about users had been removed and the analysis was performed on anonymized datasets .",
    "we would like to warmly thank luis f. lafuerza for helpful discussions on the analytical treatment of the model .",
    "in this appendix , we present supplementary figures that reproduce the figures of the main text for the united kingdom and germany .",
    "in this appendix , we consider several variants of the tf model and the l model and evaluate their results .",
    "we describe a total of @xmath59 variants marked with different colors in the tables in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] . for each variant",
    "we explore the space of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath24 .",
    "we run the models for @xmath16 from the set @xmath60 and @xmath24 from @xmath61 , yielding in total @xmath62 parameter combinations . for each of the model variants , we find the parameters that minimize the fitting error @xmath12 .",
    "we plot its value in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we describe in detail each of the variants and its results .",
    "first , we modify the jump size distribution to understand its impact on the geo - social properties .",
    "we consider the following cases : the default power - law jumps with exponent @xmath63 , a minimal jump length of @xmath64 km and a cutoff at @xmath65 km , as in  @xcite ( the tf model ) , uniformly distributed random jumps up to @xmath65 km ( tf - uniform ) , normally distributed jumps with standard deviation of @xmath64 km ( tf - normal ) , and no jumps to new locations at all ( the l model ) .",
    "we plot the minimal fitting error of these cases in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] using different colors of the curves .",
    "the default power - law jumps show the best results with the lowest error for most of the variants .",
    "the normal distribution and the l model tend to perform considerably worse .",
    "the highly unrealistic uniform jumps understandingly provide the worst results and the highest error values for almost all variants .    to assess the role of friend visits and random connections we turn on and off these two components by setting to zero the corresponding parameters @xmath16 and @xmath24 .",
    "we plot the results in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] with dashed and dotted lines .",
    "we observe significantly higher error values whenever one of these two components is turned off , for most of the model s variants , what demonstrates their importance for the tf model .    to prevent users from spreading into inhabited regions , we include in the tf model an angular preference for the jumps .",
    "namely , the direction of each jump is chosen randomly with a probability proportional to the number of inhabitants present at the destination .",
    "note that this does not affect in any way the length of the jumps , which is drawn independently beforehand . to estimate the population of the target area",
    ", we use the gridded population of the world @xcite . to test how this angular preference impacts the results , we consider a variation of the models without it and compare the results .",
    "the two variants are included in the lowest row of the table in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] .",
    "they show almost no difference in the error values for the germany , although a systematic difference exists for the uk ; the error of the variant with direction preference is consistently lower in the case of that country .",
    "the presence of the sea around the uk introduces a distorting factor for the tf model . without the directional preference the agents freely spread over the sea independently on the geographical shape of the country , leading to unrealistic results .",
    "agents traveling and link creation can be realized in the simulation in various update orders . by default , at each time step , each agent first moves , next connects to other random agents , and then connects locally ; the following agent performs the same actions in the same order , etc .",
    "we call this method sequential ( `` seq '' ) . in an alternative update rule , which we call simultaneous ( `` sim '' ) ,",
    "first all the agents move , then all of them create random connections , and finally all of them create connections locally .",
    "the two update rules are included in the second row , counting from the bottom , of the table in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] .",
    "the update rules have little impact on the final networks resulting from the simulation .    in the tf and l models ,",
    "the agents create with probability @xmath24 random connections .",
    "these links can be created in different ways ; we consider three variants .",
    "first , each agent chooses another agent uniformly at random , what constitutes the default mechanism ( `` rnd '' ) .",
    "second , each agent randomly picks another node with probability proportional to the current degree of the node , which corresponds to the preferential attachment mechanism ( `` pa '' ) .",
    "third , the agent draws another node with probability decaying as a power - law of the distance between the two agents ( `` dist '' ) , with its exponent equal to @xmath66 and the minimal distance of @xmath67 km .",
    "the type of random connecting mechanism used is listed in the third row , counting from the bottom , of the table in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] . in some cases ,",
    "e.g. , for germany , the distant - dependent probability of creating a random link provides better results than the other variants .",
    "we consider similar variants for the connections formed inside spatial boxes , which are created with the probability @xmath68 .",
    "the agents can connect uniformly at random ( `` rnd '' ) , with a preference for high - degree nodes ( `` pa '' ) , or a preference toward the nodes with high intrinsic fitness ( `` fitn '' ) .",
    "the fitness of the nodes is drawn from a power - law distribution with an exponent of @xmath23 , which roughly corresponds to the distribution of the growth rates reported in @xcite .",
    "these variants are implemented in the following way .",
    "first , we note that the number of connections created by the agent is a result of a binomial process with probability @xmath68 and the number of trials is equal to the number of agents that currently stay in the given spatial box .",
    "the expected number of links created in such binomial process is known , therefore , an equivalent number of connections can be created with one of the two mentioned preferential processes .",
    "the type of connecting mechanism applied in the spatial boxes is listed in the top row of the table in supplementary figures  [ supfig_9 ] and  [ supfig_10 ] .",
    "there is no consistent difference in the error values between these variants .",
    "thus , the connecting mechanism applied in the spatial boxes has little impact on the results .",
    "we conclude that the main components of the tf models are crucial to reproduce the structure and geography of the social networks .",
    "these components include the mobility model , friend visits and random connections .",
    "the power - law mobility model tends to produce the best results .",
    "the angular preference of travels is important for countries whose geography is strongly restrained , e.g. , by sea . other modifications to the model",
    "have low or no consistent impact on the results , with the exception of the distance dependent random connections , which in certain cases consistently influence the results .",

    "<S> our model reproduces various topological and physical properties of the networks not captured by models uncoupling mobility and social interactions such as : i ) the total size of the connected components , ii ) the distance distribution between connected users , iii ) the dependence of the reciprocity on the distance , iv ) the variation of the social overlap and the clustering with the distance . besides numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , a mean - field approach is also used to study analytically the main statistical features of the networks generated by a simplified version of our model . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the results to changes in the model parameters is explored , finding that a balance between friend visits and long - range random connections is essential to reproduce the geographical features of the empirical networks . </S>"
