    "first , the present experiments have been realized with a mean flow parallel to the channels created by the relative shift of the wall surfaces",
    ". it will be important to compare these results with the case of flow perpendicular to these channels : velocity fluctuations in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the flow should then be significantly different from those in the present experiments .",
    "[ eq1 ] should , for instance , be modified .",
    "also , the present experiments deal with relatively short path lengths such that transverse exchange between channels may be considered as negligible : the results obtained may therefore be different for longer path lengths .",
    "it is also possible that the spatial correlation of the velocity field will eventually decay at very long distances although this has not been observed in our experimental model .",

    "<S> the aperture field is shown to display long range correlations perpendicular to @xmath0 : for flow in that direction , the width and geometry of the front of a dyed shear - thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent one have been studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate . </S>",
    "<S> the front width increases linearly with distance indicating a convection of the fluids with a low transverse mixing between the flow paths . </S>",
    "<S> the width also increases with the flow - rate as the fluid rheology shifts from newtonian at low shear rates @xmath1 towards a shear thinning behaviour at higher @xmath1 values . </S>",
    "<S> the width also increases with the polymer concentration at high flow - rates . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the enhancement of the flow velocity contrasts between different flow channels for shear thinning fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the relative widths at low and high @xmath1 values for different polymer concentrations are well predicted by an analytical model considering the fracture as a set of parallel ducts of constant hydraulic apertures . </S>",
    "<S> the overall geometry of the experimental front geometry is also predicted by the theoretical model from the aperture map . </S>"
