    "quantum systems that exchange energy with an environment have attracted a great deal of attention for many years @xcite .",
    "the interest in these dissipative ( open ) quantum systems ranges from quantum computing and quantum information theory to biological physics  @xcite .",
    "recent developments in the transport properties of nanoscale systems @xcite raise new interest in these topics .",
    "for instance , the dissipative effects of the surrounding environment are key to understand the non - equilibrium properties of nanostructures and their approach to steady state  @xcite .",
    "however , the study of dissipative many - body quantum systems represents a major computational challenge .",
    "there are essentially two ways to approach this problem .",
    "one consists in deriving equations of motion ( master equations ) for the reduced density matrix ( dm ) of the system of interest by integrating out the degrees of freedom of the bath .",
    "@xcite the further assumption of markovian dynamics leads to different kinds of master equations for the dm  @xcite , perhaps the most popular being the lindblad equation  @xcite which is often used in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to use stochastic schrdinger equations  @xcite which are the stochastic unraveling of the master equations .",
    "if the hamiltonian of the system does not depend on microscopic degrees of freedom , like the density or current density , both approaches describe the same physical properties .",
    "@xcite    irrespective of the chosen method , the solution of these equations is a formidable task which scales exponentially with the number of electrons .",
    "this is true even for a system of non - interacting electrons since the correlations induced by the bath make it impossible to exactly reduce the @xmath0-particle equation of motion into @xmath0 distinct single - particle equations of motion .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to discuss an _",
    "ansatz _ which greatly simplifies this task for the dynamics of @xmath0 non - interacting electrons in interaction with a bath .",
    "we focus on the dm approach but the conclusions are exactly the same for the stochastic schrdinger equations . the latter , in fact , have found application in the recently developed stochastic time - dependent current - density functional theory ( s - tdcdft )  @xcite , an extension of time - dependent current - density functional theory to systems in dynamical interaction with an environment . in s",
    "- tdcdft the many - body interacting problem in the presence of the environment is mapped into an effective single - particle non - interacting problem in the presence of the same environment .",
    "the _ ansatz _",
    "we discuss in this work is thus of great use in the numerical solution of the equations of motion of s - tdcdft ,  @xcite and may therefore find application in disparate problems beyond the examples presented in this paper , where interactions are important .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ scheme ] we describe in detail our proposed scheme .",
    "we define the master equation framework and our _ ansatz _ , along with the detailed structure of the resulting equations . in secs .",
    "[ numeric ] and [ numeric1 ] we give numerical examples of our scheme .",
    "we calculate currents induced by optical excitation in quantum ring structures in the presence of dissipation at @xmath1 ( sec .",
    "[ numeric ] ) and consider steady state properties of a quantum system at finite temperatures ( sec .  [ numeric1 ] ) .",
    "we study systems which are small enough so that we can compare the results from our scheme with the full many - body calculation .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the two methods for a large range of parameters . in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] we derive an analytical justification for our scheme .",
    "starting from the exact many - body master equations we average over the many - body degrees of freedom and study the resulting ( non - linear ) equations .",
    "[ summary ] is devoted to a summary and outlook .",
    "our goal is to study the dynamics of @xmath0 electrons described by a non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath2 , while taking into account dissipation processes . to be more specific let us employ the following lindblad - type master equation for the many - electron dm @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) @xcite _ m = -i[,_m]+_m  , [ lind_eq1 ] where @xmath5 $ ] denotes the commutator , and @xmath6 is the lindbladian superoperator , defined via a set @xmath7 of so - called `` lindblad operators '' by _",
    "m = _ n , n ( -\\ { v^_nn v_nn , _ m } + v_nn _ m v^_nn )  , [ lindbladian ] with @xmath8 the anti - commutator .",
    "the sums over @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are performed over all many - particle levels of the system and the @xmath12-operators are conveniently selected in the form @xmath13 , describing a transition from the many - body state @xmath14 into the state @xmath15 with the transition rate @xmath16 .",
    "although @xmath16 are introduced phenomenologically here , these coefficients can be in principle derived from a microscopic theory .",
    "a common form for @xmath16 is described as follows @xcite . at @xmath1",
    ", dissipation drives the system towards its ground state , which we denote by the index @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to select @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , by assuming that the transition rate into the ground state is independent of @xmath10 , we may write @xmath20 .",
    "this choice for the relaxation rates is a @xmath1 manifestation of detailed balance @xcite , which we assume to hold for a markovian ohmic bath in the long - time limit .",
    "in fact , there are other ways to choose the relaxation operators and still ensure detailed balance , and we have checked different options in our numerical calculations ( sec .",
    "[ numeric ] ) and found no qualitative change in our results .",
    "therefore , we shall keep the above normalization hereon .    for a system with @xmath21 single - electron energy levels and @xmath0 electrons , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ lind_eq1 ] ) generally requires the solution of @xmath22 coupled differential equations , where @xmath23 and we have taken into account constrains of hermiticity and the unit trace of the density matrix . for the general case ( excluding ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , the problem thus scales exponentially with the number of particles @xcite .",
    "consider now an operator @xmath26 , a sum over single - particle operators .",
    "( this is not the most general form of operator but it encompasses most of the observables of physical interest , like , e.g. , the density or current density . )",
    "we make the following conjecture : the expectation value of @xmath27 over a many - particle non - interacting electron state with dissipation can be approximated as a sum of single - electron expectation values of @xmath28 over an ensemble of @xmath0 single - electron systems with _ specifically selected _ single - electron dissipation operators , i.e. @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is a single - electron dm ( effectively describing the @xmath31-th electron ) , each obeying its own lindblad master equation ^(j ) = -i[h_j,^(j)]+^(j ) ^(j )  .",
    "[ lind_eq2 ] the choice of superoperators @xmath32 is dictated by two requirements : ( i ) for a time - independent hamiltonian the dissipation processes should result in the fermi - dirac distribution at long times , and ( ii ) the relaxation rate of many - electron states is @xmath33 .    as we will demonstrate ( numerically in sec .",
    "[ numeric ] as well as analytically in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] ) , these two requirements are met if one chooses a simple form for the @xmath12-operators , which reflects the physical process at which the different electrons decay to consecutive single - particle levels ( i.e. , the @xmath34th electron will decay to the @xmath35-th single - particle level , see eq .",
    "( [ v_effective ] ) ) .",
    "once a form for @xmath32 is chosen , one only needs to solve @xmath36 equations , a reduction which enormously speeds up numerical calculations .",

    "( [ lindbladian ] ) , with single - electron @xmath12 operators of the following form : for the @xmath31-th electron we select at @xmath1 v^j_kk=\\ {    cl | j k | & ,  k k= j ;   k k_f + 0 & ,     . , [ v_effective ] where @xmath37 are now the single - particle states and @xmath38 is the index of the fermi level . in some sense ,",
    "such a replacement of the many - body equation of motion by a set of auxiliary single - electron equations is similar to the introduction of a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons in density - functional theory .",
