    "kaon - nucleus bound systems , such as kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei , have been studies to obtain information on the kaon properties in the nuclear medium or kaon - nucleon interactions at finite density .",
    "this information is important as a basic piece of strangeness in nuclei .",
    "it is also important , for example , for heavy ion physics and astro - nuclear physics to determine the constraints on kaon condensation in high - density matter .",
    "the @xmath3-nucleus interaction has been studied so far based on the experimental data of lightly bound kaonic atoms obtained by the x - ray spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "it is known that interesting features of kaon - nucleus bound systems are tied to the properties of kaons in nuclei which are strongly influenced by the change undergone by the @xmath17 in the nuclear medium , because the @xmath17 is a resonance state just below the kaon - nucleon threshold .",
    "in fact , there are studies of kaonic atoms carried out by modifying the properties of the @xmath17 in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "these works reproduce the properties of specific kaonic atoms reasonably well .",
    "the theoretical studies on kaon - nucleus optical potential based on the chiral unitary model were also reported  @xcite , and our understanding of the properties of @xmath17 has been developed @xcite , recently .",
    "it is expected that , in near future , one completes the study on the kaon properties for lightly bound kaonic atoms accessible by the kaonic x - ray technique .",
    "the frontier of this subject is in higher density region which will be studied by deeply bound kaonic atoms  @xcite and kaonic nuclei .    in recent years",
    ", there have been many researches in the studies of kaonic nuclear states , which are kaon - nucleus bound systems by the strong interaction inside the nucleus . from the theoretical study of the structure of the kaonic nuclear states using @xmath5-nucleus optical potentials obtained in the phenomenological approach  @xcite and the chiral unitary model  @xcite , it has turned out that kaonic nuclear states have large decay widths of the order of several tens of mev . the kaonic nuclear states for lighter nuclei  @xcite and baryon resonances with two kaons  @xcite were also studied theoretically .",
    "common achievement of the theoretical study on the @xmath18 system  @xcite is that the @xmath18 system forms a bound state with a rather large width .",
    "but the binding energy and width do not reach agreement within the theoretical calculations yet . in the experimental side ,",
    "an indication of the @xmath19 bound state was observed by the finuda experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the critical analyses of the latest data were reported by oset , toki and their collaborators  @xcite , who claimed that the origins of the structure seen in the experimental spectra  @xcite can be explained by the well - known processes .",
    "the detailed analysis was also performed to understand fully the finuda data  @xcite .",
    "thus , the studies of the kaonic nuclear structure still have some sources of controversy and we need further studies .    as for the formation and observation of the kaonic nuclear states by direct reactions , in - flight ( @xmath20 ) reactions were proposed and performed by kishimoto and his collaborators",
    "the theoretical calculations of the energy spectra of the in - flight ( @xmath20 ) reaction were performed in the effective number approach  @xcite and in the green s function method  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same theoretical technique as ref .",
    "@xcite was used , which was successfully applied for the deeply bound pionic atom formation reactions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , clear peak structure indicating the kaonic bound states has not been found in the formation spectra and it has turned out that it is difficult to observe clear signals for kaonic nuclear states solely with missing - mass spectroscopy due to the large @xmath21 absorption width .",
    "the theoretical prediction that there are no clear peaks for the @xmath22-@xmath4b bound system in the formation spectra is consistent with the data in ref .",
    "@xcite , which observed missing mass spectra of the @xmath23 reactions with 1 gev / c kaon .",
    "based on the data of this experiment , ref .",
    "@xcite extracted the potential depth of the kaon in nuclei by fitting the formation spectra in the green s function method with simple background estimation and found that the depth was as deep as @xmath24 to @xmath25 mev .",
    "as a new experiment , the @xmath12he(@xmath13 ) reaction for the formation of the @xmath19 system is proposed  @xcite in the new facility j - parc .",
    "we may be able to have new experimental information in the coming experiments in near future which will make us possible to reach the final conclusion for the properties and/or existence of the controversial kaonic nuclear states .",
    "as described above , there are several controversies about properties of the light kaonic nuclei . in this exploratory level ,",
    "the purpose of this article is to show the formation spectra of various light kaonic nuclei which are accessible by the ( @xmath20 ) reactions , namely @xmath19 , @xmath26 , @xmath2 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath3-@xmath4b systems , in order to compare formation spectra observed in forthcoming experiments . for this purpose",
    ", we study semi - exclusive ( @xmath0 ) spectra observed in coincidence detection of the final nucleon with the particles emitted by @xmath5 absorption into nuclei .",
    "this is one of the main novelties of this work .    to calculate the semi - exclusive ( @xmath0 ) spectra",
    ", we exploit the green s function method with a simple @xmath21 optical potential obtained by a low - density @xmath6 approximation .",
    "the optical potential is given by the @xmath29 scattering amplitude @xmath7 and the nuclear density distribution @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath29 scattering amplitude is evaluated in coupled channels of @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 based on the chiral unitary approach and the @xmath17 is dynamically generated .",
    "this potential automatically includes one - body @xmath21 absorption to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 channels .",
    "thus we can calculate the semi - exclusive processes of the kaonic nuclei decays including @xmath36 and @xmath32 .",
    "we assume a simple two parameter fermi function for the nuclear density @xmath30 , which should be calculated dynamically by few - body treatments though . as we will see later , even with such a simple estimation of the optical potential , the obtained potential produces a similar bound state structure with one calculated by an elaborated few - body formulation .",
    "thus , we expect to obtain very similar formation spectra with the few - body formulation .    in the present article",

    "have large decay widths , and thus the pole position in the complex plane is far from the real axis .",
    "we also notice that since we have assumed the @xmath43 profile in this article , we should consider the results listed in table  [ tab : eigen ] as qualitative . these binding energies and widths could be interesting to interpret the formation spectra calculated with the same density distributions and interactions . even in our simple framework , the calculated results shown in table  [ tab : eigen ]",
    "resemble to the results of the bound states obtained in three - body calculations with a variational approach  @xcite , in which they use a @xmath29 effective interaction derived by the chiral unitary approach  @xcite .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the in - flight ( @xmath0 ) reactions for the formation of light kaonic nuclear systems to get deeper physical insights on the spectra , and to investigate the formation spectra of the reaction which will be observed at new facilities like j - parc . </S>",
    "<S> we show the expected spectra for the formation of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-@xmath4b systems which are accessible by the ( @xmath0 ) experiments . by considering the conversion part of the green s function , </S>",
    "<S> we show the missing mass spectra of the ( @xmath0 ) reactions in coincident with the particle emissions due to @xmath5 absorption . to calculate the cross sections </S>",
    "<S> , we use the so - called @xmath6 approximation to evaluate the optical potential . as for the amplitude @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the chiral unitary amplitude of @xmath8 channel in vacuum for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the @xmath9-wave optical potential of @xmath10(1385 ) channel and the contributions from @xmath11 mixing in @xmath12he(@xmath13 ) reaction are also evaluated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the behavior of the poles of kaon green s function in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that @xmath12he(@xmath13 ) and @xmath12he(@xmath14 ) reaction spectra in coincident with the @xmath15 emission may show the structure in the kaon bound region indicating the existence of the unstable kaonic nuclear states . as for the @xmath16c(@xmath14 ) spectra with the @xmath15 emission , we may also observe the structure in the bound region , however , we need to evaluate the medium effects carefully for larger nuclei . </S>"
