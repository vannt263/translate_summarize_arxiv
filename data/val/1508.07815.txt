    "for these and all following all - sky maps , the data of which is available via the ibex data release website http://ibex.swri.edu/researchers/publicdata.shtml , an aitoff - projection was used such that the heliospheric nose direction is in the center of the map ( see appendix b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +",
    "for the visualisation of the resulting band of higher ena fluxes in the all - sky maps we use an aitoff projection ( see appendix b ) for all following figures . as a first step we check on the principal location and width of the ribbon originating from an h - wave , i.e.  we choose its thickness @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 denoting the shortest heliocentric distances of its sunward and anti - sunward side , respectively ) and its orientation given by the normal vector @xmath35 .",
    "the top panel of the fig .  4 gives the result of an infinitely thin h - wave ( i.e.  with vanishing thickness @xmath44 ) oriented perpendicularly to the vector @xmath45 , which is corresponding to the unit vector @xmath46 and which is anti - parallel to the most likely direction of the undisturbed local interstellar magnetic field ( see the discussion in section  5 below ) .",
    "its shortest heliocentric distance is @xmath39 .",
    "note that although the h - wave is infinitely thin , the corresponding ribbon is not : in an all - sky map it has a finite angular width because the angles @xmath40 , and @xmath31 are different , as is evident from the sketch in fig .",
    "the middle panel shows the result for an h - wave with the same orientation but a finite width ( as sketched in fig .",

    "the inner ( upper in the all - sky map ) angular ribbon boundary is determined by the angle @xmath19 resulting from the intersection of the anti - sunward plane with the ts , and the outer ( lower ) boundary by the angles @xmath48 resulting from the intersection of the sunward plane with the hp , as described in section  3 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the effect of different transformations of the hp on the lower ribbon boundary .",
    "first , a transformation to a polynomial shape is achieved by a taylor expansion of the hp function defined with eq.(5 ) , for details see appendix c. comparing the green line ( resulting from eq.(5 ) ) and the black line ( taylor - expanded hp function ) reveals that the effect of a polynomial hp on the ribbon location and width is negligible .",
    "this can easily be understood as a consequence of the fact that , in the upwind heliosphere ( @xmath49 ) , even in lowest ( second ) order the taylor expansion is well approximating the hp defined with eq.(5 ) , see figure  7 in appendix  c. second , a tilt of the hp by 5 or 10 degrees , achieved by subsequent rotations about the @xmath50- and @xmath51-axis , results in the lower boundary indicated by the red and blue line , respectively .",
    "these tilt angles are motivated by the recent finding by @xcite that the heliotail direction is deviating at most by 10 degrees from the inflow direction of the lism . evidently , the effect is significant and one concludes ( i ) from a comparison of the red and the green line that a tilt of the hp improves the agreement between the modelled and the observed ribbon and ( ii ) from a comparison of the red and the blue line that the tilt must be expected to be less than 10 degree , consistent with the findings by @xcite .",
    "therefore , for all following computations , we used the hp function eq.(5 ) with an additional tilt by 5  degrees .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "4 make it evident that the h - wave hypothesis results in an ena ribbon at the correct location in the all - sky maps and that its width must be a few tens of au , as was already speculated in @xcite .",
    "the given geometrical h - wave parameters were iterated such that the resulting ribbon geometry is a simultaneous best fit to the high - energy ena maps at 1.11 , 1.74 , and 2.73  kev provided by the ibex - hi sensor . the result for these",
    "are shown in fig .  5 , which demonstrates that the h - wave induced ena ribbon geometry is generally consistent with the ibex measurements at all these energies .",
    "note that for the highest energy channel at 4.3  kev shown in the bottom panel the ribbon feature is clearly present and well - fitted at high northern latitudes ( top of the map ) , but that there are significant ena emissions outside the ribbon at lower latitudes .",
    "these additional signals at higher energies are also known from measurements with the inca instrument aboard cassini @xcite .",
    "an explanation of the associated ` broadening ' of the ribbon at higher energies probably requires invoking additional ena sources , like secondary enas as , e.g. , discussed in @xcite .",
    "s  sr  kev ) as observed by ibex - hi and the simulated best - fit ( see text ) ribbon geometry for the energies 1.11 kev , 1.74 kev , 2.73 kev , and 4.29 kev from top to bottom.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    the above findings corroborate the assumption that the enas forming the ribbon in the ibex - hi all - sky maps can indeed originate in the intersection region of an h - wave with the inner heliosheath . while this represents a rather different explanation from all other scenarios that have been suggested , so far , it does confirm the relation of the ribbon to the local interstellar magnetic field that is needed in most other scenarios , too .",
    "one must distinguish , however , in the present model between the field direction and the normal vector to the h - wave front : as discussed in @xcite it is , in principle , possible that the h - wave front is not perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the effect of a different orientation along with different widths of the neutral density enhancement is discussed in the next section .",
    "+    to illustrate the sensitivity of the result to the orientation of the h - wave front , i.e.  to check on the goodness of the best fit , the upper two panels of fig .",
    "6 give the ribbon geometry for a wave normal vector @xmath35 whose direction differs by 5 and 10 degree , respectively , from the best fit direction . while the first result ( upper left panel ) is still compatible with the observational data , the second ( upper right panel ) is clearly not .",
    "it interesting to note that the best fit normal vector and the upwind direction @xmath52 have an angle of @xmath53 , which is close to the @xmath54 between the upwind direction for the untilted hp and the interstellar magnetic field estimated by @xcite .",
    "the ecliptic longitude @xmath55 and latitude @xmath56 of the best fit normal vector are also slightly different than the values discussed in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "keeping in mind , however , the simplifying assumptions regarding the ts and hp surfaces made in our analytical approach , one can safely state that the normal vector is closely related to the direction of the undisturbed local interstellar magnetic field .    the two lower plots in fig .",
    "6 show the influence of the h - wave width and reveal that the region of increased neutral density as well as , in turn , of enhanced ena production and flux must indeed be assumed to be about 25 - 28  au wide , assuming a ts radius of 84 to 94  au @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have constructed an analytic model that reproduces the correct geometry of the ibex ribbon in the all - sky ena flux maps and , thereby , corroborates the hypothesis that a propagating localized density increase in the neutral interstellar gas , termed an h - wave , can be the cause of the ibex ribbon .",
    "the best fit of this geometry to ibex ena data depends particularly on the orientation and width of the h - wave whose transit through the heliosphere leads to an increased production of enas in the inner heliosheath . despite the simplifying assumptions regarding the termination shock and heliopause surfaces , the proposed scenario ,",
    "although rather different from all others that have been invoked to explain the ibex ribbon , makes it likely that the ribbon is closely related to the direction of the undisturbed local interstellar magnetic field .    in subsequent work we will extend the modelling to a computation of the actual fluxes of enas resulting from an h - wave intersecting the inner heliosheath , i.e.  we will evaluate the relevant line - of - sight - integrals ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from an inner boundary ( ib ) at the detector to an outer boundary ( ob ) sufficiently beyond the ena source region (",
    "i.e.  in the present case beyond the hp ) : @xmath57        ds \\label{ena - flux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the solar wind and pick - up ion proton velocity ( @xmath58 ) distribution function @xmath59 and number density @xmath60 , the charge exchange cross section @xmath61 and the relative speed @xmath62 between a proton and an interstellar neutral hydrogen atom .",
    "there are two key ingredients : first , the proton velocity distribution function whose evolution has to be computed from a transport model like in @xcite or @xcite , but here for the ihs .",
    "the structure of @xmath59 in the intersection region of the h - wave and the ihs determines the ` fine structure ' of the ena fluxes in the ribbon in the all - sky - maps at different energies .",
    "second , the ena flux is directly proportional to the number density @xmath63 of the hydrogen atoms and , thus , to the h - wave signature . from astronomical observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and corresponding simulations @xcite it is derived that @xmath63 can easily vary by a factor of two and more down to the few  au scale in the so - called warm neutral ( interstellar ) medium . since the latter reflects the properties of the neutral component in the lism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one can expect to see such variation as a local h - wave with a two- to threefold enhanced @xmath63 .",
    "this directly translates , via eq.([ena - flux ] ) , into a correspondingly increased ena flux , which in turn represents the general ribbon feature in the all - sky maps .",
