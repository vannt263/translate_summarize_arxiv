    "the ut_fit _ collaboration  @xcite aims to determine the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the apex of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) , and in general the elements of the ckm matrix  @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "nowadays the sm analysis includes many experimental and theoretical results , such as predictions for several flavour observables and measurements of hadronic parameters which can be compared with the lattice qcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ut analysis has been extended beyond the sm , allowing for a model - independent determination of @xmath6 and @xmath7  assuming negligible new physics ( np ) contributions to tree - level processes  and a simultaneous evaluation of the size of np contributions to @xmath0 amplitudes compatible with the flavour data  @xcite .",
    "recently , the np analysis has been expanded to include an effective field theory study of the allowed np contributions to @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "this allows one to put model - independent bounds on the np energy scale associated to flavour- and cp - violating phenomena  @xcite .",
    ".input parameters used in the sm ut fit .",
    "the first error corresponds to the width of a gaussian , while the second one , whenever present , is the half width of a uniform distribution .",
    "the two distributions are then convolved to obtain the final one .",
    "entries marked with @xmath8 are only indicative of the @xmath9 probability ranges , as the full experimental likelihood has actually been used to obtain the prior distributions for these parameters",
    ". entries without errors are considered as constants in the fit . [ cols= \"",
    "< , < \" , ]     the results of our analysis are summarized in table [ tab : results2 ] .",
    "we see that the phase @xmath10 deviates from zero at more than @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : np ] we present the two - dimensional @xmath9 and @xmath12 probability regions for the np parameters @xmath13 and @xmath10 , the corresponding regions for the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the one - dimensional distributions for np parameters .",
    "the solution around @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the second solution is much more distant from the sm and it requires a dominant np contribution ( @xmath19 ) and in this case the np phase is very well determined .    finally , we have tested the significance of the np signal against different modeling of the probability density function ( p.d.f . ) .",
    "we have explored two more methods with respect to the standard gaussian one used by the d collaboration in presenting the result : this is mainly to address the non - gaussian tails that the experimental likelihood is showing .",
    "firstly , we have used the @xmath20 c.l .",
    "range for @xmath21^\\circ$ ] given by d to estimate the standard deviation , obtaining @xmath22 as input for the gaussian analysis .",
    "this is conservative since the likelihood has a visibly larger half - width on the side opposite to the sm expectation ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "second , we have implemented the likelihood profiles for @xmath23 and @xmath24 given by d , discarding the correlations but restoring the strong phase ambiguity .",
    "the likelihood profiles include the second minimum corresponding to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which is disfavoured by the oscillating terms present in the tagged analysis and is discarded in the gaussian analysis .",
    "also this approach is conservative since each one - dimensional profile likelihood is minimized with respect to the other variables relevant for our analysis .",
    "it is remarkable that both methods give a deviation of @xmath10 from zero of @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude that the combined analysis gives a stable departure from the sm , although the precise number of standard deviations depends on the procedure followed to combine presently available data .",
