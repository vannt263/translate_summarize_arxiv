    "approximately 15% to 20% of quasars have uv broad absorption line ( bal ) outflows or winds , depending on the sample selection criteria @xcite .",
    "the wind is believed to be a general feature in quasars , but it is seen only in favorable configurations due to a limited solid angle @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the bal wind is very uncertain .",
    "knowing the orientation of the bal wind relative to the accretion disk normal and dusty torus normal ( within the  standard quasar model , \" see antonucci 1993 ) would advance our knowledge of the physics of the bal wind launching mechanism .",
    "gathering evidence of quasar orientation is difficult .",
    "most of our knowledge derives from studies of radio loud quasars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , radio jets in balqsos are suppressed and especially so on scales larger than a few kpc , a trend that strengthens with increasing balnicity index @xcite . motivated by the potential orientation information ,",
    "studies of the rare subclass of radio loud balqsos have been an active area of research .",
    "statistical studies have been aimed at exploring the evidence for evolutionary models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the balqso phenomenon is a transient stage or models based on a preferred line of sight to an ever - present bal wind .",
    "the orientation models include various wind geometries : equatorial , @xcite ; mid - latitude , @xcite , polar @xcite or polar winds coexisting with equatorial winds @xcite .",
    "the radio surveys of @xcite have drawn no clear conclusions .",
    "only recently has direct information on this geometric configuration become available from radio observations .",
    "if a source is highly variable , one might infer a brightness temperature , @xmath2 k , that requires a nearly pole - on orientation and relativistic motion for the jet in order to avoid the  inverse compton catastrophe \" @xcite .",
    "numerous balqsos in a pole - on orientation have now been found by this method @xcite .",
    "the extra constraint provided by the polar orientation makes these balqsos valuable laboratories for studying quasar geometry .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) on the sky plane and kinematics of the radio jet provide probes of both the enveloping bal wind and the geometry of the wind / accretion disk system .",
    "another constraint on the quasar geometry is provided by the optical continuum polarization pa .",
    "this relates directly to the geometry of the uv absorbing wind and , even more so , the scattering surface that is associated with the elevated polarization seen in some balqsos .",
    "thusly motivated , we have begun a program to study subparsec and parsec scale radio jets in combination with optical polarization pas in balqsos .",
    "the doppler enhancement associated with the polar orientation tends to make the jets in polar balqsos amongst the most luminous in a class of objects that have a strong propensity for weak jet emission . in order to pursue a study of polar balqso geometry , high resolution ( high frequency ) , vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) observations with high sensitivity ( because of the weak secondary components and jets )",
    "are required in order to see the jet direction near the accretion disk .",
    "mrk231 is the best choice .",
    "the proximity , @xmath3 , and the large flux density of @xmath4 mjy at 22  ghz are two factors that greatly enhance the spatial resolution achievable in observations .",
    "we have examined high frequency vlba ( very long baseline array ) radio observations of mrk231 and their geometric implications @xcite .",
    "it is essential to do the same for more balqsos in order to understand which geometric properties are endemic to the broad absorption phenomenon and which properties are unrelated idiosyncrasies of particular sources .",
    "this critical aspect challenges the limits of our observational tools since all other bona - fide balqsos are much fainter radio sources than mrk231 .",
    "the next best choice after mrk231 is firstj155633.8 + 351758 ( firstj1556 + 3517 , hereafter ) , the high optical polarization quasar at z=1.50 , dubbed the first discovered radio loud balqso @xcite .",
    "strangely , like mrk231 , this is a member of the rare class of balqsos known as felobalqsos due to absorption in low ionization species and strong fe ii emission .",
    "being the  first \" radio loud balqso discovered led to a flurry of deep optical observations @xcite .",
    "the polarization pa @xmath5 from deep keck spectroscopy and it has a flat 25 to 30 mjy spectrum from 1.4 to 5 ghz @xcite . firstj1556 + 3517 is viewed close to the polar axis ( @xmath6 ) based on high variability brightness temperatures @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we discuss our vlba observations ranging from 1.6 ghz to 15.3 ghz and the implications for the quasar geometry .",
    "section  3 is a consideration of the geometrical implications of the observations .",
    "the next section discusses the implicit geometry in a broader context that includes mrk231 . throughout this paper , we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath7=71 km / s / mpc , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a previous vlbi observation of firstj1556 + 3517 was unresolved with a flux density of 26  mjy with the evn at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "better resolution was needed to detect a jet , so we carried out observations at frequencies of 1.6 , 5.0 , 8.4 and 15.3  ghz with the vlba at epoch 2011.07 ( project code br156 )  see table  [ table : observations ] .",
    "a recording rate of 512  mbps ( the best available at the time ) was used in order to achieve the high sensitivity required to detect a weak jet .",
    "this provided 64 mhz of bandwidth in 2 polarizations with 2-bit nyquist rate sampling at each frequency .",
    "the resultant image sensitivities were 0.11 , 0.08 , 0.08 and 0.15 mjy / beam at 1.6 , 5.0 , 8.4 and 15.3  ghz respectively .",
    "the data were correlated on the vlba correlator in socorro , nm and calibration was carried out in the standard way using nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package via the parseltongue interface @xcite .",
    "firstj1556 + 3517 was phase referenced to the nearby calibrator j1602 + 3326 to provide phase calibration and some astrometric information .",
    "subsequent phase self - calibration of the target source was also possible at all frequencies .",
    "at 1.4 and 5 ghz , the source was unresolved with synthesized beam sizes of approximately @xmath10  mas and @xmath11  mas respectively .",
    "as with previous vla and evn observations , there is no evidence of jet re - orientation in these images in the form of resolved emission at a differing position angle from the vlbi secondary component .",
    "however , at 8.4 and 15.3  ghz , with synthesized beams of @xmath12 and @xmath13  mas respectively , we partially resolve a faint secondary component ( see figure  1 ) allowing us to determine the direction of the parsec - scale jet .",
    "we fitted a two gaussian component model to the 8.4 and 15.3  ghz data using the difmap software package @xcite , the results of which are given in table  [ table : observations ] .",
    "the positions of the 8.4 ghz and 15.3 ghz secondary components do not agree , likely a combination of inhomogeneous optical depth effects and a curving jet .",
    "the 15.3 ghz observation , sensitive to emission originating much deeper within the optically thick plasma , is more relevant for exploring nuclear geometry .",

    "these can be summarized as    1 .",
    "the accretion disk position is associated with the high frequency radio core ( right hand frame figure  1 ) .",
    "2 .   in @xcite ,",
    "the variability brightness temperature was calculated as @xmath20 , thereby restricting the jet axis to @xmath6 to the line of sight .",
    "3 .   the projection of the radio jet axis on the sky plane , computed from the coordinates of the peaks of gaussian components , is at pa @xmath0 ( right hand frame figure  1 ) .",
    "4 .   from 2 and 3 above , the accretion disk normal ( parallel to the pc radio jet ) is rotated relative to the z axis ( the line of sight which comes out of the page ) by @xmath21 about the vertical , y - axis ( all rotations are in a left handed sense ) and @xmath22 about the horizontal , x - axis ( which points to the right ) , see figure  2 .",
    "the direction of the jet in figure  2 represents the maximum angle from the line of sight .",
    "the uv polarization direction is @xmath23 redward of @xmath24   ( see figure  2 ) @xcite .",
    "6 .   the scattered photons are along the line of sight by definition ( the z - axis ) .",
    "since the line of sight is through the bal wind and the jet is aligned close to the line of sight , the bal wind is a polar outflow aligned close to the line of sight .    combining these constraints",
    ", we deduce the relative orientation of the scattering surface that produces the high polarization and the bal wind . since the emission lines are polarized identically to the continuum , @xcite pointed out that the scattering surface lies well outside the broad emission line region , @xmath25 pc from the source .",
    "this is a typical distance to the inner edge of the dusty torus @xcite .",
    "a scatterer containing some dust seems reasonable based on the reddened spectrum of the polarized emission @xcite .",
    "an asymmetric distribution of dusty scatterers has been routinely invoked to explain the similar polarization properties of another reddened balqso , mrk231 , which also has a polarization level that rises rapidly into the near uv @xcite .",
    "for example , within the context of the  standard model \" we may have a torus with a symmetry axis that is tilted relative to the jet axis by @xmath26 to @xmath27 by means of a rotation about a line that is parallel to the pa of the projection of the polarization on the sky plane , i.e. , a line at @xmath28 in the x - y plane ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "misaligned tori are not an expected feature of the standard model . however , direct evidence of misalignment of molecular gas on subparsec and parsec scales exists .",
    "there are 10 agn with water maser disks ( viewed edge on ) that have been observed which also have high resolution images of the radio jets @xcite .",
    "one of these agn ( ngc 1068 ) also has mid - ir interferometry on parsec scales that are typical for the dusty torus @xcite . even though the statistics are small , the data indicates a significant misalignment of the normal to the plane of molecular gas rotation and the subparsec or parsec scale jet of @xmath29 in 20% to 30% of agn .",
    "so the occurrence of a misaligned torus in some balqsos should not be unexpected .",
    "the angle of misalignment , although speculative , is motivated in the next section .",
    "firstj1556 + 3517 is a very high polarization balqso with 12% continuum polarization in the near uv @xcite .",
    "a misalignment of the dusty torus and the radio jet is expected in high polarization ( @xmath30 ) balqsos based on theoretical modeling of polarization in polar bal wind models @xcite .",
    "theoretically , large attenuation of the continuum is achieved in lobalqsos by the base of the bal wind ( electron scattering ) and dusty gas that is entrained in the wind on parsec scales .",
    "thus , there is a large contribution of scattered light to the net observed flux . since the bal wind is parallel to the jet and the line of sight , in order for high polarization to occur in polar balqsos",
    ", the symmetry of the system must be broken .",
    "this is either accomplished by anisotropic scatterers ( see kim and martin 1995 ) or , as considered more likely here , an asymmetric distribution of isotropic scatters @xcite . if the large polarization is from anisotropic scatterers then the polarization direction might be determined by dust grain alignment in a large scale wind or a large scale ordered magnetic field .",
    "although this alternative scattering scenario is not ruled out by observation , it is not pursued here .",
    "in order to see if this scenario of an asymmetric distribution of isotropic scatters is reasonable , it would be instructive to compare our findings to another similar object .",
    "mrk231 is also a felobalqso with high near uv continuum polarization , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the data for mrk231 is superior due to its proximity to earth . in @xcite , we considered two epochs of 43 , 22 and 15 ghz vlba observations of the resolved core of mrk231 and also the time variability of the historic light curve at 22 ghz .",
    "a resolved secondary exists just 0.8 pc from the core ( see figure  3 ) . repeating the evidence and logic that we used to determine a nuclear geometry for firstj1556 + 3517 in section  3 with the data gathered from observations of mrk231 we find :",
    "the accretion disk position is associated with the radio core at 43 ghz ( see figure  3 , left frame ) .",
    "2 .   the variability brightness temperature , @xmath32 , restricts the jet axis to @xmath33 to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "3 .   the projection of the radio jet axis on the sky plane is at pa @xmath34 ( see figure  3 , left frame ) .",
    "4 .   from items 2 and 3 above , the accretion disk normal ( parallel to the parsec radio jet ) is rotated relative to the z axis ( the line of sight which is out of the page ) by @xmath35 about the vertical , y - axis ( all rotations are in a right handed sense ) and @xmath36 about the horizontal , x - axis ( which points to the right ) .",
    "the angle of the jet in figure  3 represents the maximum angle from the line of sight .",
    "the polarization direction from hst and ground based observations in @xcite is @xmath37 redward of @xmath38 ( as depicted in the left hand frame of figure  3 ) .",
    ".   the scattered photons are along the line of sight by definition ( the z - axis ) .",
    "7 .   since the line of sight is through the bal wind and the jet",
    "is aligned close to the line of sight , the bal wind is a polar outflow aligned close to the line of sight .",
    "the right hand frame of figure  3 is a realization of the polarization and radio data in terms of the components of the standard model .",
    "a tilted dusty torus exists as for firstj1556 + 3517 .",
    "the polar bal wind directed close to the line of sight simplifies the scattering geometry .",
    "the scattering mirror is essentially the small unshadowed region of the surface that bounds the hole of the torus almost due south .",
    "the projection of the tangent plane at the  centroid \" of this effective mirror , as seen in the sky plane , is almost parallel to the pa of the continuum polarization ( reflected light is polarized perpendicular to the scattering plane )",
    ". it would be exactly parallel to the pa of the continuum polarization if the bal wind were viewed exactly pole - on .",
    "the angle of the tilt was found by rotating the angle of the torus until the desired level of polarization was obtained ( punsly et al . in preparation ) .",
    "this result is assumption dependent and to match the polarization and attenuation in the uv requires the entrainment of exotic dust in the bal wind , the type of non - galactic dust that is seen in some distant galaxies in the study of gravitational lenses and supernovae @xcite .",
    "the large attenuation in the uv requires small grain sizes @xcite , and we assume them to be isotropic scatterers .",
    "the dust entrained in the bal wind attenuates both the continuum and the light reflected from the torus , but does it not polarize the emission that it scatters similar to what is seen in the centers of cold dark clouds in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the large number of free parameters in the models detracts greatly from their predictive power .",
    "in this letter , we demonstrated how @xmath39 , the optical continuum pa and the radio jet direction can be used to determine a compatible geometry for individual balqsos within the context of the fundamental elements of the standard model .",
    "this was illustrated with two similar high polarization sources  firstj1556 + 3517 and mrk231 , indicating a misaligned accretion disk and dusty torus .",
    "higher frequency and higher sensitivity vlba observations of firstj1556 + 3517 ( using the new wideband digital backend system ) will allow us to better determine the direction of the jet on even smaller scales and better constrain the geometry ( recall the evidence for a curving jet discussed in section  3 ) .",
    "if higher resolution observations indicate a change to the estimate of the jet pa then the methods presented here are robust and the geometric picture in figure  2 ( the jet direction ) can be modified in a straightforward manner .",
    "furthermore , multi - epoch monitoring of superluminal motion of secondaries in firstj1556 + 3517 and mrk231 can supplement the @xmath39 estimates in our determination of the angle between the line of sight and the jet direction .",
