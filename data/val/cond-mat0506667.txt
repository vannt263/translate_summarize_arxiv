    "the quasi two dimensional spin-1/2 quantum magnet cs@xmath3cucl@xmath4 has attracted much theoretical and experimental interest in recent years as a possible realization of a two dimensional quantum spin liquid .",
    "@xcite this anisotropic triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet is believed to be a promising candidate due to its small spin , quasi two dimensionality and geometrically frustrated spin interactions .",
    "although cs@xmath3cucl@xmath4 exhibits conventional incommensurate long range magnetic order at low temperatures , neutron scattering measurements have revealed unusual features in the spin excitation spectrum . in particular , the dynamical correlations are found to be dominated by an extended scattering continuum over a relatively large window of energies .",
    "several workers have interpreted this observation as a signature of deconfined , fractionalized spin-1/2 ( spinon ) excitations , characteristic of a spin liquid phase . in this line of approach , the observed broad scattering continuum is interpreted in terms of a two - spinon scattering continuum .",
    "@xcite    however , a strong scattering continuum does not entail an underlying spin liquid phase .",
    "in fact , a conventional magnetically ordered phase with strong magnon interactions can exhibit a broad continuum due to multi magnon scattering processes .",
    "a previous examination of the inelastic neutron scattering data on cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 was performed in the framework of linear spin wave ( lsw ) theory .",
    "@xcite the latter predicts sharp single particle excitations and weak two magnon scattering continua , features which were argued to be in poor agreement with the data . given that the magnetic properties derive from small @xmath5 cu spins",
    ", one would _ a priori _ expect magnon interactions to play an important role . in order to assess the applicability of a spin wave based scenario to cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 it is therefore necessary to go beyond linear spin wave theory .    on a qualitative level the predictions of nonlinear spin wave theory",
    "are readily anticipated . by goldstone",
    "s theorem the breaking of a continuous symmetry in a magnetically ordered state enforces the presence of single particle excitations at low energies . as a result of the aforementioned interactions , these magnons acquire a finite life time , which in turn leads to a finite line width in the dynamical structure factor .",
    "furthermore , compared to linear spin wave theory , spectral weight is transferred to higher energies via multi magnon scattering processes . in the case of cs@xmath3cucl@xmath4 one may expect the presence of a strong scattering continuum in the ordered phase because ( 1 ) the low spin and the frustrated nature of the exchange interactions lead to a small ordered moment and strong quantum fluctuations around the ordered state ; ( 2 ) the magnon interactions in non - collinear spin structures like the ones found in cs@xmath3cucl@xmath4 induce a coupling between transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations .",
    "this interaction provides an additional mechanism for damping the spin waves and can enhance the strength of the scattering continuum .",
    "there is evidence of low - energy spin wave modes in the inelastic neutron scattering data .",
    "sharp peaks are also observed at high energies near special wave vectors where a putative spin wave dispersion is at a saddle - point .",
    "it is important to note that this spin wave dispersion is dramatically `` renormalized '' compared to the prediction of linear spin wave theory .",
    "@xcite    _ a priori _ it appears that nonlinear spin wave theory could have the necessary ingredients to account for the spin correlations observed in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 .",
    "the issue then is whether it is possible to achieve a _ quantitative _ description of the experiments in low orders of perturbation theory in the spin wave interactions .    in the present work we go beyond linear spin wave theory and include , within the framework of a @xmath2 expansion , the quantum fluctuations around the classical ground state .",
    "we then apply the results to the case @xmath5 , in which the formal expansion parameter becomes of order @xmath6 and is therefore not small .",
    "we are motivated by the observation that spin wave theory gives a good description of physical properties of the square - lattice spin-@xmath7 heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite indeed , higher order ( in a @xmath2 expansion ) corrections to linear spin wave theory were shown to be small in this case . furthermore , taking these corrections into account in the calculation of static and dynamical properties leads to an improved agreement with the results of more sophisticated numerical techniques . @xcite",
    "although a corresponding analysis is not available for the frustrated triangular antiferromagnet , perturbative expansions in @xmath2 have shown the renormalization due to quantum effects is relatively small .",

    "the total integrated intensity of each polarization is given by `` equal - time '' correlation functions , @xmath164 the one - magnon contribution to the integrated intensity of each polarization is then determined by integrating the respective correlation function in the vicinity of the single particle dispersions . in practice",

    "we see that the integrated spectral weight is concentrated in the vicinities of the ordering wave vector @xmath31 and @xmath166 and is largely suppressed near the @xmath30 point .",
    "the weights associated with single magnon excitations are strongly suppressed for the secondary modes .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - collinearity of the magnetic order .",
    "the in - plane modes are significantly damped as a result of the coupling between longitudinal and transverse fluctuations .",
    "such a coupling is not present for the out - of - plane mode and therefore the principal mode carries generally more spectral weight .",
    "nevertheless the fraction of spectral weight associated with single - particle excitations decreases significantly whenever the renormalized spin wave dispersion is pushed upwards in energy for a given momentum .",
    "for instance , near wave vector @xmath167 the principal spin wave mode lies within the two magnon continuum and as a result less than 50 % of the spectral weight is attributed to the one - magnon excitation .    the scattering intensity can also be studied by performing a wave vector average , @xmath168 by the frequency sum rule , the scattering intensity ( eq .

    "we find that the effects of the finite energy resolution of @xmath186  mev are generally outweighed by the effects of the finite momentum resolution .",

    "given that the spin waves are nearly dispersionless along the @xmath192 direction , we have only taken into account the spatial resolution along the chain direction .",
    "to illustrate this point , let us consider the results for scans b , e , g and h shown in fig .",
    "[ plotscan2 ] .",
    "the insets of panel ( 4 ) show the results of both linear spin wave theory and the @xmath2 expansion for a hypothetical energy resolution of @xmath193  mev which has been introduced to make the various delta function peaks visible ( the momentum resolution is set to zero @xmath194 ) .",
    "first we consider the results for scan h ( panel 4 of fig .",
    "[ plotscan2 ] ) .",
    "linear spin wave theory predicts peaks at approximately @xmath195  mev and @xmath196  mev corresponding to the degenerate spin wave modes @xmath197 and to @xmath198 respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 correction yields a slight upward shift in the energy of these peaks . in both linear spin - wave and @xmath2 calculations ,",
    "the two magnon scattering continuum is found to carry nearly a quarter of the integrated spectral weight .",
    "taking into account the finite momentum resolution ( the width at half maximum is @xmath199 ) we find that the sharp peaks get broadened very significantly as is shown in panel ( 4 ) .",
    "the dynamical structure factor now exhibits an extended continuum in which the single - particle excitation can no longer be resolved and merges smoothly with the two magnon continuum .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to the experimental observations shown for comparison in panel ( 2 ) of fig .",
    "[ expplotscan ] .",
    "next we turn to scan g ( panel 3 of fig .",
    "[ plotscan2 ] ) , which probes the vicinity of the wave vector @xmath200 .",
    "experimentally a resolution - limited peak is observed at an energy of @xmath201  mev in this region of intense scattering , see panel ( 1 ) of fig.[expplotscan ] .",
    "however , about two thirds of the spectral weight is associated with a scattering continuum at higher energies .",
    "both linear spin wave theory and the @xmath2 expansion predict sharp peaks in this region of the brillouin zone .",
    "the @xmath2 expansion gives a spin wave peak at @xmath202  mev carrying nearly half of the spectral weight and two further peaks at energies around @xmath203 mev corresponding to the two secondary spin wave modes .",
    "the two magnon scattering continuum extends up to @xmath204  mev and carries nearly a quarter of the spectral weight .",
    "we emphasize that , in contrast to @xmath205 , the principal mode @xmath206 is close to a saddle point and therefore is nearly dispersionless . in panel 3 the finite energy and momentum resolutions",
    "are taken into account .",
    "we see that the almost dispersionless main mode remains sharp but the secondary modes can no longer be resolved and are found to merge with the two magnon continuum .",
    "irrespective of the discrepancies between the results of the @xmath2 expansions and the experimental data , our calculation suggests that the lower boundary of of the measured scattering continuum in scan g could be due to unresolved transverse magnons .",
    "such a scenario had been previously considered and ruled out on the basis of the smallness of the ratio @xmath207 of spectral weights of the secondary modes to the principal mode predicted by linear spin wave theory .",
    "@xcite however , the results of the @xmath2 expansion show that spin wave interactions lead to an enhancement of this ratio for the g scan .",
    "next , we examine scan e ( panel 2 ) , which probes wave vectors near @xmath208 .",
    "linear spin wave theory predicts coherent peaks at @xmath209  mev for the principal mode and at @xmath210 mev and @xmath211  mev for the secondary modes ( see the inset in panel 2 ) .",
    "the two magnon scattering continuum is relatively weak and carries only about 23 % of the total spectral weight . in the framework of the @xmath2 expansion the principal mode",
    "is pushed upwards in energy to @xmath212  mev and occurs very close to the secondary mode @xmath213  mev .",
    "the other secondary mode @xmath142 is shifted very significantly to @xmath214  mev , but carries only a minute fraction of the spectral weight .",
    "the two magnon continuum is also shifted upwards in energy and carries approximately a quarter of the total spectral weight .",
    "once again the spin wave dispersion is close to a saddle point and as a result the effects of the finite momentum resolution are small .",
    "the main feature in the structure factor is a broad peak formed by the two unresolved @xmath198 and @xmath141 modes .",
    "this is quite similar to what is observed experimentally ( fig .",
    "5(e ) of ref .  ) .",
    "it is then tempting to speculate that the experimentally observed single peak is a result of the accidental near degeneracy of the @xmath143 and @xmath141 modes in the vicinity of @xmath215 .",
    "this would explain both the absence of the @xmath143 peak in the experimental data and the anomalously large intensity of the observed peak .    in panel 1 of fig .",
    "[ plotscan2 ] we plot the dynamical structure factor for scan b near the wave vector @xmath216 . here",
    "the polarization factor ( @xmath180 ) in ( [ crosssection ] ) leads to a strong suppression of the out - of - plane fluctuations and the scattering is almost entirely due to the in - plane @xmath217 spin wave modes .",
    "the magnon interactions renormalize @xmath142 upwards in energy to approximately @xmath218  mev , whereas the @xmath143 mode disappears in the two magnon scattering continuum .",
    "a careful analysis shows that the narrow peak at @xmath219  mev is not due to a single - particle excitation but is a feature in the two magnon scattering continuum .    the dominant contribution to the dynamical structure factor in scan",
    "a in the vicinity of the wave vector @xmath220 comes from in - plane fluctuations because the polarization factor @xmath180 suppresses out - of plane fluctuations . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ plotscan1 ] , the magnon interactions lead to a spectral weight transfer to higher energies .",
    "the peaks near @xmath221  mev and @xmath222  mev can be traced back to single - particle poles in the green s function .",
    "these poles are unphysical and are a result of the uncontrolled nature of the @xmath2 expansion for small values of @xmath42 .",
    "it is easily seen from the dyson equation ( [ green1 ] ) that a large self - energy at a given wave vector can lead to `` extra '' poles in the green s function at high energies above the two magnon continuum .",
    "the inclusion of higher order terms in the @xmath2 expansion would provide decay mechanisms at all energies and lead to a broadening of these high - energy peaks in the dynamical structure factor .",
    "last but not least let us consider the vicinity of @xmath223 ( scan c ) . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ plotscan1 ] the principal spin wave mode @xmath141 is renormalized down to a slightly lower energy of approximately @xmath218  mev .",
    "the @xmath142 mode , which occurs at @xmath224  mev in linear spin wave theory , disappears entirely in the two magnon - continuum .",
    "the feature near @xmath225  mev can again be understood in terms of an enhancement of the two magnon density of states . comparing with the neutron scattering data ( fig .",
    "5(c ) of ref .  )",
    ", the structure factor shows features quite similar to the experimentally observed continuum .",
    "however , the scattering continuum occurs at energies nearly @xmath226  mev lower than what is observed experimentally .",
    "in this work we have used nonlinear spin wave theory to determine the dynamical structure factor in the ordered phase of the spin-1/2 helimagnet cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 .",
    "we have taken into account the first subleading contribution in a @xmath2 expansion , which incorporates interactions between magnons and generates magnon decay processes as well as multi magnon scattering continua .",
    "both effects are particularly pronounced in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 due to the non - collinear spin ordering , the low spin value and geometrical frustration .",
    "we found that the results of nonlinear spin wave theory explain on a qualitative level many of the features observed in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "we find a strong scattering continuum in the dynamical structure factor similar to the experimental observations .",
    "our calculations suggest the possibility that some of the spectral weight at the low - energy boundary of the experimentally observed scattering continuum in scan g could be due to single particle excitations that are unresolved .    in the vicinity of saddle points of the spin wave dispersion relation the single - particle excitations",
    "are only weakly affected by the instrumental resolution and hence exhibit sharper peaks in the dynamical structure factor .    in spite of the qualitative agreement of the theory with experiments , crucial discrepancies remain .",
    "first and foremost , nonlinear spin wave theory fails to account for the large `` quantum renormalization '' of the main exchange parameter .",
    "this indicates that ( to order @xmath227 ) the @xmath2 expansion still underestimates the effects of quantum fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , there are significant quantitative differences between our calculations and the experimentally observed structure factor .",
    "one may speculate that a better agreement with experiment could be achieved by taking higher - order terms in the @xmath2 expansion into account .",
    "the main lesson to be learned from our calculations is that cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 falls somewhere in between the two theoretical scenarios that have been proposed previously .",
    "our analysis shows that the physics of order plays an essential part in understanding the dynamic response cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 at low temperatures : a large fraction of the spectral weight is carried by spin wave modes , which occur over a large range of frequencies . this is a strong indication that a putative spin - liquid ground state is plainly not a good starting point for the description of the ordered phase of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 . on the other hand",
    "we have seen that ( in low orders in @xmath2 ) nonlinear spin wave theory significantly underestimates the effects of quantum fluctuations and hence expansions around the ordered state also fail to account for the experimental observations .",
    "nonlinear spin wave theory can also be applied to investigate the effects of magnetic fields .",
