    "an experimental observation of the leptonic cp violation and a determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy will be central issues in forthcoming next - generation neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "recent findings of relatively large @xmath6  @xcite have boosted the momentum of the neutrino physics community towards addressing these issues . for",
    "a success of the next - generation experiments , a more precise interpretation of data will be necessary .",
    "this means that more precise knowledge of neutrino - nucleus reactions is critically important because neutrinos are detected in the experiments through observing remnants of the neutrino - nucleus reactions .",
    "neutrino experiments utilize neutrinos in a wide energy range , and therefore the relevant neutrino - nucleus reactions have various microscopic reaction mechanisms depending on the kinematics . for a relatively low - energy neutrino ( @xmath71  gev )",
    "relevant to , e.g. , the t2k  @xcite , miniboone  @xcite , and nuprism  @xcite experiments , the dominant reaction mechanisms are the quasi - elastic ( qe ) knockout of a nucleon , and quasi - free excitation of the @xmath8 resonance followed by a decay into a @xmath5 final state . for a higher - energy neutrino ( @xmath94  gev )",
    "relevant to , e.g. , the miner@xmath10a  @xcite and future dune  @xcite experiments , a large portion of data are from higher resonance excitations and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . in order to understand the neutrino - nucleus reactions of these different characteristics , obviously , it is important to combine different expertise .",
    "for example , nuclear theorists and neutrino experimentalists recently organized a collaboration at the j - parc branch of the kek theory center  @xcite to tackle this challenging problem .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on studying the neutrino reactions in the resonance region where the total hadronic energy @xmath11 extends , @xmath12  gev ; @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the nucleon ( pion ) mass . furthermore , as a step toward developing a neutrino - nucleus reaction model , we will be concerned with the neutrino reaction on a single nucleon . in the resonance region , particularly between the @xmath8 and dis regions , we are still in the stage of developing a single nucleon model that is a basic ingredient to construct a neutrino - nucleus reaction model . first we discuss experimental data that are crucial to determine form factors associated with axial @xmath15-@xmath16 ( @xmath16 : nucleon resonance ) transitions . because of small cross sections , neutrino data are rather scarce .",
    "available data are from old bubble chamber experiments at the argonne national laboratory ( anl )  @xcite and the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite ; hydrogen and deuterium targets were used in the experiments . the single pion production data for @xmath72  gev are particularly useful , and theoretical models are confronted with the data to fix ( or test ) the strength of the predominant axial @xmath15-@xmath8 transition .",
    "however , there has been the well - known discrepancy between the two datasets from anl and bnl by @xmath1710% .",
    "this discrepancy is reflected in the uncertainty of the axial @xmath18 coupling , leading to theoretical uncertainty for neutrino - nucleus reaction cross sections . regarding this ,",
    "an interesting progress has been reported recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the reference",
    ", the authors tried to avoid the neutrino flux uncertainty of the old bubble chamber experiments .",
    "they took advantage of the fact that the ratio @xmath19 is fairly unaffected by the neutrino flux uncertainty , and that @xmath20 on the deuterium is relatively well understood . here",
    ", we denoted the cross section for the single-@xmath21 production [ no @xmath21-emission process , mainly qe ] by @xmath22 [ @xmath20 ] .",
    "multiplying @xmath19 from the two experiments by @xmath20 from the genie 2.8  @xcite , they obtained @xmath22 for the two experiments .",
    "they found that the newly obtained @xmath22 are both fairly close to the original anl data .",
    "once this result is established , theoretical uncertainty associated with the strength of the axial @xmath18 coupling will be significantly reduced .    another interesting analysis relevant to anl and",
    "bnl data has been conducted by one of the present authors and his coworkers in ref .",
    "they examined effects of the final state interactions ( fsi ) on cross sections for the single pion production off the deuteron .",
    "they found that the orthogonality between the deuteron and final @xmath24 scattering wave functions significantly reduces the cross sections .",
    "thus the anl and bnl data from deuterium target would need more careful analysis with the fsi taken into account . while this kind of reanalysis is important , still the available data are rather scarce .",
    "it is highly desirable to have new data that are more precise and abundant .",
    "there is an idea  @xcite to upgrade the near detector of the t2k experiment to use d@xmath25o as a target and study this important elementary process .    regarding theoretical models ,",
    "several models have been developed for neutrino - nucleon reactions in the resonance region ; particularly the @xmath8 region has been extensively studied because of its importance .",
    "those models can be categorized into three classes according to their dynamical contents .",
    "the first class gives amplitudes as a sum of breit - wigner functions that represent resonant contributions .",
    "an example of this type developed recently is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and they considered @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 resonances .",
    "the second class of models considers tree - level non - resonant mechanisms in addition to resonant ones of the breit - wigner type .",
    "for example , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite derived tree - level non - resonant mechanisms from a chiral lagrangian , and combined them with @xmath8 of the breit - wigner type .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite has been further extended by including the @xmath29 resonance  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite developed a model that contains all 4-star resonances with masses below 1.8  gev , and included rather phenomenological non - resonant contributions .",
    "a model of the third class additionally takes account of the hadronic rescattering , so that the unitarity of the amplitude is satisfied .",
    "one of the present authors has developed such a model that works for the @xmath8 region  @xcite .",
    "a more complete list of existing models for the resonance region can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although substantial efforts have been made recently as seen above , there still remain conceptual and/or practical problems in the existing models as follows :    1 .",
    "we point out that reactions in the resonance region are multi - channel processes in nature .",
    "the relevant channels such as @xmath30 are strongly coupled with each other through the strong interaction .",
    "therefore , the multi - channel couplings required by the unitarity are essential physics to be considered . however , no existing model takes account of this",
    "the neutrino - induced double pion production over the entire resonance region has not been seriously studied previously .",
    "as known from the photo- and electron - reactions , cross sections for the double - pion production are comparable or even larger than those for the single - pion production around and beyond the second resonance region , and a similar tendency is expected for the neutrino reactions .",
    "therefore , it is important to have a good estimate for the double - pion production rate .",
    "although some neutrino - induced double - pion production models have been developed previously  @xcite , they are supposed to work for the threshold region only , a very limited kinematics in the whole resonance region .",
    "thus for a practical calculation of neutrino reactions , for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite extrapolated a dis model to the resonance region , and gradually switched on its contribution for @xmath31  gev , thereby simulating the double - pion contributions .",
    "this is not a well - justified procedure , and obviously the situation for the double - pion production models is unsatisfactory .",
    "interference between resonant and non - resonant amplitudes are not well under control for the axial - current in most of the previous models .",
    "this is due to the fact that the axial - current was not constructed in a manner consistent with the @xmath5 interaction model .",
    "more detailed discussion on this will be given later in sec .",
    "[ sec : axial - nstar ] .",
    "our goal here is to develop a neutrino - nucleon reaction model in the resonance region by overcoming the problems discussed above . in order to do so , the best available option would be to work with a coupled - channels model . in the last few years",
    ", we have developed a dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model to analyze @xmath0 reaction data for a study of the baryon spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "in there , we have shown that the model is successful in giving a reasonable fit to a large amount ( @xmath17 23,000 data points ) of the data .",
    "the model also has been shown to give a reasonable prediction for the pion - induced double pion productions  @xcite .",
    "thus the dcc model seems a promising starting point for developing a neutrino - reaction model in the resonance region . at @xmath32 ,",
    "we already have made an extension of the dcc model to the neutrino sector by invoking the pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) hypothesis  @xcite . at this",
    "particular kinematics , the cross section is given by the divergence of the axial - current amplitude that is related to the @xmath5 amplitude through the pcac relation .",
    "however , for describing the neutrino reactions in the whole kinematical region ( @xmath33 ) , a dynamical model for the vector- and axial - currents is needed . here",
    "are what we need to do in practice for extending the dcc model to cover the neutrino reactions .",
    "regarding the vector current , we already have fixed the amplitude for the proton target at @xmath34=0 in our previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "the remaining task is to determine the @xmath34-dependence of the vector couplings , i.e. , form factors .",
    "this can be done by analyzing data for the single pion electroproduction and inclusive electron scattering .",
    "a similar analysis also needs to be done with the neutron target model . by combining the vector current amplitudes for the proton and neutron targets",
    ", we can do the isospin separation of the vector current .",
    "this is a necessary step before calculating neutrino processes . as for the axial - current matrix elements at @xmath34=0",
    ", we derive them so that the consistency , required by the pcac relation , with the dcc @xmath5 interaction model is maintained . as a result of this derivation ,",
    "the interference pattern between the resonant and non - resonant amplitudes are uniquely fixed within our model ; this is an advantage of our approach . for the @xmath34-dependence of the axial - current matrix elements , we still inevitably need to employ a simple ansatz due to the lack of experimental information .",
    "this is a limitation shared by all the existing neutrino - reaction models in the resonance region .    with the vector- and axial - current models",
    "as described above , we calculate the neutrino - induced meson productions in the resonance region .",
    "we compare our numerical results with available data for single - pion , double - pion , and kaon productions .",
    "particularly , comparison with the double - pion production data is made for the first time with the relevant resonance contributions and coupled - channels effects taken into account ; the previous double - pion production models did not include resonant contributions  @xcite , or include a @xmath28 resonance contribution only  @xcite .",
    "also , a comparison with other models would be interesting .",
    "thus we will compare structure functions from the dcc model with those from the models of refs .",

    "[ fig : lp ] , we show @xmath340 for the cc reaction on the proton ( neutron ) going to the @xmath5 final state . from the comparison , a good agreement between the dcc model and the lpp model is found only near the @xmath8 peak ; otherwise they are rather different . the rs model rather undershoot the @xmath8 peak , as has been also pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite . near the threshold ( @xmath327 1.1  gev ) , meanwhile , @xmath395 of the dcc model is larger than those of the lpp and rs models .",
    "a similar tendency persists in the inclusive @xmath340 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lp2 ] . for the lpp model ,",
    "@xmath398 in the left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : lp ] and [ fig : lp2 ] are the same because only the @xmath8 contributes to the proton - target process , and it decays almost exclusively into the @xmath5 state . as discussed earlier in this paper , @xmath340 at @xmath32 is related to the @xmath5 cross sections through the pcac relation , and thus is given almost model - independently .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrino - f2 ] that @xmath340 from the dcc axial current model and that from the precise @xmath5 model agree well in accordance with the pcac relation .",
    "therefore , the difference between the dcc model and the lpp and the rs models in @xmath341 reveals a consequence of missing the consistency between the axial - current and the @xmath5 interaction in the latter models .",
    "in this work , we have developed a dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model for neutrino - nucleon reactions in the resonance region .",
    "our starting point is the dcc model that we have developed through a comprehensive analysis of @xmath311 data for @xmath1  gev  @xcite .",
    "the model has also been shown to give a reasonable description of @xmath399  @xcite . in order to extend the dcc model of ref .",
    "@xcite to what works for the neutrino reactions , we analyzed data for the single pion photoproduction off the neutron , and also data for the electron scattering on both proton and neutron targets . through the analysis , we determined the @xmath34-dependence of the vector form factors up to @xmath400  ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath4 . by combining the vector form factors for the proton and neutron",
    ", we separated the vector form factors into the isovector and isoscalar parts ; this isospin separation is a necessary step to apply the model to the neutrino reactions .",
    "we also derived the axial - current matrix elements .",
    "an appealing point of our approach is that we can derive the axial - current matrix elements that are linked to the @xmath5 potential of the dcc model through the pcac relation . as a consequence ,",
    "relative phases between the non - resonant and resonant axial current amplitudes are uniquely determined within the dcc model .",
    "the @xmath34-dependences of the axial form factors are difficult to determine with the available data .",
    "thus we used the same axial form factors for all the axial @xmath15-@xmath16 vertices .",
    "although this prescription is what we can do best for the moment , we hope to improve this in future if more data become available .",
    "then , the preparation for calculating the neutrino - induced meson productions off the nucleon is completed .",
    "we have presented cross sections for the neutrino - induced meson productions for @xmath312  gev . in this energy region ,",
    "the single - pion production gives the largest contribution . towards @xmath355  gev ,",
    "the cross section for the double - pion production is getting larger to become 1/8 ( 1/4 ) of the single - pion production cross section for the proton ( neutron ) target .",
    "because our dcc model has been determined by analyzing the @xmath0 data , we can also make a quantitative prediction for the neutrino cross sections for @xmath173 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 productions .",
    "we found that cross sections for @xmath401 and @xmath177 productions are @xmath402-@xmath403 times smaller than those for the single pion production .",
    "we have compared our numerical results with the available experimental data . for the single - pion production ,",
    "our result , for which the axial @xmath15-@xmath16 couplings are fixed by the pcac relation , is consistent with the bnl data for @xmath404 , while fair agreement with both anl and bnl data is found for the neutron target data . through the comparison with the single pion production data for @xmath4051.4  gev",
    "for which the @xmath8-excitation is the dominant mechanism , we were able to study the strength and the @xmath34-dependence of the axial @xmath15-@xmath8 coupling .",
    "we also calculated double - pion production cross sections by taking account of relevant resonance contributions for the first time , and compared them with the data .",
    "we found a good agreement for @xmath390 and @xmath356 , but not for @xmath389 . because the data are statistically rather poor , it is difficult to make a conclusive judgement on the dcc model .",
    "we hope new high quality data will become available in near future .",
    "we examined reaction mechanisms contributing to the single - pion production . for the proton target where only @xmath263 states contribute ,",
    "the @xmath8 dominates .",
    "however , for the neutron target where both @xmath262 and 3/2 states contribute , the @xmath8 , higher @xmath16 resonances , and non - resonant mechanisms give comparable contributions towards @xmath355  gev .",
    "thus it is very important to have interference patterns among those different mechanisms under control . in this",
    "regard , our dcc approach has an advantage over the other existing models , as mentioned in the above paragraph .",
    "finally , we make some remarks on our future prospect .",
    "our dcc model should be smoothly connected to a dis model in the resonance - dis overlapping region . because the dcc model still has degrees of freedom to vary the @xmath34-dependence of the axial form factors , we can adjust them to fit the @xmath11- and @xmath34-dependences of inclusive cross sections from the dis model in the overlapping region .",
    "this needs be done in a future work .",
    "having developed the dcc neutrino - nucleon reaction model that covers the whole resonance region , next task should be developing a neutrino - nucleus reaction model in which the dcc model describes the elementary processes .",
    "the simplest case is the neutrino - deuteron reactions , and for that , we can do a relatively well - established quantum mechanical calculation , as done in ref .",
    ". it will be interesting to extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by replacing the elementary amplitudes therein with those from the dcc model developed here .",
    "then , anl and bnl data should be reanalyzed with this model that takes care of not only the fermi motion but also the final state interactions ( fsi ) . the importance of fsi has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "also , this development can serve as a preparation for a possible t2k experiment  @xcite that utilizes heavy - water ( d@xmath25o ) as the target .",
    "application to heavier nuclei will also be very important . in the @xmath8 region",
    ", the well - developed @xmath148-hole model  @xcite may give a hint to address pion productions in the neutrino - nucleus reaction .",
    "for even higher energy neutrino reactions , a fully quantum mechanical calculation seems formidable .",
    "combining the elementary amplitudes of the dcc model with a hadron transport model may be a possible and practical option , as has been done in the literature  @xcite .",
