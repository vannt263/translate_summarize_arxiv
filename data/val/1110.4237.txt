    "you might have suspected that my title is too timely , but as a matter of fact , it was a speculative one when it was proposed to one of the conveners in early may , much earlier than the announcement of @xmath1 appearance events at t2k @xcite .",
    "the resulted six clean events which fulfill the criteria for electron - like events in sk strongly suggest that @xmath0 has a nonzero value .",
    "their best fit value is around @xmath2 close to the chooz limit @xcite .",
    "it was soon followed by the minos collaboration which also obtained a relatively large value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in fact , by taking account of these new data from t2k and minos into the global analysis the bari group concluded that it implies evidence for nonzero @xmath0 at confidence level ( cl ) higher than @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath4 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "i believe it an urgent matter to discuss what are the consequences of suggested large values of @xmath0 though it must be confirmed by the further running of these experiments as well as the ongoing reactor @xmath0 experiments @xcite .",
    "i stated in a talk in neutrino 2008 in christchurch that `` my personal prejudice is that @xmath0 is relatively large .",
    "if it is true it further encourages us to proceed to search for lepton cp violation and determination of the mass hierarchy '' @xcite .",
    "here is a brief recapitulation of the very simple reasoning which led me to the above statement .",
    "the lepton flavor mixing matrix , the mns matrix @xcite , @xmath5 , is a `` relative matrix '' @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the unitary matrices which diagonalize the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices , respectively .",
    "the mns matrix is composed of the three angles @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and a cp violating phase @xmath11 , the lepton analogue of the quark kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "two of the angles are known to be large , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "then , it is highly unlikely that only the remaining angle @xmath0 is extremely small , unless there is a good reason for tuning only @xmath0 into a small value .",
    "that is , if a symmetry exists such that @xmath0 vanishes at the symmetry limit , there is a natural reason why only @xmath0 is small among the three mixing angles .",
    "there exists many examples for such symmetry including @xmath15 symmetry and discrete symmetries . for a review",
    "see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is my prejudice that the large @xmath0 suggested by t2k and minos measurement , if confirmed , would give a tough time for these symmetries which aims at explaining small @xmath0 , unless a large correction to the symmetry limit is shown to be naturally induced .",
    "without having compelling reasons for large @xmath0 , one had to take into account the possibility that @xmath0 is small in thinking about ways for measurement of cp phase and determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "that is why many of the existing proposals for such apparatus naturally include those that have sensitivities to a tiny value of @xmath0 with varying limiting values .",
    "they include , for example ( sorry for my arbitrary choice ) , neutrino factory @xcite , beta beam @xcite , superbeam enriched with two detectors @xcite , and their combination @xcite . for their sensitivities see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "i wonder , however , that racing for @xmath0 sensitivity could have produced an atmosphere that the better facility is the one which has sensitivities to smaller values of @xmath0 . in seeing the t2k and minos indication for large @xmath0",
    ", i believe that it is the time to start thinking about changing the gear to more relevant things .    what is good if @xmath0 is as large as @xmath16 ?",
    "my first answer is that a wide range of possibilities becomes open for strategies and setups aiming at exploring lepton cp violation through neutrino oscillation .",
    "i believe that in the context of conventional superbeam @xcite unambiguous evidence for lepton cp violation requires a megaton scale water cherenkov detector , or a @xmath17 kton liquid ar detector @xcite . yet , the suggested large value of @xmath0 , still need to be confirmed and assumed here , stimulates to examine other possibilities such as reactor - accelerator combined method @xcite , combining different accelerator measurement @xcite , or the one adding one more new facility which may or may not require an extensive cost @xcite .",
    "some more exotic options are discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the cern - memphys project , despite an almost vacuum setting , has a reasonable sensitivity to the mass hierarchy to @xmath18 before combining with atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .",
    "sometime ago the cp sensitivity achievable by the reactor - accelerator combined method was examined in detail @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this analysis indicate that combining data taken and to be taken by all planned experiments is not enough to guarantee discovery of cp violation in @xmath11 coverage of more than 30% in most of the allowed region of @xmath0 even though one assumes that the mass hierarchy is known .",
    "it should be noticed , as observed and emphasized in @xcite , that the cp sensitivity is severely damaged by the parameter degeneracy due to unknown neutrino mass hierarchies @xcite .",
    "for a recent overview of the parameter degeneracy see @xcite .",
    "i believe that the one of the most important implications of the assumed large value of @xmath0 is that one can think of `` all in one '' ( _ obento _ in japanese , everything in a lunch box ) approach . as we saw in the above , a traditional approaches for cp and the mass hierarchy entailed in aggressive proposals @xcite to include a very small value of @xmath0 within the scope . though powerful and",
    "the redundancy is of course welcome , they may not be the optimal cost - effective apparatus for large @xmath0 .",
    "to my opinion , what is good in living in the world with large @xmath0 is that one can achieve the same goal by less expensive `` all in one '' setting .",
    "more concretely , i mean by it a single detector ( such as a megaton water cherenkov detector ) assuming prior existence of intense neutrino beam .",
    "timely enough the loi of hyper - kamiokande ( hyper - k ) project has just appeared @xcite .",
    "therefore , let us briefly discuss the spirit of the `` all in one '' approach by taking this concrete setting .    with intense neutrino beam from 1.66 mw proton driver at j - parc it is demonstrated that hyper - k with 0.56 megaton fiducial mass has a superb performance for discovery of cp violation , which covers most of the region of @xmath0 allowed at 3@xmath19 cl @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "24 of @xcite which assumes the known mass hierarchy and for 1.5 ( 3.5 ) years of neutrino ( antineutrino ) running .",
    "it shows a remarkable accuracy of determination of @xmath11 with 1@xmath19 error smaller than 20 degree for @xmath20 .",
    "however , if the mass hierarchy is unknown the analysis suffers from the sign-@xmath21 degeneracy @xcite .",
    "while allowing clean measurement of cp violation , a drawback of setting with such short baseline is that it is difficult to determine the mass hierarchy , another important goal of future neutrino experiments .",
    "that is why many proposals for determining all the unknowns in neutrino parameters exploit baselines of several thousand km .",
    "if @xmath0 is large , however , the mass hierarchy can be determined by high - statistics observation of atmospheric neutrinos , the idea discussed by many authors .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for early references .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite indicates that the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy depend very much on which octant @xmath22 lives but it can be carried out by @xmath23 years running of hyper - k for large @xmath0 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that having other capabilities such as proton decay discovery is of crucial importance .",
    "i emphasize that the realization of `` all in one '' approach is , of course , not limited to this particular version discussed above .",
    "but , it is certainly encouraging to see the concrete example appeared which is armed with the realistic simulations based on their long - term experiences at super - k .",
    "is theoretical treatment of neutrino oscillation well oiled when a large value of @xmath0 close to the chooz limit is established ?",
    "for example , does the well known treatment of the degeneracy @xcite need modification ?",
    "if yes , to what extent ?     computed numerically as a function of energy ( green dashed line ) , the one calculated by the cervera _",
    "_ formula ( blue dash - dotted line ) , and with our formula with large @xmath0 corrections ( red solid line ) .",
    "the left and the right panels are for baselines @xmath24 km and @xmath25 km for which the matter density is taken as 2.8 g/@xmath26 and 3.6 g/@xmath26 , respectively . , title=\"fig:\",width=241 ]   computed numerically as a function of energy ( green dashed line ) , the one calculated by the cervera _",
    "_ formula ( blue dash - dotted line ) , and with our formula with large @xmath0 corrections ( red solid line ) . the left and the right panels are for baselines @xmath24 km and @xmath25 km for which the matter density is taken as 2.8 g/@xmath26 and 3.6 g/@xmath26 , respectively .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=241 ]    to answer these questions a framework dubbed as `` @xmath27 perturbation theory '' ( @xmath28 ) has been formulated @xcite by assuming @xmath29 , which roughly corresponds to the chooz limit . by doing",
    "so one can systematically compute the large-@xmath0 corrections to the cervera _",
    "et al . _ formula @xcite",
    ". while large corrections arise in certain limited region of energy and baseline as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fpemu_1000 - 4000 ] , one can show on general ground that the correction terms are of order @xmath30 .",
    "( by general argument one can show that they are the terms proportional to either @xmath31 or @xmath32 @xcite . ) therefore , the large-@xmath0 correction to the degenerate solutions obtained with the cervera _",
    "_ formula , generally speaking , is not sizable .",
    "see @xcite for more detail .",
    "assuming that the t2k and minos hints for large @xmath0 will be confirmed , i argued that we are at the turning point of thinking of our strategy of how to explore the remaining unknowns in the lepton flavor mixing . in particular , it allows us to rely on `` all in one '' approach .",
    "i hope that the personal view can be strengthened by further exploration toward nufact 2012 .",
