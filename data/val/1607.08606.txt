    "the @xmath10 case is considerably more complex , but may lend itself well to binary stellar systems which contain dust , minor planets or major planets .",
    "a recent significant advancement in the @xmath10 case was provided by @xcite , who fully characterized all central configurations of four planar bodies , at least two of which contain equal masses , and with an axis of symmetry between the other two bodies .",
    "the importance of the result was promoted by @xcite , who suggested several potential mathematical extensions .    rather than pursue any of those perhaps daunting challenges ,",

    ", zero - mass objects could represent a variety of objects , such as dust grains , pebbles or asteroids .",
    "implementing these mass assumptions immediately yields one result : no solutions exist for cases # 3 or # 5 .",

    "[ sumfig ] . consequently , there exist no planar 4-body central configurations in binary - star planetary systems where the line of symmetry lies connects both stars and two equal - mass objects are `` external '' to both stars .    for the remaining cases , indicated by green check marks in fig .",

    "one immediate striking observation is that the simple a priori restriction of @xmath47  @xmath48  @xmath49 , @xmath50  @xmath48  @xmath49 and @xmath51  @xmath52  @xmath53  @xmath52  @xmath49 reduces the relevant @xmath19 phase space range from @xmath54 ( see equations [ alpha12 ] and [ kappa12 ] ) to about @xmath55 , and the @xmath20 phase space range of @xmath56 ( see equations [ beta12 ] , [ kappa12 ] and [ lambda12 ] ) to about @xmath57 .",
    "another visually apparent feature is that mass ratios of @xmath58 hug the lower boundary of the allowed region , whereas mass ratios of @xmath59 instead approach the location of the red dot ( @xmath60 ) , thereby showcasing the asymmetry produced from unequal stellar masses .",
    "most of the allowed region is then restricted to @xmath61  @xmath48  @xmath47  @xmath48  @xmath49 and @xmath61  @xmath48  @xmath50  @xmath48  @xmath49 , meaning that asteroid , pebbles or other small objects are confined strongly to the location of the red dot .",
    "the formal limit of both @xmath47 and @xmath50 at this value is infinity , meaning that arbitrarily small objects can exist in central configurations there .    as emphasized by fig .",
    "[ case1distance ] , the location of the red dot indicates when an equilateral triangle configuration is formed between both stars and either substellar object with mass @xmath3 .",

    "[ case2mass]-[case2distance ] . in case # 2 ,",
    "the stellar masses are equal and do not define the axis of symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , the inequality of the masses of the substellar objects still produce a noticeable difference in the locations of the lightly - coloured regions between both panels of fig .",
    "[ case2mass ] . just as for case # 1 ,",
    "the restriction of phase space due to the assumption of a planetary system is similarly stark : down to a range of about @xmath64 in both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "only super - jupiter mass planets could exist in central configurations more than a few tenths of a degree away from @xmath63 for either angle .",
    "the values of the mass ratios @xmath65 and @xmath66 both approach infinity as the red dot ( @xmath67 ) is itself approached , indicating that @xmath68 and @xmath69 is allowed .",
    "the red dot corresponds to a rhombus similar to that produced from the critical red dot location in case # 1 , except rotated by @xmath70 and in the limit that both stars have equal masses .",
    "case # 4 is a fundamentally different geometry than cases # 1 and # 2 .",
    "this difference is reflected in how the allowed phase space in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is restricted ( figs .",
    "[ case4mass]-[case4distance ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is restricted to @xmath71 while @xmath20 is restricted to @xmath72 .",
    "effectively , these restrictions place @xmath12 nearly in - between both stars such that @xmath11 is in a near - equilateral triangle configuration with the three near - co - linear bodies . at the critical point ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 approach zero .",
    "this combination of a co - linear configuration with an equilateral triangle configuration represents a superposition of two three - body central configurations .      case # 6 is geometrically equivalent to case # 4 except for the location of the centre of mass .",
    "this difference creates a significant change in the allowed @xmath19-@xmath20 phase - space region ( figs .",

    "this study demonstrates that central configurations in binary - star planetary systems may exist , and quantifies the extent of the existence region . whether objects residing in the immediate vicinity of these configurations are long - term stable and have plausible dynamical origins are different questions .",
    "a proper stability analysis of planar four - body central configurations with two equal masses and an axis of symmetry connecting the unequal masses has not yet been carried out , and could represent a significant undertaking .",
    "the results here might help focus that effort by quantifying the variations in geometries and mass that result from the most basic planetary system - based restrictions .",
    "regarding the likelihood of a planetary system forming or settling into one of the central configurations discussed here , the chances probably increase as the substellar masses decrease .",
    "all these central configurations include objects which are nearly co - orbital or nearly co - linear .",
    "no planets as massive as jupiter have yet to be found in such architectures .",
    "the largest known co - orbital objects in the solar system are janus ( @xmath79 kg ) and epimetheus ( @xmath80 kg ) , and in extrasolar systems is a minor planet with its disrupted fragments orbiting white dwarf wd 1145 + 017 ; the mass of this minor planet is likely to be about @xmath81  kg , a tenth of the mass of ceres @xcite .",
    "multiple co - orbital masses above @xmath82  kg are roughly assumed to become unstable at the 20 per cent level @xcite",
    ". three or more co - linear planetary objects are not known to exist in stable configurations .",
    "the fact that the majority of planets in the solar system host at least one trojan asteroid might indicate that capture into that central configuration is common .",

    ". the binary stars could have wide separations of @xmath83 au or close separations of @xmath84 au .",
    "such close separations are unlikely to host objects in central configurations because any bodies so close to those stars would either be drawn in and destroyed due to tides , or blown away by winds . for particularly wide separations , comparable to where stellar flybys or planet - planet scattering might deposit planets or planetary debris into an exosystem @xcite , capture into a central configuration is a distinct possibility .",
    "central configurations are complete analytic solutions to the @xmath0-body problem and hence allow one to determine the exact past and future evolution of a gravitational system of point masses without the need for numerical integration .",
    "i have quantified where in phase space do central configurations exist for coplanar four - body binary - star exoplanetary systems containing one axis of symmetry , two stars whose masses are within a factor of ten of each other , and two substellar bodies whose masses are no greater than a tenth of either stellar mass .",
    "i found that these basic mass restrictions  which satisfy virtually every known planetary system  significantly restrict the geometries in which central configurations may occur to within a few degrees of two architectures and ten degrees of a third .",
    "these architectures are all extensions of the well - known observed sun - jupiter - trojan configuration , and occur in the limit of zero - mass substellar masses .",
    "the first architecture ( cases  # 1 and # 2 ) is a rhombus with both stars at opposite ends whose associated internal angles are @xmath62 .",
    "the second ( case  # 4 ) features a co - linear configuration of two equal - mass stars plus one substellar body , with the second substellar body forming an equilateral triangle .",
    "the third ( case  # 6 ) is an equilateral triangle configuration with the two substellar masses at one vertex .    as the mass of substellar bodies ( which may be e.g. planets , asteroids , pebbles , dust ) increases , the deviation from these limiting architectures must increase in order to achieve the central configuration .",
    "these mass restrictions also importantly exclude central configurations for the architectures of cases # 3 and # 5 .",
    "binary stars need not be of equal mass nor classed as close nor wide in order to achieve central configurations .",
