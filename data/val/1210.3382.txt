    "in the context of classical field theories , configurations with nontrivial topology , generically named _ topological defects _ , arise  as finite energy solutions to some nonlinear models . in the standard approach ,",
    "such models are usually endowed by a symmetry breaking potential for the matter self - interaction , since topological defects are known to be formed during symmetry breaking phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the simplest topological defect is the static kink , which arises in a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theory containing a single real scalar field @xcite .",
    "other well - known examples of topological structures are the vortex configurations , which appear in effective planar models containing a complex scalar field coupled to an abelian gauge field @xcite , and the magnetic monopole , which stand for the static solution arising from a ( 1 + 3)-dimensional theory describing the interaction between a real scalar triplet and non - abelian gauge fields @xcite .    in particular , magnetic monopoles are spherically symmetric configurations coming from a static yang - mills theory endowed with a fourth - order higgs potential @xcite . in this case , these solutions exhibit no divergences and possess finite total energy , since they are constrained by a set of suitable boundary conditions . on the other hand , in the absence of a higgs potential , magnetic monopoles arise as the minimal energy configurations of the corresponding yang - mills model @xcite . in this context ,",
    "such solutions come from a set of first - order differential equations , and minimize the total energy of the overall theory .",
    "furthermore , during the last years , some generalized or effective field theory models , generically named k - field theories , have been intensively investigated .",
    "the main difference between them and their canonical counterparts is the presence of nonstandard kinetic terms , which change the dynamics of the overall system in an exotic way .",
    "in fact , such theories have been used as effective models mainly in cosmology , with the so - called k - essence models @xcite suggesting new insights about  the accelerated inflationary phase of the universe @xcite .",
    "the interesting point is that the introduction of generalized kinetic terms has important consequences on the formation of topological structures . despite the possibility of achieving nontrivial topologically configurations even in the absence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon @xcite",
    ", some k - field models endowed with spontaneous symmetry breaking also support topological defects @xcite . in the last case",
    ", the resulting solutions can be studied via the comparison between them and their canonical counterparts , with the observation that they usually present slight variations on some of their main features @xcite .    on the other hand , in the presence of a generalized dynamics ,",
    "the resulting model is highly nonlinear , its solutions being quite hard to find , even in the presence of suitable boundary conditions . in this context ,",
    "the development of a consistent first - order framework is quite useful , since new topological configurations can be found by solving a set of generalized bps equations . as it happens in the usual case ,",
    "these new configurations minimize the energy of the overall system by saturating its lower bound bogo .",
    "recently , some of us have performed the development of generalized first - order frameworks regarding several effective field theories @xcite .",
    "however , for simplicity , these models were constructed containing only abelian fields . in the present work ,",
    "we go further by presenting a first - order theoretical framework consistent with a * *  * * generalized yang - mills - higgs model .",
    "this model is controlled by two dimensionless positive functions , @xmath0 and @xmath3 , which change the dynamics of the non - abelian fields in a nonusual way .",
    "nevertheless , in order to guarantee the self - duality of the model , @xmath4 and @xmath5 * *  * * are related by means of a simple constraint . as in the usual case",
    ", the total energy of the generalized model is also bounded from below , and the spherically symmetric self - dual solutions describe generalized bps magnetic monopoles . moreover , in the appropriate limit , our framework leads to the usual one , as expected .",
    "in order to present our results , this work is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ general ] , we introduce the nonstandard yang - mills - higgs model and the corresponding first - order theoretical framework , including its generalized bps equations .",
    "then , instead of recovering the usual case , we introduce an explicit generalized model , which is controlled by a single real parameter , @xmath6 . in sec .",
    "*  * [ numerical2 ] , we present the numerical solution of the generalized bps equations obtained by means of the relaxation technique .",
    "we depict the profiles of the higgs and non - abelian gauge fields describing the generalized bps magnetic monopoles",
    ". we also comment on the main features of these solutions . in sec .",
    "[ end ] , we finalize by summarizing our results and stating our perspectives .",
    "we begin introducing a generalized version of the yang - mills - higgs model which is defined by the following lagrangian density * * : * * @xmath7where all fields , coordinates and parameters are supposed to be dimensionless ( this can be achieved by using the appropriate mass rescaling transformations ) .",
    "we use standard conventions , including the natural units system .",
    "here,@xmath8is the usual non - abelian field strength , and@xmath9stands for the non - abelian covariant derivative , @xmath10 is the metric for the ( 1 + 3)-dimensional spacetime , and @xmath11 is the completely antisymmetric tensor ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "we point out that @xmath0 and @xmath13 are arbitrary functions which change the dynamics of the overall model in a nonusual way .",
    "it is well - known that , in the usual case ( i.e. , given @xmath14 ) , self - dual configurations only exist in the absence of the higgs potential .",
    "so , for simplicity , we  also assume that their generalized counterparts only exist for @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that such generalized configurations are described by the standard spherically symmetric _ _ ansatz__@xmath16 where @xmath17 . since we are  searching for static configurations , we choose @xmath18 .",
    "the profile functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are supposed to obey the usual finite energy boundary conditions@xmath21@xmath22 these conditions guarantee not only the existence of finite energy configurations , but also the breaking of the so(3 ) symmetry inherent to the model ( [ 1 ] ) .    in general , the weight functions @xmath0 and @xmath13 can be arbitrarily chosen , so that the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath19 and @xmath23 are quite hard to solve , even in the presence of the suitable boundary conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) . in this context",
    ", the development of a consistent self - dual theoretical framework is more than desirable , since it allows to find a set of first - order differential equations that leads to finite energy configurations attained by numerical procedures .",
    "these configurations are genuine solutions of the overall model ,  once they automatically fulfill the nonstandard euler - lagrange equations coming from lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) .    from now on",
    "we focus our attention on the development of a bps theoretical framework consistent with the nonstandard model ( [ 1 ] ) . in order to perform it",
    ", we follow the usual approach , observing * *  * * that the first - order equations come from the minimization of the total energy of the system , given by the energy - momentum tensor zero - zero component . in the present case , such tensor reads@xmath24 from which one gets the nonstandard energy density ( already written in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath23)@xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that such functions must be positive in order to avoid problems with the energy of the model .",
    "given the _",
    "ansatz _ ( [ a ] ) , we point out that this model only engenders self - dual solutions when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related to each other  as@xmath28 in this case , the energy density ( [ de ] ) can be rewritten in the form@xmath29 whose minimization leads to the following first - order equations:@xmath30@xmath31 relations ( [ bps1 ] ) and ( [ bps2 ] ) are the self - dual ( bps )  equations of the model ( [ 1 ] ) .  after implementing these equations , the bps  energy density becomes@xmath32 and the total energy of the solutions",
    "is given by@xmath33 whenever the boundary conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "in summary , for a given positive function @xmath34 , the first - order equations  ( [ bps1 ] ) and ( [ bps2 ] ) must be numerically solved in accordance with the finite energy boundary conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) .",
    "the self - dual solutions achieved in this way describe the generalized bps magnetic monopoles arising from this nonstandard yang - mills - higgs model ( [ 1 ] ) , with total energy given by ( [ te ] ) and energy density by ( [ buc ] ) .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to point out that the generalized first - order framework presented in this letter only holds in the absence of the potential @xmath35",
    ". furthermore , @xmath4 and @xmath5  have to obey the constraint ( [ v ] ) . on the other hand , for a nonvanishing potential , or in the absence * *  * * of the relation ( [ v ] ) , such framework does not hold anymore , and the corresponding bps monopoles can not be achieved .",
    "the usual results are trivially recovered by setting @xmath36 . in order to show how this generalized framework works , we adopt the following generalization function : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some real number ; here , @xmath39 leads us back to the canonical model .",
    "now , given ( [ nw ] ) , the self - dual expressions ( bps1 ) and ( [ bps2 ] ) become@xmath40@xmath41 which must be solved respecting the conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) .",
    "in the next section , we solve the first order equations ( [ nbps1 ] ) and ( [ nbps2 ] ) by means of the relaxation technique for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "then , we plot not only the numerical results for @xmath19 and @xmath23 , but also those for the bps energy density ( buc ) , and for @xmath42 ( the integrand of ( [ te ] ) ) .",
    "we also comment on the main features of the new solutions .",
    "now , we focus our attention on the examination of the profiles of the generalized bps  solutions . thus , we numerically solve the first - order equations ( [ nbps1 ] ) and ( [ nbps2 ] ) obeying the finite energy boundary conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) . here , for simplicity , we choose @xmath43 , and consider only the lower sign in  ( [ cc2 ] ) , ( [ buc ] ) , ( nbps1 ) and ( [ nbps2 ] ) .",
    "then , we numerically solve the self - dual system by means of the relaxation technique , for different values of the real parameter @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath44 leads us back to the usual model , whose self - dual solutions ( already written according our conventions ) can be attained analytically as@xmath45@xmath46the numerical solutions we found for @xmath47  and @xmath48  are depicted  in figs . 1 and 2",

    "the usual ( analytical ) profiles are also shown ( solid black line ) , for comparison .",
    "moreover , we also plot the corresponding solutions for the bps energy density ( [ buc ] ) and for @xmath53 ( the integrand of ( [ te ] ) )  in figs . 3 and 4 .     for @xmath54 ( dot - dashed green line ) ,",

    ", we clearly see that the nonstandard solutions turn out depicted around the usual counterpart , behaving in the same general way , but changing the width of the defect .",
    "we point out that different solutions engender different characteristic lengths .",
    "in particular , the solutions arising for @xmath59 reach the asymptotic condition @xmath60 slower than the standard profile . in this sense , these solutions possess a greater characteristic length , so that the corresponding bosons mediate long - ranged interactions . on the other hand , the solutions related to @xmath61 reach the saturation region faster , exhibiting smaller characteristic lengths , which is associated with small - ranged interactions .    .",

    "2 , we plot the solutions for @xmath23 . again",
    ", the nonstandard solutions behave as the canonical one ,  exhibiting variations concerned with the defect width and the characteristic length .",
    "such variations are controlled by the real parameter @xmath2 in the same way as before : for @xmath59 , the nonusual solutions engender the greater characteristic lengths , since they reach the asymptotic condition @xmath62 more slowly , being associated with long - ranged mediating bosons .",
    "furthermore , for and increasing positive @xmath2 * * , * * the solutions reach the saturation region faster , exhibiting smaller and smaller characteristic lengths , with the mediating bosons yielding small - ranged interactions .",
    "the numerical profiles found for the bps energy density @xmath63 ( [ buc ] ) are depicted in  fig .",
    "3 ,  revealing that such solutions are lumps centered at @xmath64 .",
    "also , they vanish monotonically as @xmath65 goes to @xmath66 ( in fact , @xmath67 arises in a rather natural way from the asymptotic boundary conditions ( [ cc2 ] ) ) . here , the parameter @xmath2 plays a different role , since it changes not only the characteristic lengths of the corresponding solutions , but also their amplitudes . in this sense",
    ", the solutions corresponding to @xmath59  @xmath68  achieve the smaller ( larger ) amplitudes .    .",
    "convention as in fig .",

    "4 . in this case , the solutions are rings centered at @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , the points of larger amplitudes are located at some finite distance @xmath70 from the origin ( in this sense , @xmath70 stands for the `` radius '' of the ring ) , such amplitudes being controlled by @xmath38 in the same way as before . here , we point out the existence of an interesting compensatory effect : the solutions reaching the greater amplitudes spread over smaller distances , and vice - versa . as a consequence ,",
    "different solutions enclose the same area ( equal to the unity , according our conventions ) , and the corresponding configurations achieve the same total energy ; see ( [ te ] ) .",
    "in this work , we have presented a nonstandard first - order framework consistent with a generalized yang - mills - higgs model ( [ 1 ] ) , such model being controlled by two dimensionless functions , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which change the dynamics of the non - abelian fields in a non - usual way . in order to avoid problems with the energy of the system ,",
    "these functions are supposed to be positive .",
    "we point out that the self - duality of the overall model only holds when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related to each other by a simple constraint ; see ( v ) . also , it is worthwhile to note that there is no additional constraint to be imposed on @xmath5 .",
    "the generalized first - order framework was developed in a general way .",
    "so , in order to verify the consistency of our construction , we have introduced an explicit example controlled by a single real parameter @xmath73 ; see ( [ nw ] ) . then",
