    "however , when interested in the influence of the field on the overall dynamical evolution of the halo gas , it is most important to understand how saturation occurs on larger scales . to address this problem",
    ", we also considered the transport of magnetic energy from the viscous scale to the jeans scale . +",
    "starting with a weak magnetic seed field of @xmath0 g , as can be produced by the biermann battery , we follow the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations on the viscous scale and found that they are amplified very rapidly on timescales much shorter than the free - fall time . as a consequence ,",
    "the field saturates almost immediately after the onset of gravitational collapse in the halo . by extrapolating the small - scale magnetic field to larger scales and assuming the peak of the magnetic spectrum shifts on the local eddy timescale",
    ", we were able to follow the evolution of the magnetic field strength throughout the full inertial range within the jeans volume .",
    "for typical halo parameters , the dynamo growth of the magnetic energy saturates at a density of roughly @xmath154 for kolmogorov turbulence and @xmath155 for burgers turbulence . at this point in time",
    "the field has a strength of about @xmath145 g. we point out , however , that the field continues to grow in the collapsing gas due to gravitational compression .",
    "+ our results show that the magnetic energy on small scales , and more importantly also on dynamically important large scales , can grow to very high values . in order to understand the influence of this strong field on the evolution of the halo gas ,",
    "it is important to know whether the small - scale magnetic field can be transformed into a coherent large - scale field .",
    "one way to produce more coherent magnetic structures is by forming disks , which is suggested by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the saturation behavior of the small - scale dynamo should be explored further in the regime @xmath156 , as we have shown that the magnetic prandtl number is in this regime for high densities .",
    "+ if indeed the processes discussed here can produce dynamically significant fields on large scales , then the magnetic field will influence the star formation process in high - redshift halos . for example , since recent high - resolution simulations indicate that the accretion disks around the very first stars were strongly susceptible to fragmentation @xcite it is expected that most primordial stars formed as members of binary or higher - order multiple systems with a wide range of masses rather than being isolated , high - mass stars . from studies of low - mass star formation at present day , however , we know that magnetic fields close to the equipartition value can effectively redistribute angular momentum via a process called magnetic braking @xcite and can thereby reduce the fragmentation probability in the disk @xcite .",
    "the correct treatment of magnetic fields in calculations of primordial star formation therefore seems critical to better understand the mass function and multiplicity of metal - free stars .",
