    "up to now the evidences of the existence of dark matter ( dm ) only come from the gravitational effects . in the early 1950s",
    ", people noticed the anomaly in the rotational velocity in the milky way and other spiral galaxies , and one logical reason is that there are non - luminous matters suffusing our universe .",
    "currently the planck satellite @xcite pinned down that 26.8% of our universe is made up of dm . the bullet cluster and n - body simulations",
    "may reveal some self - interaction of dm particles .    from the particle physicists point of view , the dm particle might have interactions with the standard model ( sm ) particles , that will lead to interesting phenomenology .",
    "the dm direct detection experiments , like xenon100@xcite , cdms ii@xcite etc .",
    ", can probe the interactions between the dm and nucleon . searching for the dm signal as missing energies",
    "have been performed at collider experiments such as atlas @xcite and cms @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on dm indirect detection .",
    "since the dm suffuses our galaxy , they probably annihilate with each other into sm particles . in this case , the antimatters , like positrons or antiprotons , would be the ideal signals for searching for these processes , because the generation of antimatters is rare from ordinary astrophysical processes .",
    "the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) is a particle detector , which was designed to search for the antimatter and determine the composition and flux of the cosmic ray .",
    "the ams-02 published the measurements of electron and positron results with unprecedented statistics in 2014 .",
    "their results confirmed the positron excess with energy higher than 10 gev up to 500 gev , which was first indicated by the pamela on 2008  @xcite . on the contrary , based on pamela and most recent ams-02  @xcite observation",
    "there is no significant excess of antiproton in the cosmic rays from the prediction of conventional astrophysical processes .",
    "the dm annihilation is one of the viable interpretations for the observed positron excess , however it depends on which kinds of the sm particles that the dm particles annihilate into .",
    "the antiproton signal in general co - exists with the positron signal as parts of the annihilation products , that is severely constrained by the exisiting antiproton observations .",
    "this is one of the main difficulties in explaining the positron excess by dm annihilation .",
    "furthermore , the newly released @xmath0 data from ams-02 has so high statistics that it may be used to distinguish various dm annihilation channels . in this work",
    ", we set up a model - independent dm annihilation framework , in which the dm could annihilate into lepton channels ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , quark channels ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , and massive gauge boson channels ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for a single annihilation with varying branching ratios ( br ) . through fitting to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data ,",
    "we investigate if this dm scenario can survive , if it does , which one is the preferred channel . here",
    "we use the @xmath8 channel to represents other lighter quark channels , because with dm mass above few hundreds gev , the positron and anitproton spectra from @xmath8 channel are similar to those spectra from other lighter quark channels .",
    "note that ams-02 very recently released the preliminary data on the ratio @xmath11 @xcite , which also seems to have an unexpected rise at the first glance .",
    "however , it was shown to be consistent with the astrophysical background and conventional diffusion model within uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we will include the most recent ams-02 @xmath11 data in our analysis .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly describe the ams-02 @xmath0 data and background models in the next section and dm model in sec.iii .",
    "the fitting results of @xmath0 data shall be shown in sec.iv . in sec.v , we start considering the constraint from ams-02 @xmath1 data . in sec.vi , we discuss the influences from density profiles .",
    "then we conclude in sec.vii .",
    "in september 2014 , the ams collaboration published their high statistics measurement of the @xmath0 in primary cosmic rays of 0.5 - 500 gev  @xcite . the @xmath0 increases and exceeds the astrophysical cosmic ray expectation for energy larger than about 10 gev .",
    "this trait is consistent with the earlier observations by pamela  @xcite and fermi - lat@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ams-02 provides the most precise measurement so far such that it offers more information and tighter constraints on the origin of positron excess .",
    "the uncertainty of the high energy cosmic positron flux , which is originated from astrophysical sources and presumingly generated from the collision of high energy proton and interstellar medium ( here we denote as the background ) , is still large .",
    "it is due to lack of knowledge of the sources and propagation models for the positron flux .",
    "the proton flux has been precisely measured by many experiments in the past and the most recently by ams-02 .",
    "the secondary electron and positron flux could be calculated straight - forwardly from the interactions of proton with interstellar material ( mostly hydrogen and helium ) . however , there are large uncertainties in the propagation of the secondary particles from the origin of production to the top of atmosphere ( toa ) .",
    "difference diffusion models will give different positron spectra and as well as astrophysical background of @xmath0 when we deal with the ams-02 positron fraction data .",
    "in this work , we will consider four different diffusion models , namely min , med , max  @xcite , and a diffusion convection model ( dc )  @xcite .",
    "each diffusion model is paired with a background , which is obtained by using the method mentioned above and computed through the galprop package  @xcite , and these backgrounds were shown in fig.[bkgd ] .",
    "more description and the parameters for these models will be given in the next section . in fig .",
    "[ bkgd ] , we compare the four backgrounds of @xmath0 from the four diffusion models .",
    "the ordering of background values of @xmath0 is min @xmath12 med @xmath12 max , when the energy @xmath13 10 gev . for the dc case , the background is close to that of med case but has a slight deficit , when @xmath13 100 gev .",
    "the backgrounds of @xmath0 from min , med , and max diffusion models are quite different from one another , in such a way that we anticipate that they are able to cover or represent larger portions of diffusion models in the market . also , they are able to test whether our results are diffusion - model independent .",
    "the reason we adopt the dc diffusion model is that it utilized the more present b / c data to constrain the cosmic - ray propagation parameters .",
    "the ams-02  @xcite provides a very precise measurement of the positron fraction , such that it could discriminate different dm annihilation channels and determine which one is preferred or ruled out . in order to do so",
    ", we consider the multi - annihilation channels dm scenario by assuming that the dark matter ( dm ) particles @xmath14 could annihilate into seven standard model ( sm ) channels @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 , and @xmath6 from a single annihilation process .",
    "the branching ratio for each channel can float between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as long as they satisfy the sum rule @xmath18 the relation between the total dm annihilation cross section and each channel is specified as @xmath19 these sm particles in the final state will further decay or hadronize into positrons , antiprotons , or gamma - rays , which will be added on to the spectra obtained by the conventional high energy cosmic rays . due to the distinctive spectral shape of these dm annihilation products , we may be able to separate these dm signals from the astrophysical cosmic rays and interpret as an indirect evidence of dm .",
    "in general , the leptonic channels @xmath4 , @xmath15 , and @xmath6 produce a relatively harder positron energy spectrum than the quark channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the positron spectra from massive vector boson channels @xmath9 and @xmath10 sit between the leptonic and quark channels .",
    "we use the interface for model - independent analysis from micromegas  @xcite , where the pythia  @xcite was embedded to generate the positron and antiproton spectra of each dm annihilation channel .",
    "several dm density profiles will be considered in this work , including nfw  @xcite , isothermal  @xcite , and einasto  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most of the time we focus on the nfw profile .",

    "the positron energy loss rate @xmath36 is dominated by the synchrotron radiation in the galactic magnetic field and by inverse compton scattering on stellar and cmb photons .",

    "( [ sum ] ) , therefore , overall we have 8 free parameters .    first , we fix the dm density to the nfw profile and use various diffusion models ( min , med , max , and dc ) to compute the positron flux at toa from dm annihilation .",
    "the positron source term of dm annihilation channels can be described by eq .",

    "then we feed the source term into the diffusion equation ( [ diffusion ] ) , and it is solved numerically by the micromegas .",
    "finally , we stack the dm - produced electron and positron flux on top of each diffusion - corresponding background flux to obtain the values of @xmath0 .",

    "independent of the diffusion models , they show the narrow window in @xmath55 restricted by ams-02 @xmath0 data for each value of @xmath47 , despite of the variation of seven annihilation channels .",
    "also , the total annihilation cross section @xmath60 strongly correlates with and is roughly proportional to the @xmath47 , but it is much larger than the thermal dm cross section , which is about @xmath61 .    in the panel of ( @xmath47 , br ) in each of the figs .",

    "it manifests itself in the ( @xmath47 , br ) panel that once the dm mass is below 300 gev , the @xmath51-value is always less than @xmath63 , independent of the diffusion models , and no matter how the combination of the annihilation channels changes . in other words , we can rule out the dm mass below 300 gev as an explanation for the ams-02 @xmath0 excess at @xmath64 cl .",
    "this is because the last two ams-02 @xmath0 data points with the highest energy between 260 gev to 500 gev can not be explained by dm annihilation for the dm mass below 300 gev , due to the cliff shape of the positron energy spectrum from dm annihilation around @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , the upper limit for the dm mass , which are diffusion model dependent , are 5.5 , 60 , 50 , and 13 tev for max , med , min , and dc , respectively .",

    "when the dm mass is below 10 tev , the leptonic channels dominate the branching ratio ( @xmath68 ) , except for the region of @xmath69 1 tev in the max diffusion model , where the quark channels are able to compete with leptonic channels . nonetheless , among these four diffusion models , the quark and gauge - boson channels still play non - negligible roles because ( @xmath70 ) . since @xmath71 @xmath72 , even @xmath73 of the @xmath74 , and @xmath8 channels would generate enormous antiproton flux , and that is why it is severely constrained by the antiproton data  @xcite .",

    "another feature is that once the dm mass goes above 30 tev , the @xmath7 channel becomes more and more important and eventually becomes the major channel , because of the energy spectrum of @xmath7 is relatively softer than the other channels .    in the following ,",
    "we consider how the ams-02 @xmath0 data can distinguish among different channels .",

    "the solid lines represent the single - annihilation channel scenario , while the dashed line shows the chi - square minimum of multi - annihilation channel scenario .",
    "we could see that the dm with multi - annihilation channel scenario can reduce the @xmath50 significantly , although more parameters are involved .",
    "when the dm mass is less than 1 tev , the @xmath6 single - annihilation channel scenario can provide a relatively smaller value of @xmath50 than the other channels , and the minimum @xmath50 occurs at around @xmath75650 , 800 , 500 , and 450 gev for max , med , min , and dc diffusion models , respectively .",
    "the two massive vector - boson channels attain their @xmath50 minimum at about @xmath76 , 10 , 10 , and 5 tev for max , med , min , and dc diffusion models , respectively , because they generate moderate positron energy spectra in between the leptonic and quark channels .",
    "the @xmath7 channel , on the other hand , generates a further softer positron energy spectrum , such that the @xmath50 minimum occurs at around @xmath77 , 40 , 35 , and 20 tev , for the max , med , min , and dc diffusion models , respectively .",
    "once @xmath78 tev , the curve of @xmath7 is in unison with the blue - dash curve , and the @xmath7 channel takes the full responsibility for fitting the data , and other channels become irrelevant . from these results",
    ", we can see that the lepton channels are well separated from quark and massive gauge boson channels , and therefore we anticipate that the ams-02 @xmath0 data is able to distinguish the leptonic channels from the other channels in the dm multi - annihilation channel scenario .",
    "however , the @xmath50 minima of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are almost overlapping , hence it is hard to distinguish them from each other . in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ nfw_min ] , with 300 gev @xmath79 450 gev , pure leptonic channels are solutions of ams-02 positron fraction data under min diffusion model and nfw profile . for min diffusion model in fig .",

    "however , the @xmath81 is the largest from the panel of ( @xmath47 , br ) .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath4 channel almost decouples at this dm mass region , and so the positron spectrum from it is way above the energy scale of ams-02 @xmath0 data , such that dramatically change of @xmath82 does not influence the fitting too much .",
    "therefore , the @xmath80 and @xmath10 channels are still the major channels to fit the data around @xmath75 12 tev .",
    "the panel of ( @xmath83 , p ) in fig .",
    "[ nfw_med ] shows how many percentages of the leptonic channels are required to fit to the ams-02 @xmath0 data with the corresponding @xmath47 in the dm multi - annihilation scenario , while marginalizing all the massive gauge boson ( @xmath84 ) and quark ( @xmath85 ) channels .",

    "two inferences we can draw from here for @xmath47= 1000 gev : ( i ) the major channels are the leptonic , and ( ii ) the three lepton channels alone , @xmath88 , could not fit well to the data . instead , they need help from softer positron spectra of quarks or gauge bosons . when @xmath69 10 tev , the three leptonic channels dominate . on the other hand , for @xmath89 10 tev",

    "the ams-02 @xmath0 data constrain more severely on the branching ratio of leptonic channels for @xmath69 10 tev . in fig .",
    "[ br_all ] , we would like to demonstrate how different background of @xmath0 originating from different diffusion models will modify the conclusions that we made in previous paragraph .",
    "for all three diffusion models max , med , and min at @xmath91 1 tev , the values of @xmath83 are still confined in a narrower window with about @xmath92 deviation at 95% cl from the best - fit value of @xmath83 . on the other hand , for @xmath89 10 tev the confinement is much loose such that the values of @xmath83 can go down to zero in med and min cases .",
    "another feature we can see from this figure is that in the min ( max ) diffusion model , the values of @xmath83 concentrate at slightly larger ( smaller ) values than those of the med model .",

    "the values of @xmath97 for the min diffusion model are about two orders of magnitude larger than the other models , mainly because of the fact that the diffusion zone of min is thinner than the other diffusion models such that particles are easier to escape the diffusion zone during propagation .",

    "the two major differences between the einasto and nfw profiles are ( i ) the former makes the positron spectra from dm annihilation softer than the latter , and ( ii ) in order to produce the same amount of positron or antiproton flux from dm annihilation , a slightly smaller annihilation cross section is required in the einasto profile .",
    "in this work , we have postulated a dm scenario with multi - annihilation channels to account for the positron fraction excess and antiproton - to - proton ratio observed in cosmic rays . by using the most updated @xmath0 and @xmath1 data from ams-02",
    ", we have performed a comprehensive analysis to determine the preferred dm annihilation channel in terms of statistic quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51-values .",
    "we have considered the dm annihilation into @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 , and @xmath6 channels from a single annihilation process , and taken the branching ratio of each channel and the total cross section as the fitting parameters .",
    "we focus on two aspects : i ) which channel is preferred by the ams-02 @xmath0 data , and how strong the confinement of branching ratios can be implied .",
    "ii ) under this multi - annihilation channel dm scenario , we are looking for a simultaneous solution for both ams-02 @xmath0 data and @xmath1 data . several diffusion models ( max , med ,",
    "min , and dc ) and dm density profiles ( isothermal , nfw , einasto ) are invstigated in our analysis . uncertainties in astrophysical backgrounds are obtained via combinations of various density profiles and diffusion models .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   the allowed region of dm mass @xmath47 and annihilation cross sections @xmath55 that can provide good fits with @xmath51-value @xmath118 0.05 to the ams-02 @xmath0 data is very broad .",
    "the range of @xmath47 extends from 300 gev to a few tens of tev , and @xmath55 extends from @xmath119 pb to @xmath120 pb . however , there is strong and almost linear correlation between the @xmath47 and @xmath55 .",
    "the dm mass below 300 gev is ruled out at 95% cl by the @xmath0 data , and this lower limit of @xmath47 is diffusion - model and density - profile independent . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit for the dm mass strongly depends on the diffusion models and density profiles .",
    "pure leptonic channels are solutions of ams-02 positron fraction data under combination of nfw - min with @xmath121 [ 300 , 450 ] gev or combination of einasto - dc with @xmath121 [ 300 , 1800 ] gev .",
    "3 .   the high statistical measurement from ams-02 has the capacity to distinguish among different annihilation channels .",
    "for a few hundred gev to several tev dm , the @xmath122 channel is the ideal one to fit to the @xmath0 data . on the other hand , for several tev to 10 tev dm , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the favorites . beyond 10 tev",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath7 channels begin to take over and completely dominate very quickly .",
    "4 .   based on the multi - annihilation channel dm scenario , for all max , med , and min diffusion models ,",
    "when @xmath91 1 tev , the ams-02 @xmath0 data has the best confinement of the branching ratio of the sum of three leptonic channels , and @xmath83 is within @xmath92 deviation from the best - fit value at 95% cl .",
    "however , the value of @xmath83 for the best - fit point depends on the diffusion model .",
    "the dm scenario with multi annihilation channels under the combinations of the max , med and dc diffusion models , and the nfw density profile can not satisfy both ams-02 @xmath0 and @xmath1 data at 95% cl .",
