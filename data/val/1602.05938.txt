    "neutron interferometry is one of the most precise techniques used to test the postulates of quantum mechanics , and it is also one of the most important and precise techniques used to measure low - energy neutron cross sections @xcite .",
    "although the fundamentals of neutron interferometry are easily recognizable from common optics , the slow velocity of neutrons ( 1680 @xmath0 for the 2.35 @xmath1 neutrons used in this study ) and low count rates at the detector ( @xmath2 ) demand novel solutions .",
    "the most important of these was the development of multiblade , single - crystal interferometery which enables high contrast to be observed with only limited beam alignment @xcite .",
    "the challenge remains however of making the experiment robust against mechanical vibrations @xcite .",
    "a typical single - crystal interferometer has path lengths of 10 @xmath3 with a typical 50 @xmath4 travel time of neutrons in the system .",
    "small - amplitude low - frequency vibrations may significantly degrade the contrast . here",
    "we propose a solution to robust interferometry based on a four - blade single - crystal geometry that reduces errors introduced by vibrations .",

    "[ fig:4bl_sch ]  * b * ) that is less sensitive to low - frequency vibrations .     * a * : a schematic diagram of the three - blade neutron interferometer .",
    "a neutron beam ( with neutron velocity @xmath5 ) comes from the left , is split by the first blade , is diffracted on the second blade , and recombines at the third . after passing through the interferometer",
    ", the beam is captured by the o- and h - detectors .",
    "we model vibrations as oscillations of and around the center of mass of the interferometer , as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 could be @xmath8 ( transverse vibrations ) , @xmath9 ( longitudinal vibrtions ) , and @xmath10 ( rotational vibrations ) . in order to compare oscillations between the three- and four - blades devices the distance between the blades",
    "is set equal to @xmath11 . * b * : a schematic diagram of the proposed interferometer with four blades .",
    "instead of one diffracting blade here we have two , which reverses the neutron paths in order to compensate for vibrations .",
    "we will compare the performance using the same vibration modes with the same amplitudes .",
    "note that for the three - blade interferometer the o - detector has the maximum contrast and in the four - blade interferometer the h - detector has the maximum contrast.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in the three - blade case the neutron beam , coming from the left , is coherently split into two paths by the first blade via bragg scattering . after being reflected by the second blade",
    ", these two paths are recombined at the third blade .",
    "the resultant interference is observed at the o- and h - detectors .",
    "note that we align the @xmath8 coordinate parallel to the bragg planes and the @xmath9 coordinate is perpendicular to the bragg planes . in the four - blade case",
    "the situation is nearly identical with the significant difference that the paths are reflected and cross each other without mixing at the center of the interferometer , i.e. without a blade there is no mixing of the states .",
    "it is sufficient to take a simple model for noise and to consider vibrations as sinusoidal oscillations around the center of mass of the single crystal , which we write as @xmath12 for @xmath7 we can specify any coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 , or any angles ( such as @xmath10 - rotation around z axis ) . in order to motivate the discussion we adopt a simple model for the neutron - blade interaction that includes all of the necessary physics .",
    "the interaction is that of bouncing of a small particle ( neutron ) from a moving heavy wall ( the blade ) where the particle is reflected . when the particle is transmitted there is no interaction ( figure  [ fig : inter_sch ] ) .",
    "we use conservation of momentum and energy to calculate the neutron s change in velocity after bouncing .",
    "we require a small enough amplitude and low enough oscillation frequency that the modified momentum of the neutron still satisfies the bragg condition .",
    "vibrations thus modify the neutron velocities and change the path length of the neutron inside the interferometer @xcite .     a schematic diagram of the neutron scattering from a blade of the neutron interferometer .",
    "due to the crystal movement , the reflected neutron s momentum is modified .",
    "for the transmitted case , the momentum remains unaltered.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    using these approximations , it is clear that vibrations along every axis except the @xmath13 coordinate will reduce the interferometer contrast .",
    "the @xmath13-component of neutron velocity is zero and the paths lengths are independent of crystal vibration along the @xmath13 axis at this level of approximation .",
    "we first consider vibrations along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "the measure of the quality of the interferometer is it s contrast , so we calculate and plot the contrast versus the frequency of oscillations .",
    "the four - blade version returns higher contrast by compensating with the third blade for momentum change introduced by vibration of the second blade .",
    "we expect this compensation to be most precise for low - frequency vibrations .",
    "assume that the neutron hits the first blade of interferometer at the time @xmath14 .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : oscil ] for vibrations along the @xmath8 axis where @xmath15 is a random phase between the arriving neutron and the vibrating blade . @xmath16",
    "the velocity of the interferometer at the time @xmath17 is @xmath18 at time @xmath14 , the velocity of the interferometer along the @xmath8-coordinate is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is random .",
    "conservation of momentum and energy at the moment @xmath14 implies that the velocity of the transmitted neutron does not change , while the reflected neutron s velocities are @xmath21 .",
    "the phase difference for the neutron between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum of the neutron and @xmath26 is the path - length vector along which the neutron is moving .    for the neutron to travel between the first two blades",
    "takes a time @xmath27 .",
    "the contrast depends on the total phase difference between the paths .",
    "notice that under these assumptions the two paths cross the third blade at the same spot and the travel time along these paths remains @xmath28 .",
    "so , the loss in contrast seen in the presence of vibration is not due to the finite coherence length of the interferometer but rather is due to the extra phase shifts introduced by the vibrations .    using these",
    "we find @xmath29 if we assume that @xmath30 is slowly varying on the scale of @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) we can approximate the expression @xmath33 as a derivative of @xmath30 @xmath34    the intensity at the o - detector is @xmath35 and depends on the random phase @xmath20 .",

    "this is the source of the protection against vibrations .",

    "the intensity at the h - detector is @xmath48 and depends on the random phase @xmath20 of vibration .",

    "[ fig : vib ]  * a * we clearly see that the four - blade interferometer is predicted to be much less sensitive to @xmath8 vibrations .",
    "in the case of vibrations along the @xmath9 axis the momentum of the neutron is not modified ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : inter_sch ] ) . however the path length changes depending on the phase @xmath20 of the oscillations at @xmath14 .    here",
    "the contrast is primarily limited by the neutron coherence length of @xmath52 .",
    "the four - blade geometry does not protect against this and indeed the influence of a finite coherence length is slightly worse due to the noise being introduced since the intervals between blades are changed by the vibrations . in the three - blade case",
    "there are two such intervals , while in the four - blade case there are three .",
    "so with finite @xmath53 the more blades there are , the worse the noise is .",

    "the vibrations along the @xmath9 axis are @xmath55 in this case the phase shift is due to the paths crossing at a point displaced from ideal as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dx_df_sch ] .",

    ".    figure  [ fig : vib ]  * b * shows the contrast dependence on the frequency of vibrations along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "this should be viewed as an upper bound on the predicted contrast .",
    "the message is that vibrations along @xmath9 axis are not very important and even though the four - blade design is somewhat more sensitive to them than is the three - blade design . in the final analysis",
    "the four - blade design is predicted to have better overall performance .",
    "these vibrations are expected to be most limiting since the neutron interferometer has such a small acceptance angle . in the case of rotational vibrations , we rewrite the oscillation in terms of the angle @xmath10 around the @xmath13 axis @xmath65 for small angles , rotational vibrations can be considered as translational vibrations , i.e. @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the distance from the blade to the center of rotation .      in the three - blade interferometer ,",

    "our model reconstructs the situation that is normally seen in neutron interferometry .",
    "vibrations we use in our simulations ( with amplitude @xmath83 m in translation ) produce changes in the incident angle of the neutron of much less than the acceptance angle of the crystal ( @xmath84rad ) and of a similar order for the 50hz frequency range previously measured  @xcite . in order to exceed the acceptance angle",
