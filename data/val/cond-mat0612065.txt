    "there is great scientific and commercial interest in the development of quantum computation ( qc ) and the creation of computational devices based on the principles of quantum logic .",
    "several different schemes for qc have been proposed to date ( see , for example , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "one of the exciting avenues , potentially compatible with the vast fabrication capabilities of modern semiconductor technology , relies on the encoding of information in the electron or nuclear spins present in semiconductor nanostructures , leading to a spin - based semiconductor quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the most developed model of the nuclear spin quantum computer is the kane suggestion @xcite to use a precisely located array of phosphorous donors introduced into si . in this proposal ,",
    "the nuclear spin @xmath2 of @xmath0p is used as a qubit , while a donor electron together with an overlying gate ( a - gate ) separated from the donor by a sio@xmath3 or si@xmath4ge@xmath5 barrier , provides single - qubit operation using an external magnetic field and pulses of radio - frequency radiation .",
    "the interqubit coupling is determined by the overlap of the electron wave functions and is controlled by metallic gates ( j - gates ) midway between the a - gates .",
    "the overlap of wave functions of localized electrons in si drops very rapidly with distance @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radius of localization ( for p in si , @xmath9  nm ) , therefore the interqubit distance @xmath6 between p atoms must be small ( less than 20  nm ) to allow overlap .    experimental realization of the suggested model presents a number of difficulties .",
    "we focus here on two problems : ( 1 ) placing single p donors into the si substrate at a precise depth underneath the barrier and ( 2 ) the necessity to increase significantly the interqubit distance @xmath6 to have room enough to arrange the metallic gates .",
    "this means that mechanisms other than the direct overlap of the electron wave functions have to be chosen for the coupling of adjacent nuclear spin qubits .    to solve these problems",
    ", we suggest the novel technology based on epitaxial growth of si and sige layers from isotopically engineered si and ge sources followed by neutron - transmutation doping of the grown structures .",
    "we also describe the mechanism of indirect interqubit coupling based on the arrangement of qubits in a mesoscopic quasi - one - dimensional wire .",
    "this mechanism allows one to control the coupling between qubits separated by large distances @xmath6 ( 200  nm or even more ) , which permits the fabrication of metallic gates by means of the modern lithography .",
    "moreover , the suggested mechanism of indirect coupling allows entanglement passing over non - qubit nodes in an array of qubits .",
    "we also present the numerical estimates which justify the feasibility of the proposed device and method of operation .",
    "two methods had prevoiusly been suggested for the precise placing of p atoms into si ( for a review , see ref .   and references therein ) . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a  bottom - up ",
    "method is described for incorporation of phosphorus - bearing molecules ph@xmath10 on a preliminary h passivated si ( 001 ) surface during the molecular - beam - epitaxial growth followed by the decomposition of ph@xmath10 at significantly increased temperature .",
    "the alternative  top - down  method is based on incorporation of dopant atoms under the surface of the grown structure using ion implantation , followed by the annealing of radiation damage @xcite at increased temperatures . in these methods",
    ", the depth distribution of the incorporated donor atoms can not be controlled to the necessary accuracy .",
    "for example , in the  bottom - up ",
    "method , incorporation of impurities of different chemical nature is disadvantageous both for the quality of the growing structure and for the sharpness of the vertical distribution of impurities because of the  floating - up  effect in the process of subsequent growth . in",
    "the  top - down ",
    "method , the distribution of impurities in  as - implanted  samples is determined by the energy of ions , and initially is not sharp . moreover , during the annealing of radiation damage , impurities are redistributed towards the si / sige interface which acts as a getter . as a result ,",
    "the vertical distribution of the implanted impurities is rather extended .",
    "meanwhile , small fluctuations in the vertical position of p atoms under the gate is very important to minimize the a - gate voltage error rate @xcite because otherwise , each qubit would need its own set of applied voltages and each interacting pair of qubits would need its unique pulse time @xcite .",
    "we suggest here a novel technology of the precise placing of p atoms into si layer .",
    "the key point is the growth of the central si and barrier si@xmath4ge@xmath5 layers from different isotopes : the si@xmath4ge@xmath5 layers from isotopes @xmath1si and @xmath11ge and the central si layer from isotope @xmath1si with @xmath12si spots introduced by means of the nano - lithography ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the formation of quasi - one - dimensional si wires will be achieved in a subsequent operation by the etching of si layer between wires and the filling of the resulting gaps by the si@xmath4ge@xmath13 barrier composed from isotopes @xmath1si and @xmath11ge . because different isotopes of si and ge are chemically identical , this technology guarantees the high quality of the grown structures .",
    "after preparation , these structures will be irradiated with a neutron flux in a nuclear reactor followed by the fast annealing of radiation damage .",
    "the behaviour of different isotopes is different .",
    "after capture of a slow ( thermal ) neutron , a given isotope shifts to the isotope with mass number larger by one .",
    "if the isotope thus obtained is stable , this nuclear reaction does not entail doping . however , if the obtained isotope is unstable , it transmutes after half - life time @xmath14 to a nucleus of another element with atomic number larger by one in the case of @xmath15  decay .",
    "this method of doping is called ntd - neutron - transmutation doping @xcite . in the case of si",
    ", ntd is based on the transmutation of the isotope @xmath12si : @xmath16    in the isotopically engineered structure , @xmath0p donor atoms will be produced only within @xmath12si spots , because the isotopes @xmath1si and @xmath17ge shift to the stable isotopes @xmath18si and @xmath19ge , respectively .",
    "therefore , in the suggested method , the processes of the structure growth and doping are completely separated . the idea to fabricate a basic element for a nuclear spin quantum computer using the isotope engineering of si and sige nanostructures",
    "was proposed earlier in @xcite .",
    "the precise placing of p atoms into a si matrix by means of the ntd method was suggested in @xcite .",
    "let us estimate the feasibility of the proposed method .",
    "we consider a @xmath12si spot of area @xmath20  nm @xmath21  @xmath22 , thickness @xmath2310  nm with a distance of 200  nm between spots ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the  buried  distance to the structure surface is halved , 100 nm , which is needed to protect against cross - links and to ensure the influence of the a - gate voltage on the corresponding underlying qubit only . in the proposed method of incorporation of p into si",
    ", the vertical accuracy of the location of p donors is determined by the thickness of the @xmath12si spot ( 10  nm ) with respect to the distance to the a - gate ( 100  nm ) .",
    "indeed , the irradiation of samples by thermal neutrons occurs at room temperatures where the introduced p atoms are immobile .",
    "the irradiation is followed by the annealing of radiation damage at higher temperatures ( 700@xmath24c ) . during the short annealing time",
    "( 1 hour ) , impurities can not diffuse far from the transmutation place ; the diffusion length does not exceed 12  nm . as a result",
    ", the proposed method will provide an almost equal burying depth of p atoms with a controlled accuracy ( about 10% in our example ) .",
    "the time needed for the irradiation of the grown structures in a nuclear reactor is estimated as follows .",
    "the number of transmutation events is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of atoms , @xmath27 is the cross - section of the thermal neutron capture for given isotope ( @xmath28  @xmath22 ) , @xmath29 is the integral neutron flux ( @xmath30 is the intensity of the thermal neutron flux and @xmath31 is the time of irradiation ) . in a spot with volume @xmath32  nm @xmath33  @xmath34",
    ", there are @xmath35  si atoms ( @xmath36  @xmath37 ) . if the enrichment of si with isotope @xmath12si is close to 100% , @xmath38 .",
    "to achieve @xmath39 , the integral irradiation dose @xmath40 has to equal to @xmath41  neutron/@xmath22 . in some research nuclear reactors ,",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 s@xmath44 , which corresponds to the reasonable irradiation time @xmath45  s @xmath46  hrs .      an unavoidable peculiarity of the ntd is the casual character of the neutron capture . as a consequence , after ntd , some of @xmath12si spots will contain no donor atom ( `` 0-spot '' ) and can not serve therefore as qubits , while some will contain more than one donor atom .",
    "the probability @xmath47 to find `` 0-spot '' , `` 1-spot '' , `` 2-spot '' , and so on @xmath48 , is described by the poisson distribution : @xmath49where @xmath50 is the binomial coefficient , @xmath51 is the probability for the neutron to be captured in a layer of thickness @xmath52 ,  @xmath53 is the dimensionless dose of irradiation .",
    ".,width=302 ]    these probabilities are plotted in fig .",
    "2 as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath54 the best candidates for qubits are `` 1-spots '' , while spots having more than one donor could also be considered as qubits after corresponding theoretical investigation . only spots without donors ( `` 0-spots '' ) are obviously non - qubits . in the ntd method ,",
    "the maximal portion of `` 1-spots '' is 37% at @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the portion of non - qubit is also about 37% .",
    "if `` 2-spots '' are also considered as possible qubits , the optimal integral dose will correspond to @xmath56 in this case , the fraction of non - qubits decreases to @xmath57 14% .    to determine the number of donors in each spot , we propose to use narrow source - drain ( sd ) channels fabricated beneath each donor position ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the given spot contains one donor , it will form ( together with the underlying sd channel and overlying a - gate ) a flash - memory field - effect transistor ( fet ) with the qubit donor acting as a  floating gate  .",
    "the donor electron is separated from the sd channel and a - gate by the si@xmath4ge@xmath5 barriers of about 1020  nm width and 100 mev height @xcite which are used for the electron confinement . however",
    ", a pulse of relatively strong voltage applied between the a - gate and sd channel will tilt the barriers leading to electron transfer and donor ionization .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that if the dopant - gate separation distance is more than 8@xmath58  nm for p in si ( in our case this condition is satisfied because the distance to the gate is about 100 nm ) , the transfer of electron from donor takes place abruptly at a threshold voltage . an electric field of the positively - charged donor ion located only 10 nm from the narrow sd channel will shift the fet cutoff voltage at the value of about 10 mv , which is easy to observe @xcite .",
    "if there are two or more donors in the given spot , the cutoff shift will be even larger . if there is no donor underneath the given gate , the shift will not be observed .",
    "we believe that the proposed sd channel can also be used for the read - out operation , i.e. for the detection of a single nuclear spin state . the direct control of a nuclear spin state via nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements is a difficult problem . in ref .",
    ", coherent control of the local nuclear spin was demostrated , based on pulsed nmr in a quantum hall device . in ref .",
    ", a self - contained semiconductor device is described that can control nuclear spins in a nano - scale region .",
    "measurements of the electron spin state are much easier taking into account the possibility of a spin - to - charge conversion for electrons . in accordance with the kane model @xcite , the state of the nuclear spin @xmath0p is mediated by the spin of donor electron via the hyperfine interaction .",
    "therefore , the task is to determine the spin orientation of the corresponding donor electron .",
    "the suggested method @xcite is based on the fact that at low temperatures , a donor atom can capture the second electron with small ionization energy , about 1  mev , which results in the appearance of a negatively charged donor ( @xmath59-center ) .",
    "however , this process is possible only when the spin orientation of the second electron is opposite to that of the first electron .",
    "the appearance of the charged donor in the vicinity of the narrow sd channel will affect the current @xcite and can therefore be detected . as a result , one can determine the spin orientation of two neighboring donor electrons if one applies a potential difference between the corresponding a - gates which will cause the electron to jump from one donor to another .",
    "if we choose the spin orientation of the given donor as a reference , one can determine the spin state of the neighboring qubits on the right and left sides .",
    "the proposed sd channels have a twofold purpose : the determination of the number of donors within each spot ( qubit certification ) and the determination of the spin state of the donor electron ( read - out operation ) .",
    "we suggest a method for the fabrication and the proper alignment of the sd channels with respect to the position of @xmath0p qubits .",
    "this method is also based on isotope engineering of a si@xmath60ge@xmath61 layer followed by ntd .",
    "we propose to make the underlying si@xmath60ge@xmath61 layer from a composition close to pure ge ( say , si@xmath62ge@xmath63 ) using isotopes @xmath1si and @xmath11ge , followed by the fabrication of 30 nm - width strips where @xmath11ge is replaced by @xmath64ge ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "after ntd , these @xmath64ge - strips will be doped by as donors through the following nuclear reaction : @xmath65    irradiation of the structure with the thermal neutron integral dose @xmath66",
    "@xmath43 ( @xmath55 ) needed for introducing on average one p donor in each @xmath12si spot , will also lead to doping of @xmath64ge - strips with as donors to a high level ( @xmath67  @xmath68 because of the relatively large @xmath69  @xmath22 .",
    "this concentration of as exceeds the critical value of the metal ",
    "insulator transition for ge : as @xcite .",
    "therefore , ntd - introduced narrow channels will have a metallic - like conductivity and remain conductive down to @xmath70 .",
    "this is important because nano - fet will operate at low temperatures when donor electrons in @xmath0p - qubits are localized on their donors . for the suggested geometry of the sd channel , with the thickness of the si@xmath62ge@xmath63 layer of about 10  nm , width of the @xmath64ge - strips of 30  nm and the length about 1  @xmath71 m , the channel resistance is about 1  m@xmath72 , which is suitable .    in the proposed method of device fabrication ,",
    "the proper alignment of the @xmath64ge - strips with respect to the overlying @xmath0p qubits is provided by the high accuracy of the electron beam - assisted patterning of trenches in @xmath11ge@xmath1si layer with the overlying holes in @xmath1si layer .",
    "taking into account that the size of all components is not less than 3050  nm , one can conclude that the alignment could be realized by the recent progress in sem- and afm - assisted lithography .",
    "electrons in a quantum wire of the length @xmath73.,width=226 ]",
    "in this section , we suggest a new mechanism of entanglement for distant qubits and discuss , first , the principles of two - qubit operation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that two - bit gates applied to a pair of electron or nuclear spins are universal for the verification of all principles of quantum computation .    because direct overlap of wavefunctions for electrons localized on p donors is negligible for distant pairs ,",
    "we propose another principle of coupling based on the placement of qubits at fixed positions in a quasi - one - dimensional si nanowire and using the indirect interaction of @xmath0p nuclear spins with spins of electrons localized in the nanowire which we will call hereafter as  1d - electrons  .",
    "this interaction depends on the amplitude of the wavefunction of the  1d - electron  estimated at the position of the given donor nucleus @xmath74 and can be controlled by the change in the number of  1d - electrons  @xmath75 in the wire@xmath76    at @xmath77 the interqubit coupling is totally suppressed , each @xmath0p nuclear spin interact only with its own donor electron .",
    "this situation is analoguous to that one suggested in the kane proposal @xcite and therefore all single - qubit operations and estimates of the decoherence time are valid also in our case .",
    "the difference consists in the method of coupling when a controlled number @xmath75 of  1d - electronsis injected into the nanowire . in this case , nuclear spin - qubits will also interact with the spins of ",
    "1d - electrons  . to estimate the intensity of this interaction we need to calculate @xmath78 in the below calculation we believe that the donor potential does not influence the distribution function @xmath79 of  1d - electrons ",
    "because it is screened by the donor electron on the relatively short distance of order of @xmath9  nm and @xmath8 is small comared with the wire length @xmath73 .",
    "let the interqubit distance be @xmath80  nm , one order of magnitude larger than in the kane proposal @xcite .",
    "to realize the coupling between these distant qubits , we suggest fabricating a si nanowire of length @xmath81  nm and place p donors at distances @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "for @xmath84 and @xmath85 the functions @xmath86 belong to the energy levels @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) because each level contains two electrons with opposite spin .",
    "the highest amplitude of @xmath86 evaluated at the positions of the nuclear spin qubits @xmath89 and @xmath90 is realized at @xmath91 @xmath92 . in this case , the interqubit coupling is maximal .    to calculate the coefficient of the hyperfine interaction between nuclear and electron spins ,",
    "we consider following @xcite , a system consisting of electrons confined by a potential @xmath93 and two nuclear spins .",
    "we suppose that the nuclear spins are located far enough from each other so that the direct nuclear spin interaction is negligible .",
    "the contact hyperfine interaction between electrons and nuclear spins leads to an indirect nuclear spin interaction .",
    "let the quantum wire have finite length @xmath73 in the @xmath94-direction with the two nuclear spins located at @xmath95 and @xmath96 in a magnetic field @xmath97 directed in the @xmath98 direction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the hamiltonian of the electron in the mesoscopic structure in the magnetic field , @xmath101 is the contact hyperfine interaction , @xmath102 is the electron mass , @xmath103 is the magnetic - field potential , @xmath104 is the bohr magneton , @xmath105 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are nuclear and electron spins , and @xmath108 is radius vector of the nucleus .",
    "the effective nuclear spin interaction energy calculated by second - order perturbation theory is @xcite : @xmath109here , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the electron distribution function in the initial and final states",
    ". we will use expression ( [ eff_en ] ) to find the effective interaction between nuclear spins .",
    "we suppose that the transverse dimensions of the quantum wire are much smaller than its length and the cyclotron orbit of the electron .",
    "the confining potential is @xmath114 , where @xmath115 if @xmath116 , and @xmath117 otherwise .",
    "the wave function should satisfy the following boundary condition : @xmath118 .",
    "the solution has the form @xmath119",
    "@xmath120where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the transverse dimensions of the electron wave function .",
    "let us consider the problem at @xmath123 . in this case",
    "the electron distribution function @xmath124 is 1 for the filled states and 0 for the empty states . inserting this wave function into eq .",
    "( [ eff_en ] ) and assuming that the zeeman splitting energy in ( [ enlevel ] ) is much less than the energy gap between levels with different @xmath125 , one obtains the following expression for the nuclear spin interaction constant @xmath126 @xcite : @xmath127 \\sin ^{2}\\left [   \\frac{n+1}{2}\\pi ( r_{2}/l)\\right ] } { g\\mu _ { b}h }   \\label{a}\\ ] ]    it is seen , that at @xmath91 , @xmath126 is maximal for both qubit positions @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "let us estimate the error caused by unavoidable fluctuations in the positions of nuclear spins in the wire . in our device",
    ", the size of @xmath12si - spot is 30 nm .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the position of ntd - introduced p donor will fluctuate around the central point within @xmath128  nm , which is about 1/40 of the total wire length ( 600 nm ) , @xmath129 . in our model ,",
    "the coupling is realized in the case when the wave function of  1d - electron  @xmath130 has the maximal value at places of the qubit location , where the space derivative @xmath131 is close to zero .",
    "this makes the coupling insensitive to the form of distribution function and to small fluctuations in the qubit positions .",
    "thus , the above consideration shows that the indirect coupling is maximal at @xmath85 while at @xmath77 the coupling is totally suppressed .",
    "this means that in our model , the entanglement between two distant qubit can be effectively controlled by the proper variation of @xmath75 .",
    "scalability is the one of the most important requirements of the quantum computer proposals @xcite .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the above method of coupling opens a way to avoid the problem connected with the break in the one - dimensional array of qubits .",
    "this problem is inevitable in all proposed technologies . in the method of coupling based on the direct overlap of electron wave functions",
    "@xcite , this requirement is crucial because any break in the one - dimensional array of qubits stops the entanglement along the array and make quantum computation impossible . in our model , entanglement can exist even in the unlikely case of two or more breaks in the qubit array one after another , because indirect coupling can passing over wrong sites by the proper choice of the nanowire length @xmath73 and the number of electrons @xmath75 in the wire .",
