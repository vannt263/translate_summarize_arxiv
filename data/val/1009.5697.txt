    "the cross sections of photo - nuclear processes , such as ( @xmath1 ) , ( @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath3 ) , ( @xmath4 ) , ( @xmath5 ) , ( @xmath6 ) are key elements in various astrophysical scenarios , like supernovae explosions or @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "precise values of these basic data are also indispensible for simulations of processes of nuclear technology . many of the relevant reactions involve unstable nuclei for which measurements of the cross sections are not possible .",
    "therefore , the cross sections have to be taken from theory . in many cases",
    "the statistical hauser - feshbach model is applicable , which decomposes the total reaction cross section into a product of the absorption and emission probabilities of the particles and @xmath0-quants .",
    "theoretical models that predict the dipole strength function for @xmath0-absorption or emission through the whole nuclear chart are therefore of utter importance .",
    "the reactions take place in an energy interval of a few mev around the particle emission thresholds . aside from the mentioned applications in nuclear astrophysics and nuclear technology ,",
    "the understanding of the mechanisms that determine the structure of the dipole strength function on the low - energy tail of the isovector giant dipole resonance is a challenge of its own to nuclear theory .",
    "the present article proposes and tests a new approach , which we call instantaneous shape sampling ( iss ) .",
    "this approach combines the microscopic quasiparticle random phase approximation for dipole excitations with the phenomenological interacting boson approximation for a dynamical treatment of the nuclear shape .",
    "the iss approach aims at the microscopic description of the dipole strength function of the many transitional nuclei ranging between the regions of spherical and well deformed shapes , which execute large shape fluctuations .",
    "the special focus of our calculations is the behavior of dipole strength in the energy range of few mev around the particle - emission threshold .",
    "these energies are most important for the mentioned applications .",
    "it is also the range where there are great gaps in theoretical and experimental knowledge about the dipole strength function .",
    "iss was suggested in ref .",

    "the absorption cross section enters directly the total cross section for ( @xmath0,_particle _ ) reactions .",
    "for the ( _ particle_,@xmath0 ) reactions , the dipole strength function determines the @xmath0-cascade depopulating excited states .",
    "we present only results for the absorption cross sections , because the strength function can be easily obtained from the absorption cross sections by means of eqs .",
    "( [ sigmae1 ] , [ sigmam1 ] ) .    the @xmath9 part of the absorption cross section dominates in the energy range above 6 mev , where the @xmath20 part amounts to only a few percent of the total cross section ( see sec .  [ qrpa ] ) .",
    "thus , in reviewing previous work we focus on the electric part .",
    "the prominent structure of the cross section @xmath8 is the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "it can be approximated by a lorentzian @xcite @xmath28 and is determined by three parameters , the resonance energy @xmath29 , the maximum height @xmath30 , and the width @xmath31 .",
    "this expression represents the amount of radiation absorbed by a classical damped dipole oscillator , where @xmath32 is the dissipation rate of the vibrational energy which determines the width of the resonance . concerning the low - energy tail ,",
    "the question arises if and in which way @xmath31 depends on the energy .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest @xmath33 based on the theory of fermi liquids , where @xmath34 is the photon energy .",
    "other authors consider the width as constant . for axially deformed nuclei ,",
    "the gdr splits into two peaks @xcite , for triaxial deformation into three peaks , where each of the modes can be described by a lorentzian @xcite .",
    "the different resonance frequencies reflect the different wavelengths along the principal axes of the deformed nucleus @xcite .",
    "the hauser - feshbach codes , used to calculate reaction rates for various applications , like such as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , traditionally employ some version of the two - lorentzian model @xcite .",
    "the deformation parameters of the assumed axial shape are taken either from experimental @xmath35 values or from calculations by means of the micro - macro ( mm ) method @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the experimental absorption cross section was analyzed in terms of a model of three individual lorentzians with relative resonance energies related to the nuclear deformation according to hydrodynamics ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath36 , where @xmath29 is the energy of the resonance .",
    "recently , cross sections in the gdr region were combined with novel photon - scattering data obtained from experiments at the elbe accelerator @xcite , which provided for the first time cross sections from the low - energy region up to the gdr region .",
    "the new data suggest that the smooth lorentzian extrapolation to energies far below the peak region of the gdr provides a rough estimate for the average trend of the cross sections , but is not capable of describing resonance phenomena observed in this energy region .",
    "although the experimental information about the cross section below the particle emission threshold is still sparse there is evidence for pronounced fluctuations and resonance - like structures that are above the lorentzian @xcite .",
    "furthermore , below 5 mev the cross section changes more and more in to a discrete spectrum of individual 1@xmath37 states .",
    "this energy region becomes important in reactions involving neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the dipole strength function that determines the @xmath0-cascade in ( _ particle_,@xmath0 ) reactions may also belong to this energy region if the @xmath38 value is low .",
    "ba calculated in qrpa with the equilibrium deformation @xmath39 ( cf . tab .",
    "[ equilibriumdef ] ) .",
    "solid black curve : width @xmath31 = 3 mev , thin blue curve : width @xmath31 = 0.1 mev.,height=264 ]    a more microscopic approach is needed to account for these shortcomings . moreover , a microscopically founded description of the dipole strength function is a longstanding challenge of its own to nuclear theory .",
    "the traditional approach is to start from the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite , which extends the mean field description of the nucleus by taking into account the quasi - bosonic part of the residual interaction , which generates a coupling between the elementary two - quasiparticle excitations in the selfconsistent mean field potential @xcite .",
    "after the qrpa dispersion relation is solved one obtains a discrete series of states that are superpositions of the two - qpasiparicle excitations .",
    "these states describe how the cross section of the collective dipole vibration is spread over the two - quasiparticle excitations .",
    "this mechanism is called landau fragmentation ( or landau damping in the case of a dense two - quasiparticle spectrum ) .",
    "it accounts for a part of the width of the gdr .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ qrpaspectrum ] , we show the absorption cross section for the axially deformed nucleus @xmath40ba .",
    "the discrete energies of the qrpa solutions are folded with a breit - wigner distribution with a width of @xmath31 = 0.1mev ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sfn ] ) below ) .",
    "the strong fluctuations of the cross section reflect the individual structure of the two - quasiparticle excitations that contribute to the gdr .",
    "the nucleus is prolate .",
    "the two main peaks correspond to the vibrations along the long axis ( @xmath41 , low ) and along the short axis ( @xmath42 = 1 , high ) .",
    "the landau fragmentation generates a cross section @xmath43 at low energy , which , as discussed in the following , is of the order of the observed one",
    ". however , there must be strong additional couplings of the qrpa `` doorway '' states to more complicated excitations , which smooth out the fluctuations completely .    in standard qrpa calculations",
    "these couplings are taken into account in a phenomenological way by folding the qrpa solutions with a breit - wigner or lorentz function analogously to the three solutions of the dipole oscillator just mentioned .",
    "we prefer for simplicity the breit - wigner distribution which is practically equivalent to the lorentz function used in eq .",
    "( [ sigexp ] ) .",
    "the breit - wigner distribution is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cross section of the qrpa solution at the energy @xmath46 .",
    "the cross section takes on the smooth shape seen in experiments , if folded with a large width @xmath31 = 3 mev . in the considered case",
    "the relation @xmath47 holds , and the two peaks merge into a broad peak , the large width of which reflects the deformation .",
    "qrpa calculations for static spherical or deformed shapes ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) use such a smoothing procedure to account phenomenologically for the neglected coupling to more complex configurations .",
    "accordingly , in refs .",
    "@xcite strength functions for applications in hauser - feshbach codes were calculated throughout the nuclear chart .",
    "the authors start from the skyrme hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean field , which provides the deformation parameters .",
    "however , they carry out the qrpa calculations for spherical shapes only and include the splitting caused by deformation in a phenomenological way .",
    "hence , qrpa describes the parts of the gdr width that originate from landau fragmentation and static deformation .",
    "the microscopic origin of the remaining part of the spreading of the gdr has been reviewed , for example , in ref .",
    "the escape width @xmath48 accounts for the emission of particles from the qrpa states .",
    "it is only of importance for light nuclei or nuclei near the drip lines .",
    "the spreading width @xmath49 describes the coupling to more complex configurations .",
    "it is suggested that the coupling to correlated four - quasiparticle states should contribute to @xmath50 , whereas the coupling to six - quasiparticle and higher - order quasiparticle excitations will only wash out some residual fluctuations of the strength function . for spherical nuclei ,",
    "the coupling to the four - quasiparticle configurations has been taken into account in the framework of the quasiparticle - phonon models , such as qpm @xcite , qrpa - pc @xcite , qtba @xcite and rqtba @xcite .",
    "the resulting strength functions reproduce the spreading of the gdr .",
    "although a generalization to nuclei with static deformation is possible @xcite , calculations have been restricted to spherical nuclei so far because of the substantial increase of the numerical work .",
    "however , principal problems arise in transitional nuclei that undergo large - amplitude shape fluctuations .",
    "in the following we suggest an alternative approach . we explicitely describe the coupling of the dipole vibration to the two - quasiparticle excitations by means of the qrpa for deformed shapes . out of the coupling of these qrpa doorway states to the more complex configurations we only take into account the low - energy collective quadrupole excitations , which represent the softest mode that couples most strongly to the dipole mode .",
    "the quadrupole mode is described by a model that allows for large amplitude motion , i.e. one that is suited for transitional nuclei , which are the main object of our work .",
    "the typical frequencies @xmath51 of _ collective _ quadrupole excitations are smaller than 1 mev , which means about a factor of 10 less than the energies @xmath52 of the dipole excitations .",
    "because the quadrupole motion is much slower than the dipole one we use the adiabatic approximation : by means of qrpa , we calculate the dipole absorption cross section @xmath53 for a set of instantaneous deformation parameters @xmath54 of the mean field .",
    "we determine the probability @xmath55 of each shape being present in the ground state and obtain the total cross section as the incoherent sum of the instantaneous ones , @xmath56.\\ ] ] the zero - point motion in the ground state with respect to the collective quadrupole modes is represented by the set of instantaneous shapes @xmath54 and their probabilities @xmath55 . as a first step , the ",
    "dynamical  ground state is constructed in the framework of the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) @xcite .",
    "iba is not a compulsory choice .",
    "other approaches that describe large - amplitude quadrupole motion could be used as well .",
    "however , iba treats the large amplitude quadrupole motion in an efficient way and has proven to be successful for a systematic description of transitional nuclei . in practice it is very easy to handle because it has a minimum set of free parameters .",
    "moreover , it allows us to generate the discrete set of instantaneous shapes @xmath54 and the probabilities @xmath55 in a simple way . in the next step ,",
    "a series of qrpa calculations is performed , where @xmath54 defines the shape of the woods - saxon ( ws ) potential in the qrpa hamiltonian .",
    "then the total cross section is obtained as the incoherent sum eq .",
    "( [ adiabat ] ) of the respective cross sections @xmath57 and @xmath58 multiplied by the probabilities @xmath55 .",
    "finally , the coupling to the more complex configurations is taken into account by folding @xmath59 with the breit - wigner function @xmath60 the width is chosen to depend quadratically on the photon energy @xmath10 as expected for collisional damping ( cd ) , i.e. @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this phenomenological correction as `` collisional damping '' ( iss+cd ) although it comprises all kinds of couplings that are not explicitly taken into account .",
    "the value @xmath62 used in our calculations corresponds to @xmath63 mev at @xmath64 15 mev . the relation @xmath65 is taken as a justification for neglecting possible phase correlations between the different shapes @xmath54 . in other words , we assume that the deformation does not change during the excitation of the nucleus by the absorbed photons , that is , the photon `` sees '' the shape of the nucleus that absorbs it .",
    "thus , the photon current on a target samples the various instantaneous shapes of the nuclei in the ground state .",
    "accordingly we suggest the name instantaneous shape sampling ( iss ) qrpa for the approach . in the following the different steps of the iss - qrpa approach",
    "are explained in more detail , results of calculations for a selection of nuclei are presented , and a more sophisticated justification of the iss procedure is given .",

    "taking into account the collisional damping ( cd ) by folding the discrete qrpa solutions with a breit - wigner function , the resulting iss+cd strength functions reproduce the exact ones very well , if the distance between the energies of the coupled states is smaller than the damping width .",
    "we applied our version of iss - qrpa to the chains of the kr , ba , xe , and sm isotopes , which all span the transitional regions between deformed and spherical shape .",
    "as in our previous study of the mo isotopes @xcite , we find that the dipole absorption cross section in the energy region of photo - nuclear reactions is determined by the landau fragmentation and the dynamical deformation . in order to reproduce the broad peak of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) additional cd",

    "collective hydrodynamic descriptions of the gdr give an increase of the low - energy dipole absorption cross section with nuclear deformation .",
    "it is caused by the splitting of the gdr into a low frequency oscillation along the long and two high frequency oscillations along the short axes . in the case of the mo and sm isotopic chains ,",
    "the deformation increases with neutron number .",
    "iss - qrpa reproduces the expected increase of the low - energy dipole absorption cross section .",

    "iss - qrpa predicts a nearly constant value of the cumulative low - energy cross section ( @xmath283 mev ) when approaching the shell closure .",
    "the reason is the @xmath225 decrease of the gdr peak energy as well as the progressive bunching of the two - qpasiparticle excitations when approaching spherical shape .    in the case of semi - magic nuclei , relicts of these bunches",
    "survive the damping by shape fluctuations and collisional damping .",
    "they appear as broad bumps in iss - qrpa cross section , which may substantially enhance the absorption cross section around the particle thresholds .",
