    "a recent analysis of the diffuse galactic emission in the energy range of 30 mev to 30 gev ( @xcite ) indicated that the spatial structure and total intensity of the emission observed by egret can be well understood as the result of interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium in addition to an isotropic extragalactic background .",
    "the main emission mechanisms are @xmath3 production and decay in inelastic collisions between cosmic ray nucleons and thermal gas ; bremsstrahlung of relativistic electrons in thermal gas ; and inverse - compton scattering of ambient mm - wave , infrared , and optical photons by highly relativistic electrons . the limitation of these studies is the inability to separate truly diffuse emission from that of unresolved discrete sources .    at energies above 1 gev the models predict only roughly 60% of the observed intensity .",
    "this effect is most significant in the galactic plane , but is not restricted to it .",
    "this discrepancy might be explained in two different ways .",
    "first , it may be that the galactic cosmic ray protons and/or electrons have a harder spectrum beyond 10 gev than those observed in the solar vicinity .",
    "second , there may be a number of unresolved point sources in the galactic plane with appropriate spectra .",
    "the spectrum of these sources would have to be harder than that of the galactic diffuse emission below a few gev and may roll over beyond a few gev .",
    "the only known objects with such spectra are pulsars , especially geminga - type pulsars .",
    "the attempt of this paper is twofold .",
    "we want to provide constraints on the general contribution of the most likely input from discrete sources ",
    "pulsars  to the diffuse galactic emission .",
    "we also want to find out whether or not unresolved pulsars can account for the observed excess at high energies .",
    "previous work has addressed the former problem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) primarily on the basis of pulsar models , for which the input parameters are not always well known .",
    "conversely , data have been used to limit the emission from millisecond pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we use a different strategy : instead of using models we will base our analysis solely on the properties of the six pulsars observed by egret . clearly , the main limitation of this approach is that the six objects are not necessarily representative for the whole population .",
    "the great advantage of our method however is that all spectral information can be taken into account .",
    "this will allow us to address whether pulsars can account for the observed excess at high energies .",
    "in general , pulsars are less luminous when older and they often exhibit spectral cut - offs at high energies . since the luminosity and spectral evolution provide the best parameters from which to estimate the contribution of pulsars to the diffuse emission , we will derive the luminosity of an ` ideal ' pulsar as a function of its age and its observed energy directly from the egret data . since this method will use the observed intensity of the pulsars at different energies , it will automatically account for the hard spectrum and for possible cut - offs without using power - law fit results on individual data .",
    "we will simultaneously calculate the diffuse intensity due to pulsars and the numbers of directly identifiable objects .",
    "the latter provides a constraint on otherwise weakly determined parameters like the birth rate and the beaming angle of pulsars , since the diffuse intensity due to unresolved pulsars scales almost linearily with the number of resolved pulsars .",
    "egret has identified six pulsars by their light curves .",
    "the differential photon spectra of these sources have been measured by @xcite from pulsed analysis .",
    "the restriction to pulsed analysis neglects part of possible unpulsed emission but allows us to obtain better spectra of the weak pulsars .",
    "the egret sensitivity is rather poor at the lowest energies so that we will concentrate on nine energy bands spanning 50 mev to 10 gev , for which we have the observed photon flux @xmath4 of pulsar @xmath5 in energy band @xmath6 . in an analogous way to the calculation for absolute brightnesses in optical astronomy",
    ", we multiply these fluxes by the square of the pulsar s distance @xmath7 to find fluxes we would observe from these sources if they were at unit distance . so in each of the nine energy bins we get the ` absolute ' intensity and the age of the six pulsars from our data .",
    "the basis of our modelling is the assumption that pulsars exhibit a correlation between absolute intensity and age",
    ". the slope and normalisation of this correlation may be different at different energies .",
    "this correlation , which describes sort of an ideal pulsar , will then be used to calculate the diffuse emission from unresolved pulsars together with the number of directly observable objects .",
    "there is no physical necessity why such a correlation should exist .",
    "the best evidence comes from the data themselves : the @xmath8 sums we obtain indicate that a correlation is an appropriate description of the data . in reality",
    "one should expect such a correlation to be noisy , i.e. that there is a probability distribution with a certain dispersion around the mean of the correlation , but in our case the limited number of degrees of freedom forces us to use the most simple correlation model , a power - law :    @xmath9    this relation can be fitted to the data on the basis of weighted least squares for all energy bins .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming gaussian errors in the measured luminosities .",
    "the kpc@xmath10 part of the units comes from our choice for the distance normalization .",
    "the distance @xmath7 and its uncertainty can be generally derived on the basis of the pulsar dispersion and rotation measure ( @xcite ) and only for extremely nearby objects like geminga by parallax measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "the age of pulsars can be estimated from the ratio of period and period derivative .",
    "the uncertainty of this measure of age is large , especially since pulsars often do not slow down solely by dipole radiation .",
    "we will use a factor of two for the age uncertainty @xmath11 , except for the crab for which the true age is taken with a nominal uncertainty of 10% .",
    "three sources of uncertainty have to be considered in the fit : uncertainties in intensity , in distance , and in age . while the intensity error can be assumed to follow a gaussian probability distribution , both the errors in age and distance appear in powers , so that their effective probability distributions are definitely not gaussian .",
    "furthermore , the way ages and distances are measured leads us to believe that a gaussian probability function is not a fair description of the actual error distributions .",
    "the errors in these parameters are sometimes of the same order as the estimates , clearly implying that their distributions are asymmetric .",
    "we can account for these effects and still use the @xmath8 method , if we assume that the error distributions for the logarithms of age and distance are gaussians .    to account for the different uncertainty distributions in the three paramters",
    ", we have separated the @xmath8-summation into three components .",
    "the total @xmath8 ( [ totalchi2 ] ) is found by combining the contributions of the intensity ( [ schi2 ] ) , the distance ( [ dchi2 ] ) , and the age ( [ tchi2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath12 where    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    an example of how a power - law relation fits to the pulsar data after distance normalization is shown in fig .",
    "[ lum ] where all sources of uncertainty are included as vertical and horizontal error bars .",
    "the results of the fitting procedure are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] , where the 1@xmath16 uncertainty of the fit parameters is estimated from the usual @xmath17 condition .",
    "for each source we can define a critical distance up to which the source can be detected directly , and beyond which it would contribute to the diffuse emission .",
    "the true flux threshold of the egret data has a rather awkward distribution on the sky .",
    "this is partly caused by the structure of the galactic background emission and partly by the uneven exposure .",
    "in addition to this , the broad point spread function of egret causes point sources to enhance the background over regions of around @xmath18sr , so that the yet detected sources already shadow more than 10% of the sky .",
    "monte - carlo simulations have shown that the significance of detection for an isolated egret source for the energy selection @xmath19100 mev is adequately represented as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the source flux in units of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the exposure in units of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the intensity of background emission in the region of the source in units of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is an empirically determined constant ( @xcite ) . with the standard thresholds of @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 outside the galactic plane we can use ( [ sig ] ) to calculate the sensitivity threshold @xmath31 for each viewing direction . to determine @xmath23",
    "we have summed the exposure of all viewing periods of the phases 1 - 4 corresponding to observations between april 1991 and september 1995 .",
    "the background intensity is the sum of the diffuse galactic emission ( @xcite ) , the extragalactic background ( @xcite ) , and the point - spread functions of all @xmath32 excesses which have been found in a maximum - likelihood search ( @xcite ) in the summed data of phases 1 - 4 .",
    "the sensitivity threshold @xmath31 corresponds to the integrated flux above 100 mev .",
    "thus the critical distance up to which a pulsar can be detected directly has to be calculated as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the width of the energy bin @xmath6 .",
    "it can be expected that out of the galactic plane @xmath35 generally exceeds the line - of - sight through the galactic disk , so that all pulsars would be detectable by egret .",
    "thus only in the galactic plane pulsars can contribute to the diffuse emission .",
    "the mean velocity of nearby pulsars is @xmath36 ( @xcite ) , and thus pulsars typically travel over a distance of 1 kpc in 2 million years .",
    "this is much larger than the vertical scale height , but considerably smaller than the radial scale length of the spatial distribution of pulsar birth locations ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the vertical distribution of pulsars will strongly depend on their age , and the radial distribution will remain basically unaffected .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the pulsar trajectories are not strongly influenced by the gravitational potential of the galaxy , except for the innermost kiloparsec around the galactic center .",
    "the potential gradients in vertical direction change the mean pulsar velocity only at the percent level over a million years .",
    "the radial gradients in the plane are balanced to first order by the galactic rotation .",
    "we may thus parametrize the normalized spatial distribution of pulsar birth locations in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath37 ) as    @xmath38    where the @xmath39-term accounts for the galactocentric gradient .",
    "the normalized spatial distribution of pulsars at time @xmath40 is then derived by integration over the 3d distribution of pulsar birth velocities @xmath41 ( @xcite ) @xmath42    with @xmath43 as the birth rate of pulsars and @xmath44 as the fraction which radiates in our direction we can determine the number of directly detectable pulsars by integration over the line - of - sight , solid angle , and age @xmath45 as well as the diffuse emission of unresolved pulsars @xmath46 where    @xmath47    please note that any change in the total number of pulsars has similar impact on the number of directly observable pulsars as on the intensity of unresolved objects .",
    "thus the direct detections provide a strong constraint on the pulsar contribution to the diffuse galactic emission and limit our choice of @xmath48 .    with ( [ diffemis ] ) we can now calculate the spectrum of unresolved pulsars and compare it to the spectrum of the total observed diffuse emission .",
    "this is shown for the galactic center direction in fig .",
    "[ spec0 ] and for the anticenter in fig .",
    "[ spec180 ] , where we plot the fraction of the total observed emission which is due to pulsars .",
    "the data have been deconvolved to correct for the effects of egret s point - spread - function ( @xcite ) . a radial scale length @xmath49=3.5 kpc was used for the spatial distribution of pulsars .",
    "the maximum age @xmath50 used is @xmath51years , though the spectra depend only weakly on age ; the age affects the number of directly observable objects @xmath52 nearly as much as the predicted emission of unresolved pulsars @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , a larger @xmath50 would require extrapolation too far beyond the range of pulsar ages for which we have data . as we will see later ,",
    "@xmath50 does have a strong influence on the latitude distributions of observable pulsars as well as of the pulsar contribution to the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the parameters used here ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) imply that around 14 pulsars should be detectable by egret , which is to be compared to a total galactic population of @xmath56 pulsars which radiate in our direction . since six",
    "are already identified this would mean that another eight unidentified sources are actually pulsars .",
    "considering the integrated intensity above 100 mev in this example pulsars would cause 10% of the observed intensity in the galactic center direction and about 3% in the anticenter direction .",
    "pulsars contribute very little off the plane . in direction l@xmath570@xmath58 , b@xmath578@xmath58 we get around 1% ,",
    "so that integrated over the sky pulsars provide only a few percent of the observed diffuse emission , consistent with earlier estimates based on pulsar emission models .",
    "this is also true for the emission at higher energies .",
    "we have compared the latitude distribution of the observed diffuse emission above 1 gev to what our model predicts for the pulsar contribution .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "4 where we show the distribution of the diffuse intensity at energies above 1 gev as averages over longitude .",
    "we find that pulsars contribute strongly only very close to the plane where the lines - of - sight are long , but the observed emission does fall off much less rapidly with latitude than the emission of unresolved pulsars .",
    "also the observed spectral discrepancy above 1 gev seems to extend to latitudes @xmath59 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we would allow for higher pulsar ages , say @xmath60 years , the latitude distribution of the emission of unresolved pulsars would get close to that of the observed emission",
    ". however , for the same number of directly observable pulsars only around 6% of the observed diffuse emission above 1 gev would be caused by unresolved pulsars , as shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "4 . in our study",
    "the beaming fraction @xmath61 is taken to be a constant .",
    "any physical variation of @xmath61 in the regime of observed pulsar ages ( @xmath62 years ) should be accounted for by our fit parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "any variations of @xmath61 at higher pulsar ages can not be accounted for .",
    "the fact that no pulsar with rotational age of 1 million years or higher has been observed indicates strongly that emission of pulsars ceases at ages of roughly 1 million years .",
    "note that for @xmath65 years more than 50% of all observable pulsars in our model would be older than 1 million years .",
    "hence the results we present for a high @xmath50 serve to demonstrate the basic behaviour rather than to provide a realistic estimate .    many of the observable pulsars should be located at higher latitudes .",
    "we expect 58% of pulsars at @xmath66 ( 74% in case of @xmath65 years ) and 31% at latitudes @xmath67 ( 53% in case of @xmath65 years ) .",
    "the dominant contribution of unresolved pulsars to the diffuse emission is above 1 gev , where in direction of the galactic center around 18% of the total observed emission could be provided with approximately 14 directly observable objects .",
    "approximately 30 pulsars would have to be directly observable to account for 100% of the discrepancy between model predictions and the observed spectrum in this direction .",
    "this seems unreasonable since only few of the unidentified egret sources show the typical pulsar - like spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , studies of known radio pulsars have led to constraining upper limits for pulsed emission for most of them ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a few pulsars are positionally coincident with unidentified egret sources but it is unclear whether the emission is caused by the pulsar , the supernova remnant , or any other nearby system .",
    "a deep search for radio pulsars in the error boxes of 19 unidentified egret sources has been performed recently ( @xcite ) .",
    "though data were taken at three different frequencies to minimize selection effects , no new pulsars were found .",
    "so the detectable but not yet detected pulsars would have to be either radio - quiet or located in active regions like snob s ( @xcite ) which would impede the radio detection by their high and possibly variable dispersion measures .",
    "it is interesting to see that roughly 10 unidentified egret sources can be associated either with snr or with ob associations or with both ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , supernova remnants only live for around @xmath68years , so that preferentially young pulsars would be expected to be associated with them , whereas the bulk of the observable pulsars should be old . from our modeling",
    "we expect 24% of the observable pulsars at an age less than @xmath68years and 76% older than this ( for @xmath69years ) .",
    "therefore we should not assume too many young pulsars hidden in regions of high electron density without having a corresponding number of old pulsars .",
    "it thus seems reasonable that a only a few pulsars are hidden radio pulsars .",
    "it is also possible that there is a substantial number of radio - quiet but loud pulsars .",
    "though an extensive search for pulsars among the brightest unidentified egret point sources has obtained only upper limits to date ( @xcite ) , the spatial and flux distribution of unidentified egret sources has been reported to be compatible with the majority of them being pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "if these were all geminga - like , the corresponding unresolved sources would contribute strongly to the diffuse emission above 1 gev .",
    "since our analysis is based on the observed properties of mainly radio - loud pulsars , any basic difference in the emission properties between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects would severely affect the predictions and leave us without a reliable tool to estimate numbers .",
    "this would be true even if the recent detection of weak pulsed radio emission from geminga can be confirmed ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the small fraction of unidentified egret sources which shows pulsar - like or geminga - like spectra ( @xcite ) argues strongly against the bulk of unidentified sources being pulsars .",
    "also a substantial fraction of the unidentified egret sources in the galactic plane appears to be variable which makes the identification of _ all _ unidentified sources with pulsars even more unlikely ( @xcite ) .",
    "in total , we think that around 14 directly observable pulsars , of which six are already identified , is a reasonable number , and that thus the calculated contribution of unresolved pulsars can be taken as serious estimate .",
    "the main systematical uncertainty in our study definitely is that the six identified pulsars may not be a representative sample . on the other hand",
    ", we do not need to base our study on a theoretical model which may or may not be a fair description of nature .",
    "we find that pulsars contribute very little to the diffuse emission at lower energies , whereas above 1 gev they can account for 18% of the observed intensity in selected regions .",
    "this seems not to be enough to explain the discrepancy between observed intensity and model predictions based on cosmic - ray interactions in this regime .",
    "we also find that pulsars contribute mainly close to the plane where the lines - of - sight are long , but the observed emission does fall off much less rapidly than this .",
    "also the observed spectral discrepancy between the data above 1 gev and the predictions of cosmic ray models seems to extend to latitudes @xmath59 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus there must be additional effects playing a r^ ole for the observed diffuse emission above 1 gev .",
