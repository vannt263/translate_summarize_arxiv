    "the literature on the deformation of fluid elements in chaotic and turbulent flows is immense .",
    "mainly the focus has been on the lyapunov exponents , which characterize the exponential rate of separation of neighboring trajectories , and thus also represent the rate of stretching of fluid elements . for instance , the distribution of lyapunov exponents has been used to characterize the diffusive decay of variance of an advected scalar  @xcite , because in incompressible flows the stretching of fluid elements has an associated contraction and thus serves to amplify gradients , thus enhancing the efficiency of diffusion .    much less attention has been paid the evolution of curvature in chaotic and turbulent flows .",
    "the curvature represents a higher - order deformation of fluid elements than stretching . to leading order",
    ", one can think of the stretching as deforming an initially spherical fluid element into an ellipsoid ; the curvature then represents a bending of the axes of the ellipsoid .",
    "since stretching tends to occur along a dominant direction , so the effect of curvature is most easily observed along that dominant direction of stretching .",
    "mathematically , the stretching depends on first derivatives of the velocity field ( essentially the local strain ) , whereas curvature depends on its first and second derivatives .",
    "it has been observed that the magnitude of stretching and of curvature are anticorrelated in a flow  @xcite : wherever the flow experiences large amounts of stretching the fluid elements ( and hence material lines ) tend to be straight , and vice - versa .",
    "intuitively , one can see that this is a result of the competing effects of curvature and stretching : the flow can pull on a material line or bend it , but the effects are orthogonal  stretching is the result of a pull along the material line , whereas curvature arises from perpendicular deformations .",
    "this provides a motivation for the study of curvature in a flow , because being a purely geometrical quantity it can be measured directly from pictures of material lines ( which can easily be obtained from experiments ) . in this manner",
    "one can get a rough estimate of regions of high and low stretching .",
    "this is a useful guide when trying to maximize the efficiency of mixing by varying the properties of the flow  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the form of the dependence between stretching and curvature along material lines .",
    "there is a  @xmath0 power - law relation between the magnitude of stretching and curvature along sharp bends of material lines advected by a flow .",
    "we present evidence for this based on numerical experiments .",
    "we then explain the  @xmath0 power law using two models .",
    "the first is based on a single sharp bend in a material line where only the shape of the bend is taken into account ; it has the advantage of being straightforward and intuitive , but does not account for the range of features observed .",
    "the second model uses a foliation of bends , to correct the deficiency of the first model of treating material lines as isolated objects in the flow .",
    "we make use of a local `` conservation law '' for lyapunov exponents that allows a more complete description of the relationship between curvature and stretching for the foliation of bends . in particular , the conservation law predicts a dependence on the shape of neighboring material lines near a particular bend .",
    "we first discuss the kinematics of stretching of a material line advected by a flow   in an  @xmath1-dimensional space . here",
    "@xmath2 is the position at time  @xmath3 ( the eulerian coordinate ) of a fluid element that was originally at  @xmath4 at time  @xmath5 ( the lagrangian coordinate ) .",
    "the flow  @xmath6 is typically the result of the integration of a velocity field  @xmath7 , but it could also be given by a map .",
    "a vector  @xmath8 is transformed to a vector  @xmath9 at time  @xmath3 by the relation @xmath10^i}_q      { \\ensuremath{\\mathrel{\\raisebox{.069ex}{:}\\!\\!=}}}\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\partial}}{\\ensuremath{\\phi}}^i}{{\\ensuremath{\\partial}}{\\ensuremath{a}}^q}({t},{t}_0;{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{{\\ensuremath{a}}}}}}),\\ ] ] where repeated indices are summed ; @xmath11 is known as the tangent mapping of the flow . because we are interested in the state of material lines in the eulerian ( @xmath2 ) frame , we wish to hold  @xmath2 constant and integrate backward in time to obtain   ( if  @xmath6 is a map we iterate its inverse ) .",
    "we thus rewrite the tangent mapping as a function of  @xmath2 , @xmath12 which can easily be verified by differentiating the identity  @xmath13 with respect to  @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix  @xmath11 is obtained directly from integrating @xmath14 as  @xmath15 ; here  @xmath16 is evaluated at  . in practice , there are more accurate numerical methods available , based on matrix decomposition techniques  @xcite .",
    "the stretching of vectors as they are advected by the flow is expressed in the eulerian frame by the left cauchy  green tensor  @xcite , @xmath17 being a symmetric positive - definite matrix , the cauchy ",
    "green tensor  @xmath18 admits  @xmath1 real positive eigenvalues  @xmath19 with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors  @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the eigenvalues are nondegenerate ( at least for large  @xmath21 ) , and without loss of generality order them such that  @xmath22 .",
    "the  @xmath23 s are called the _ coefficients of expansion _ , and their exponential growth rates @xmath24 are known as the finite - time lyapunov exponents .",
    "the theorem of oseledec  @xcite asserts that for ergodic measure - preserving systems the limit as  @xmath25 ( or in our case  @xmath15 ) exists for almost all initial conditions ( or in our case the final condition  @xmath2 at  @xmath3 , held fixed ) .",
    "the positivity of the largest lyapunov exponent is the usual criterion for the presence of chaos .",
    "because the eigenvalue of largest stretching plays an important role in our development , we often write  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 for  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 , where the letter  @xmath30 stands for `` unstable '' .",
    "note that we shall not assume that  @xmath31 has converged , only that it is positive `` most of the time , '' in the sense that  @xmath28 is exponentially large for large  @xmath21 .",
    "thus our treatment is valid even for aperiodic flows , where the lyapunov exponents are not guaranteed to converge .",
    "the eigenvector  @xmath27 is the direction along which a fluid element has on average experienced the most stretching throughout its history ; this direction converges exponentially to an asymptotic direction  @xmath32 as  @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "we can integrate this vector field , @xmath33 to yield a curve  @xmath34 through  @xmath35 .",
    "this ( infinite ) curve is known as the _ global unstable manifold _ through  @xmath35 , and is parametrized by the arc length  @xmath36 along the curve from  @xmath35 .",
    "it corresponds to the unstable manifold of a hyperbolic orbit and converges to that orbit as  @xmath15 . in a given chaotic region ,",
    "all global unstable manifolds are equivalent to each other  @xcite ; this equivalence class of unstable manifolds is called the _ unstable foliation_. we will think of the representative point  @xmath35 as labeling a particular unstable manifold .",
    "now consider a material line  @xmath37 at time  @xmath3 , and let  @xmath38 be the unit tangent to the line  @xmath37 at  @xmath2 .",
    "it is well - known that a material line advected by a chaotic flow aligns with the unstable foliation of the flow , a phenomenon sometimes referred to as _ asymptotic directionality",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that if fluid elements are being stretched along a preferred direction then they appear to align along that direction .",
    "this means that the tangent  @xmath39 aligns with the most unstable eigenvector  @xmath40 of the flow as  @xmath15 .",
    "the components of  @xmath39 initially orthogonal to  @xmath40 decay in proportion to their slower stretching rates as compared to  @xmath26 .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath41 where the  @xmath42 are nonexponential functions , that is , they may grow or decay algebraically ( or be identically zero ) but may not do so exponentially ; they are given by the initial condition of  @xmath43 .",
    "the normalization condition of  @xmath39 implies @xmath44 where the sign ambiguity occurs because the direction of the alignment is a matter of convention . thus  @xmath45 as  @xmath15 , whereas the other  @xmath42 decay exponentially as  @xmath46 , a consequence of the ordering and nondegeneracy assumptions for the  @xmath47 s .",
    "let  @xmath48 denote the infinitesimal element of arc length at some point on the line . to measure the relative growth of this element",
    ", we need to know its length  @xmath49 at an earlier time  , @xmath50 the square - root in   is the jacobian  @xmath51 , since the arc length changes by the same proportion as the length of the tangent . inserting the tangent   in the expression   for the length element",
    ", we find @xmath52 where we have used   from the definition of the eigenvectors .",
    "because of the chaotic nature of the flow , @xmath53 grows exponentially in time , with  @xmath54 the largest finite - time lyapunov exponent . in general , then , the ratio  @xmath55 grows exponentially with  @xmath21 , reflecting the growth of material lines as they are advected by the flow .",
    "the local stretching of the line ,  @xmath55 , varies both because of the inherent nonuniformity in infinitesimal stretching , as described by  @xmath26 , but also because the initial material line at  @xmath5 is typically aligned differently with respect to the global unstable manifold at different points , as described by the  @xmath42 s .",
    "however , the first effect is exponential in time , whereas the second is only algebraic .",
    "we can further differentiate these temporal behaviors , as we now proceed to show .",
    "if  @xmath21 is moderately large then the material line has aligned with the global unstable manifold , that is , it is tangent to  @xmath40 at every point .",
    "the relative change in  @xmath56 along  @xmath39 satisfies @xmath57 where  @xmath58 depends on  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 but not on the initial time  @xmath5 .",
    "( we define  @xmath58 more precisely below in  . )",
    "this asymptotic form is a consequence of the results on derivatives of finite - time lyapunov of ref .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the relative change in  @xmath42 is @xmath59 consistent with the  @xmath42 being defined in lagrangian coordinates , so the stretching along  @xmath40 in eulerian coordinates smooths out their functional dependence .",
    "integrating equation   allows us to write @xmath60 where  @xmath61 is the coefficient of expansion evaluated at an arbitrary reference point  @xmath35 on the manifold  @xmath34 , defined by eq .",
    "this is true as long as we are considering a line segment  @xmath62 that is shorter than  @xmath26 , otherwise the higher - order terms in   can not be neglected .",
    "the asymptotic exponential dependence of  @xmath26 on  @xmath21 is entirely contained in  @xmath61 , because  @xmath63 does not depend on  @xmath5 .    similarly , eq",
    ".   implies that the  @xmath42 are constant in space along  @xmath62 as long as it is shorter than  @xmath26 .",
    "we can then absorb the constant  @xmath64 into  @xmath61 and rewrite   as @xmath65 where  @xmath61 is constant in space along the line  @xmath37 .",
    "the main result of this section is thus given by  .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we shall examine line segments at fixed  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , letting  @xmath5 recede to  @xmath66 .",
    "since the segments we consider are much shorter than  @xmath26 , we find that the local stretching ( coefficient of expansion ) of a material line can be characterized by the deviation  @xmath67 from the overall stretching of the line segment ,  @xmath61 .",
    "the somewhat surprising results are that ( i ) the deviation  @xmath67 is independent of  @xmath5 , and ( ii ) the overall stretching of the line is well - defined ( _ i.e. _ , it is constant along the line ) .",
    "the rate of overall stretching of the line of course converges to the topological entropy .",
    "we note in closing this section that there is an ambiguity in the decomposition  :  @xmath61 and  @xmath67 are only defined up to a multiplicative function of  @xmath35 and  @xmath3 .",
    "we resolve this by integrating   over  @xmath37 , to find @xmath68 where  @xmath69 is the length of  @xmath62 and  @xmath70 is an average over the line  @xmath62 .",
    "clearly a proper definition of the overall growth  @xmath61 of the material line should be that it is equal to the growth of the length  @xmath71 .",
    "an appropriate choice for the definition of  @xmath61 and  @xmath67 is thus to scale them such that @xmath72 which we assume to hold .",
    "in this section we present the result of numerical calculations comparing the stretching and the curvature along material lines . because we are interested in material lines that have evolved for a long time in the flow ( long compared to the inverse lyapunov exponent ) , it is sufficient to compute the shape of unstable manifolds by integrating   starting at sample points  @xmath2 at time  @xmath3 in the fluid domain .",
    "two prototypical systems will be used .",
    "the first is the ubiquitous standard map , @xmath73 where  @xmath74\\times[0,1]$ ] .",
    "maps of course have the advantage that they are computationally efficient , allowing rapid verification of results .",
    "another desirable feature of   is that for large  @xmath75 the structure of material lines advected by the map is fairly simple , as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : uman_stmap ] which has  @xmath76 .",
    "the diagonal bias in the figure is due to the sweeping of the sine wave on both side of  , which at such large  @xmath75 traverses the domain several times for each iteration , breaking ( almost ) all islands .",
    "the map is area - preserving , so that the determinant of  @xmath18 is  @xmath77 .",
    "the second system we shall use is the cellular flow of solomon and gollub  @xcite , with velocity field @xmath78 to model an array of oscillating convection rolls , periodic in  @xmath79 and with rigid walls at  @xmath80 and  @xmath81 .",
    "the  @xmath82 dependence is chosen to satisfy the rigid boundary conditions at the walls .",
    "the velocity field is incompressible ( @xmath83 ) , so that  @xmath77 . when @xmath84 , the flow is steady , and the trajectories of fluid elements are nonchaotic .",
    "this is true in general of any two - dimensional steady flow  @xcite . a snapshot of typical material lines advected by   are shown in fig .  [ fig : uman_crollsns ] .",
    "note the two large regular islands in the center .",
    "our interest lies in the variations of stretching and curvature along material lines .",
    "the local stretching is given by the coefficient of expansion  @xmath26 , but since we let the material lines evolve for some time ( such that  @xmath85 ) it is sufficient to consider the @xmath5-independent deviation from mean stretching ,  @xmath58 , defined in section  [ sec : stretching ] .",
    "thus , for convenience we will refer to  @xmath58 as `` the stretching '' even though it needs to be multiplied by an overall factor  @xmath86 to represent the total stretching a line has experienced .",
    "figure  [ fig : lamt_curv_vs_tauh ]    is a plot of the stretching and curvature as they vary along a typical material line advected by our two prototypical systems .",
    "the first thing to note is that the stretching  @xmath58 is smooth along the material line ( the sharp dips are well - resolved ) .",
    "it is known that the finite - time lyapunov exponents are not continuous functions of the spatial variables , but fig .",
    "[ fig : lamt_curv_vs_tauh ] underscores that the rough variation of the exponents ( and hence the stretching ) occurs perpendicular to the unstable direction . in the lagrangian frame , holding  @xmath4 fixed instead of  @xmath2 , it is the variation along the contracting direction that is smooth  @xcite .",
    "( the variation of the stretching along the characteristic directions is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "a second observation is that the variations in the stretching are very large , encompassing about four orders of magnitude or more in typical cases . this says that not all points in the flow are equally propitious to stretching , and that the variations can be sizeable even within a single chaotic region .",
    "because the coefficient of expansion denotes a fluid elements s history of stretching , the large variations imply that some trajectories avoid regions of significant stretching for a long time .    the third striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : lamt_curv_vs_tauh ] is the close anticorrelation between stretching and curvature  high curvature regions are invariably associated with relatively low stretching .",

    "on the curvature of fluid elements  @xcite .",
    "this and later work on turbulence and random flows  @xcite and deterministic flows  @xcite focused on the probability distribution of curvature and on comparing stretching and curvature at a point .",
    "here we investigate how stretching and curvature vary along material lines , with the intention of gaining a better understanding of their relationship .    with this in mind",
    "it is natural to plot the stretching and curvature of fig .",

    "we propose a simple physical picture in  2d  to reproduce the  @xmath88 law around sharp bends .",
    "we refer to this picture as the `` simple bend model '' .",
    "we examine the model in detail , and point out its advantages and failures .",
    "its advantages are simplicity and a physically intuitive formulation .",
    "its failures are that it refers to a specific initial configuration of the material line , and that it does not account for the deviations from the  @xmath0 law observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamt_vs_curv ] ; these shortcomings will be addressed by a more refined model in section  [ sec : conslaws ] .",

    "we can directly compute the curvature , @xmath93 but  @xmath94 is a measure of  @xmath58 , the relative local stretching of the material line  @xcite . hence",
    ", if the variation in  @xmath95 can be neglected , eq .   gives the desired power - law relationship between curvature and stretching .",
    "that  @xmath95 can be neglected is a consequence of the sharpness of the bend : a taylor series expansion of  @xmath91 ( in a rotated and translated coordinate system ) @xmath96 will be dominated by the quadratic term near the tip of the bend : the cubic and other odd terms can not dominate , otherwise the profile would not resemble a sharp bend . while it is possible that quartic or higher - order terms are important in characterizing the shape of a given bend , we assume that there is nothing special about this particular bend so that the quadratic term dominates ( in principle many shapes of bends will occur in a chaotic flow ) .",
    "this will always be true if we are near enough the tip .",
    "the coefficient  @xmath97 is large and gives the curvature at the tip of the bend .",
    "it is encouraging that such a straightforward physical picture reproduces the salient features of stretching and folding in a chaotic flow .",

    "first , it requires a consideration of the initial shape of the material line . in a chaotic flow ,",
    "the  @xmath0 law is observed for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "the second problem is that deviations from the strict  @xmath0 law are not of the form predicted by the model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamt_vs_curv ] , some of the bends appear `` fat '' , that is , the maxima of stretching and curvature do not exactly coincide .",
    "the only deviations allowed in the simple bend model arise from a non - quadratic bend profile .",
    "but the bends that exhibit deviations from the law in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamt_vs_curv ] have a profile that is essentially quadratic near the tip .",
    "we resolve this discrepancy in section  [ sec : conslaws ] by allowing the bend to be surrounded by a continuum ( a _ foliation _ ) of other bends and using a conservation law for lyapunov exponents .",
    "the failures of the simple bend model in section  [ sec : simplebend ] lies in the material lines not being isolated objects in the fluid : they are surrounded by a continuum of other material lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : uman_stmap ] shows a material line that has been advected by the standard map , for a large value of the control parameter  @xmath75 ( by `` advection '' in the context of a map we simply mean iterating an initial distribution ) . at these highly chaotic values of  @xmath75 , the material line exhibits a surprising degree of regularity . indeed , the visible folds ( there are also tiny bends too small to see ) resemble a nested set of the simple bend we discussed in section  [ sec : simplebend ] .",
    "this suggests extending the model to treat a _",

    "numerical investigation indicates that the  @xmath0 law often holds in 3daround sharp bends , but not always  possibly a signature of torsion ( the bend is no longer planar ) .",
    "a complete 3d  description would have to take into account possible torsion in the material lines and will be the focus of future research .",
    "if the flow is compressible , then a simple modification of   starting from   gives @xmath131 where we have assumed  @xmath104 depends only on  @xmath79 .",
    "the  @xmath0 law will thus not be affected by compressibility as long as the variations in  @xmath104 are unimportant around sharp bends , which is usually the case because of the localized nature of the bends .",
    "we may consider instead of bends a foliation of horizontal lines , so that",
    ". then we conclude from   that  , for  .",
    "such a foliation corresponds to a region of vanishing curvature , and the constant stretching is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamt_vs_curv_stmap ] ( upper - left portion of the plot ) . the cellular flow ,",
    "[ fig : lamt_vs_curv_crollsns ] , does not exhibit the constancy of  @xmath26 in regions of low curvature , indicating that in this less idealized situation the variation of the vector field  @xmath40 perpendicular to itself can not be neglected .",
    "though stretching of fluid elements is more directly relevant to physical problems such as mixing , understanding the kinematics of curvature is also important .",
    "a compelling reason is that , unlike stretching , curvature is directly measurable from simple visualization experiments , being a purely geometrical quantity . stretching and curvature are not independent , and it is hoped that techniques such as those described herein can be used to relate their distribution .",
    "for instance , the  @xmath0 law suggests that low values of stretching are closely correlated to high curvature regions in a universal manner , and thus the corresponding tail of the two distributions can have similar properties .",
    "there is some indication that this is the case , and future work will address such statistical correlations .",
