    "the hadroproduction of the particles with open charm is a rich area to explore the hadronization process of heavy quarks . in hadronic interactions ,",
    "it is especially interesting to compare the forward production characteristics of a given charm particle species for different beam hadrons .",
    "the hadronization process may introduce a distinction between those charm hadrons which have a valence quark or anti - quark in common with the beam compared to those which do not .",
    "we assume that charm production can be factorized into perturbative and non - perturbative elements .",
    "the first part describes the production of the pair @xmath5 which the @xmath6 fusion mechanism is the main diagram .",
    "this is calculable in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , which does not predict any asymmetry between the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 produced .",
    "next  to  leading order pqcd calculations introduce a small asymmetry in the quark momenta  @xcite .",
    "the soft part , or hadronization , describes the process by which charmed quarks appear as hadrons in the final state .",
    "only phenomenological models exist at this stage . for",
    "@xmath1 beams a large asymmetry has been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we present here preliminary results for charm - anticharm asymmetries for @xmath2 production from three different beams .",
    "charm decays are also important laboratories for understanding pqcd at the charm mass scale . state  of  the  art methods for calculating non - leptonic decay rates of the charmed hadrons employ heavy quark effective theory and the factorization approximation  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the three  body cabibbo  suppressed decays of charmed baryons are prohibitively difficult to calculate .",
    "measurements of relative branching fraction between simple charmed baryon states , both cabibbo  favored and cabibbo  suppressed , give additional insight into the structure of the decay amplitude and the validity of the factorization approximation . until now the only cabibbo  suppressed charmed baryon decay reported with significant statistics is @xmath9 and its resonant state , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we report the first observation of the cabibbo  suppressed @xmath11 and determine the branching fraction of this decay relative to the cabibbo  favored @xmath12 mode .",
    "selex is a high energy hadroproduction experiment at fermilab using a multi  stage spectrometer designed for high acceptance for forward interactions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the experiment aimed especially to understand charm production in the forward hemisphere and to study charmed baryon decays . using both a negative hyperon beam ( 50% @xmath0 , 50% @xmath1 ) and a proton beam ( 92% p , 8% @xmath14 ) , selex took 15.2 billion interaction events during the 19961997 fix target run , tagging 600 gev @xmath0 , @xmath1 and 540 gev @xmath15 beams with a beam trd .",
    "the data were accumulated using a segmented charm target ( 5 foils : 2 cu , 3 c , each separated by 1.5 cm ) whose total thickness was 5% of interaction length for protons .",
    "the spectrometer had silicon strip detectors to measure beam and outgoing tracks and provided precision primary and secondary vertex reconstruction .",
    "transverse position resolution was 4 @xmath16 for the 600 gev beam and the average longitudinal vertex position resolution was 270 @xmath16 for primary and 560 @xmath16 for secondaries , respectively .",
    "track momenta were measured after magnetic deflection by a system of proportional wire chambers ( pwc ) , drift chambers and silicon strip detectors .",
    "track momentum resolution for a typical 100 gev track was @xmath17% .",
    "the absolute momentum scale was calibrated to the @xmath18 mass . for @xmath19",
    "decays the average mass resolution was 9 mev for @xmath20 momenta from 100 - 450 gev .",
    "charged particle identification was done with the ring image @xmath21erenkov radiation ( rich ) detector  @xcite which distinguished @xmath22 from @xmath23 up to 165 gev .",
    "the proton identification efficiency was greater than 95% above proton threshold ( @xmath24 gev ) and the pion mis  identification probability was about 4% .",
    "interactions were selected by a scintillator trigger and an online software filter .",
    "the charm trigger required at least 4 charged tracks and 2 hits in a scintillator hodoscope after the second analyzing magnet .",
    "we triggered on about 1/3 of all inelastic interactions .",
    "based on downstream tracking with particle identification information , the online filter selected events that had evidence for a secondary vertex among tracks completely reconstructed using the forward pwc spectrometer and the vertex silicon .",
    "this filter reduced the data size by a factor of nearly 8 at a cost of about a factor of 2 in charm written to tape as normalized from a study of unfiltered @xmath18 and @xmath25 decays .",
    "most of the charm loss came from selection cuts that were independent of charm species or kinematic variables and which improved the signal / noise in the final sample .",
    "the charm events were selected by the following requirements ; ( 1 ) fits for both primary and secondary vertex have @xmath26 5 , ( 2 )",
    "longitudinal separation l between primary and secondary vertices is greater than 8 times the combined longitudinal error @xmath27 , and ( 3 ) the reconstructed momentum vector from the secondary vertex points back to the primary vertex with good quality @xmath28 , and ( 4 ) @xmath29 for k identification and @xmath30 for @xmath15 identification , where @xmath31 is the likelihood function based on rich information .",
    "additional cuts will be explicitly described if applied .",
    "the production properties of charm quarks require measurements of charm hadrons .",
    "pqcd calculations can be probed experimentally using measurements of single - charm - particle inclusive distributions as a function of @xmath3 and asymmetries , either integrated or as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "previous charm hadroproduction experiments showed evidence of a large enhancement in the forward production of charmed particles that contain a quark or an antiquark in common with the beam ( _ leading particles _ ) over those that do not ( _ non - leading particles _ ) , in the meson sector .",
    "recently , this study has been extended to the production of baryons by a @xmath0 beam  @xcite .",
    "according to our simulations and our measurements of @xmath18 decays , the selex spectrometer acceptance is charge independent and we have a smooth , generally constant acceptance as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath32 .",

    "the effect is even more pronounced when the charm baryons are produced by a baryon beam .",
    "one typical explanation of this observed asymmetry is that longitudinal momentum is added to the produced charm quark if it recombines with a valence quark from the incoming particle , forming the leading particle shown in fig .",
