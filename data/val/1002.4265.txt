    "the tachyon condensation can leave lower dimensional topological defects after the annihilation of d - brane and anti - d - brane .",
    "in our case of the phase - separated two - component becs , the annihilation of the 2-dimensional defects ( domain walls ) leaves 1-dimensional defects ( quantized vortices ) , which we would like to identify as closed fundamental strings because it can end on a domain wall . in string theory , creation of lower dimensional d - branes after d - brane annihilation was studied very well @xcite , while creation of closed fundamental strings is in general difficult to deal with .",
    "contrary to this , it is easy in principle in our case to study closed string creation in connection with tachyonic fluctuations , which will be one of merits of our system .",
    "a d - brane soliton similar to ours can be identified with a d - brane in string theory @xcite in a tachyon effective field theory ( known as the minahan - zwiebach model @xcite ) on a non - bps d - brane .",
    "furthermore , a brane - anti - brane annihilation was studied in the minahan - zwiebach model in @xcite . there , a string connecting between the two branes and tachyon fluctuations were studied . in the case of our d - brane solitons too , one can construct a string between a pair of brane and anti - brane .",
    "investigation of tachyonic fluctuations with or without a string between two branes will be reported elsewhere .",
    "our system does not have supersymmetry which is a basic ingredient in string theory . nevertheless , our d - brane soliton is stable because it is topological , in contrast to d - branes in string theory which are stable due to supersymmetry . as this concern",
    "we have two comments .",
    "one is that our system can be made supersymmetric without changing the bosonic part by introducing additional fermions to the system .",
    "for example , the non - relativistic superstring can be realized by trapping the fermionic atoms in the core of vortices in a bec @xcite .",
    "several studies proposed the possible simulation of ( non)relativistic supersymmetry models using a mixture of ultracold fermions and diatomic bosons in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "then we expect that our d - brane soliton can become a bps object preserving a fraction of supersymmetry , as in d - branes in string theory .",
    "in fact at least in the sigma model limit , our solitons reduces to a bps soliton of supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "there is merit in studying further by bringing supersymmetry in our system .",
