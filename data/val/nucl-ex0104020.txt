    "one predicted result of a first order phase transition to a quark gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions is a long lived state due to the large latent heat and corresponding reduction in pressure gradients in the created system @xcite .",
    "the primary method for measuring the space - time extent of heavy - ion collisions is two particle interferometry , which has been utilized in hadronic interactions from proton induced to nuclear collisions . for an incoherent source ( @xmath1 ) of identical bosons , the normalized probability of detecting two particles with relative momentum @xmath2 and average momentum @xmath3",
    "is given by the correlation function ( @xmath4 ) :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the four - position , and the integral is taken over all space - time .",
    "the direct utilization of this technique is hindered in principle because equation [ eq : c2 ] is uninvertible : the source has 7 independent variables while the measured correlation function has 6 .",
    "furthermore , due to limited statistics most recent heavy ion experiments have chosen to plot and fit the correlation function in only three of the six dimensions versus the bertsch - pratt @xcite projection of @xmath7 in the out - side - long directions :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the momentum difference in the beam direction , @xmath10 , in the pair momentum direction , and @xmath11 , the corresponding orthogonal direction .",
    "a benefit of such a fit is that , for a well - behaved , gaussian source with no position - momentum correlations or resonances , the lifetime is simply determined by the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 @xcite . in such studies the k - dependence of the hbt radii is usually explored by repeating the fitting procedure with a subsample of the entire dataset of pairs .",
    "the phenix experiment is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . for the analysis described in this article we use the data collected in the summer of 2000 .",
    "after all offline analysis cuts , the data sample was approximately 1.5 million events .",
    "this analysis used a subset of all of the detectors in the experiment . for vertex information and centrality definitions we rely on a pair of cerenkov beam counters and zero - degree calorimeters ; the beam counters also act as the start of the time of flight measurements .",
    "the two drift chambers measure the deflection of particles through the magnetic field and , hence , their momentum , while the velocity is measured by either the time - of - flight wall ( tof ) or the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "the tof timing resolution is approximately 115 ps @xcite , while the emc resolution is 700 ps . as a result",
    ", the tof analysis provides @xmath15-@xmath16 separation to 1.5 gev / c ; the emc analysis , to 0.7 gev / c . due to geometric and acceptance effects",
    "the tof analysis consists of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) pairs of identified @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) while the emc analysis consists of approximately five times as many pairs .",
    "the particle identification algorithm is similar in both analyses .",
    "a pion is defined as being within 2@xmath21 of the pion mass - squared peak but 3@xmath21 away from the kaon peak .",
    "backgrounds from long lived resonances , e.g. @xmath22 s , are reduced by intradetector association cuts .",
    "energy deposition cuts in the tof slat or emc tower further reduce backgrounds due to accidental misassociations .",
    "systematic studies have shown that the background contamination to the emc analysis is at least double that in the tof analysis leading to artificially lower @xmath23 values in the former .",
    "ongoing studies of the backgrounds in the analyses aim to resolve these differences .",
    "however , the introduction of background from accidental hits or electron contamination tend to only affect the resulting @xmath23 in the fits and do not change the measured radii .",
    "a number of systematic studies have been performed to ensure that the resulting correlation function does not include any artificial , experimentally induced correlations from inefficiencies in either the detector or tracking algoithms . to remove these inefficiencies , pairs of particles within 2 cm of each other in the drift chamber",
    "are removed .",
    "further , pairs that share the same tof slat or emc cluster are also removed in both the signal and mixed background . for the coulomb correction ,",
    "the source is parameterized as a gaussian in r@xmath24= @xmath25 , as determined by an iterative procedure @xcite .",
    ".results of the bertsch - pratt fits to the identical pion pairs in the emc and tof analyses . errors shown represent statistical uncertainties only ; current systematic uncertainties are @xmath26 fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : memc ] shows the coulomb corrected correlation function for @xmath27 pairs measured in the emc analysis overlayed with the resulting fit . while the fit is performed in the full three dimensional space , we plot here projections of the correlation function into each of the standard momentum difference variables ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in table [ tab : results ] along with the results from the @xmath28 analysis from the emc and the @xmath19/@xmath20 analyses utilizing the tof .",
    "the mean transverse momentum ( @xmath29 ) of the pairs is 350 mev / c in the tof analysis and 340 mev / c in the emc analysis while the rapidity coverage in both analyses is centered about mid - rapidity , @xmath30 .",
    "the mean centrality of all pairs in the analysis is @xmath31% and is strongly biased towards central collisions .    within the current statistical and systematic error bars , the emc and tof analyses for both pion sets",
    "are consistent with one another .",
    "the results of the fits are moderately larger than identical measurements for au+au and pb+pb collisions at lower energies and comparable @xmath32 @xcite",
    ". the results do not indicate an especially large source compared to measurements at lower energies and the resulting naively calculated lifetime deduced from these measurements is consistent with zero .",
    "however , a stronger collective flow will shorten the effective source and lifetime measured by hbt .",
    "plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt ] is the @xmath32 dependence of the radii in the emc @xmath19 ( squares ) and @xmath20 ( triangles ) analyses .",
    "the sample is split into three approximately equal subsets of pairs and the correlation analysis is performed on each subset .",
    "the @xmath0 bins are @xmath33 mev / c , @xmath34 mev / c and @xmath35 mev / c corresponding to @xmath36 mev / c , @xmath37 mev / c and @xmath38 mev / c respectively .",
    "data points at identical @xmath32 are offset by @xmath39 mev / c for clarification .",
    "the radii follow trends familiar from lower energy measurements at lower beam energies @xcite : @xmath12 has a mild , if any , dependence on the transverse momentum of the pair , while @xmath13 varies strongly with @xmath32 .",
    "such dependencies have been described by collective motions , though temperature gradients and decays of short - lived resonances could also contribute to such dependencies @xcite .",
    "we have shown first measurements of identical pion correlations measured by phenix at rhic .",
    "the resulting bertsch - pratt radii are moderately larger than those measured at lower energies .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the radii is consistent with the conjecture of a system with a large degree of collective motion .",
    "an extension of these measurements over an wider range in @xmath0 with a larger data sample will be available following the upcoming 2001 data collection . during this second run the additional phenix acceptance and integrated luminosity should lead to approximately a factor of a hundred in pair statistics . the resulting data sample will lead to much stricter constraints on models of the collision and allow for comparisons to identical kaon and proton hbt analyses .",
