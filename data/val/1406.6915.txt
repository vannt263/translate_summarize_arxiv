    "for instance , coherent backscattering ( cbs ) and weak localization @xcite are due to the interference of mutually time reversed paths .",
    "similarly , coherent forward scattering is caused by the concatenation of two such processes , or again by the interference of two self retracing loops traversed in different order @xcite , etc .",
    "quantum coherent contributions are often discriminated from classical background contributions by their strong sensitivity to dephasing and decoherence",

    "external magnetic fields , ac electromagnetic radiation , etc .",
    " do not provide much insight into the mechanisms of quantum interference in disordered media .",
    "furthermore , decoherence often acts as a source of heating ( it certainly does so on the temperature scales relevant to cold atomic gases ) and leads to an unwelcome nonequilibrium shake - up of the system .    in this paper , we suggest an alternative protocol for probing quantum coherence .",
    "its advantage is that it offers much more specific information and at the same time is less intrusive than persistent external irradiation .",
    "the idea is to expose the quantum system to a source of dephasing only at specific ` signal times ' , @xmath0 .",
    "the system then responds to this perturbation at ` echo times ' @xmath1 , which are in well - defined correspondence to the signal times .",
    "each of these echoes corresponds to a specific mechanism of quantum - coherent scattering .",
    "for example , an echo at time @xmath2 after a dephasing pulse applied at time @xmath3 is a tell - tale signature of the cbs effect ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] below ) . likewise , an echo observed at time @xmath4 in response to _ two _ pulses at @xmath3 and @xmath5 identifies a contribution to forward scattering coherence , etc .",
