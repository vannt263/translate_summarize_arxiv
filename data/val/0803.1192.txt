    "this work provides some results about the description of trajectories of a particle in a model that presents fermi acceleration .",
    "this acceleration mechanism was originally proposed in 1949 by enrico fermi @xcite to provide an explanation for presence in the universe of high energy particles known as cosmic rays .",
    "such particles are believed to gain energy by consecutive interactions with irregularities in an otherwise stationary magnetic field .",
    "navely one would expect that a process of thermalization would occur , leading to a stationary motion of the particle itself .",
    "however , this reasoning turns out to be too simplistic and a more refined analysis shows that there is a definite probability of an average gain in energy . + in 1961 , ulam @xcite suggested a simple hamiltonian system to model such statistical acceleration behaviour . the model has been thereafter known as the _ fermi - ulam ping - pong model _ and consists of a particle moving between two infinite walls that are performing an oscillatory motion ; the particle changes its velocity only by elastic collisions with the moving walls and it is not subject to any other force .",
    "the main questions about this problem regarded the existence of trajectories with unbounded energy : such orbits can either be _ escaping _",
    ", i.e. such that the energy of the particle goes to infinity with time , or _ oscillating _ , meaning that the @xmath0 of energy is infinite while the @xmath1 remains bounded . in 1977",
    ", kam theory has been used to provide ( @xcite , @xcite ) the answers to such questions : for sufficiently smooth motions of the wall , all orbits are bounded , as there are invariant tori for high energies that prevent diffusion .",
    "it is interesting to note that the smoothness condition is not a mere technical issue as for less regular motions one can find ( many ) unbounded orbits ; see for instance @xcite . + a variation on",
    "the same theme involves a single oscillating wall and a potential @xmath2 to bring the particle back to the wall .",
    "this model allows for more flexibility as we can vary the potential that acts on the particle .",
    "the case of gravity potential ( @xmath3 ) has been investigated @xcite and the study yielded the following result :    there is an open set of wall motions @xmath4 ( in the space of periodic analytic functions admitting an analytic continuation to a given strip @xmath5 ) such that the measure of the _ escaping _ orbits is infinite .",
    "the case of elastic potential ( @xmath6 ) has been studied as well in @xcite , @xcite ; abundance of unbounded escaping orbits has been proved under some resonance condition between the motion of the wall and the potential .",
    "+ in a more general setting we can again use kam theory @xcite to prove the following result :    if @xmath7 but @xmath8 and the motion of the wall is smooth enough , then the set of escaping and oscillatory motions is empty as there is persistence of invariant tori for high energies .    on the other hand , orbits with unbounded energy",
    "are allowed for weaker potentials .",
    "it is conjectured that for potentials weaker than gravity ( i.e. for @xmath9 ) the measure of escaping motions is zero .",
    "a first step towards this result is the following    if @xmath10 and the motion of the wall is a sinusoid , then the set of escaping orbits has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "the above results leave several open questions regarding the largeness of the following sets :    * the escaping set @xmath11 i.e. the set of orbits such that energy tends to infinity as time grows ; * the set of orbits with bounded energy ; * the oscillatory set i.e. the set of orbits such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper we consider a static wall approximation to the bouncing ball system .",
    "this approximation , described in more detail in section [ approx ] , is widely used in physics literature .",
    "it has the advantage of being given by more simple and explicit formulae whereas keeping all essential geometrical features of the complete model .",
    "the first result of this paper is the following    if @xmath9 and the motion of the plate is a sinusoid , then the escaping set @xmath11 has full hausdorff dimension .    as a matter of fact",
    "we still ignore what should be the measure of the escaping set @xmath11 in the case @xmath14 .",
    "the proof for the @xmath10 case proceeds by defining a so - called _ critical set _ @xmath15 of finite mass for some invariant measure , and such that almost every orbit passes infinitely many times through @xmath15 ; applying poincar recurrence theorem to the first return map to @xmath15 gives the desired result .",
    "the key ingredient of the proof is that orbits outside @xmath15 are strongly hyperbolic .",
    "the set @xmath15 has infinite measure for @xmath16 , therefore we aim to better understand dynamics on @xmath15 in order to obtain a smaller set @xmath17 of finite measure with the same recurrence property . as a first step we study elliptic islands inside @xmath15 ;",
    "more exactly we establish some results about the abundance of elliptic islands for high energies :    let @xmath9 .",
    "then in the static wall approximation , for _ almost all _ sinusoidal motions there are elliptic islands of period 2 for arbitrarily high energies .",
    "moreover if @xmath18 we can prove the same result for _ all _ sinusoidal motions .    as a byproduct of the construction involved in the proof of theorem b",
    "we obtain conditions on @xmath19 for which the total measure of elliptic islands of fixed period 2 is either infinite or finite .",
    "we remark that theorem a extends without difficulties to the non - approximated bouncing balls system as we will briefly explain at the end of section [ hausdorffdimension ] .",
    "we also expect theorem b to remain valid for the exact bouncing ball system , but the computations needed to verify this statement are quite cumbersome .",
    "questions regarding existence and abundance of oscillatory orbits are still completely open .",
    "we consider the problem of a point mass bouncing vertically on an infinitely heavy horizontal plate which oscillates with period 1 in the vertical direction and interacts with the particle by the law of elastic reflection .",
    "the particle is moving in a potential @xmath2 , where @xmath20 is the vertical position and @xmath19 is some positive real number . + let @xmath4 be the vertical position of the plate at time @xmath21 , periodic of period 1 ; for simplicity we will consider the case : @xmath22 it is natural to associate to the system a discrete time map defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath23 be the time of the @xmath24st collision between the plate and the particle and @xmath25 its velocity ( pointing upwards ) immediately after the collision . as the position of the plate is a 1-periodic function of time @xmath21 we can consider @xmath23 on @xmath26 .",
    "in this way the phase space is a half cylinder , as the velocity immediately after a collision at time @xmath21 has to satisfy the inequality @xmath27 .",
    "+ an approximation common to this kind of problems is the so - called _ static wall approximation _ , in which one considers the plate fixed at position @xmath28 but exchanging momentum with the particle as if it were moving .",
    "notice that since the displacement of the plate is a bounded quantity , it affects the map by terms of order at most @xmath29 , i.e. the accuracy of the approximation increases for high energies .",
    "+ define @xmath30 as the time taken by a ball leaving @xmath31 with upward velocity @xmath32 to return on @xmath31 subject to the potential @xmath33 . in our case @xmath34 , where it is easy to check that @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , let @xmath36 be the energy of the particle after the collision : @xmath37 performing the change of variable @xmath38 we obtain : @xmath39 notice that the asymptotic expression is exact for @xmath40 or @xmath3 .",
    "+ we will study the system in the static wall approximation and considering @xmath41 . in this setting the map @xmath42 can be written as : @xmath43 note that if we consider @xmath44 rather than @xmath32 as the fundamental variable we obtain : @xmath45 this map resembles the standard map , with the perturbation parameter @xmath46 depending on @xmath32 .",
    "we can distinguish between the following cases :    * _ weak potentials _",
    "@xmath47 : the perturbation parameter grows as velocity grows ; we expect diffusion to high energies ; * _ gravity _ @xmath48 : the system is equivalent to the standard map ( unfolded on a semi - cylinder along @xmath32 ) ; * _ strong potentials _",
    "@xmath49 : the perturbation parameter decreases as we increase energy ; there is persistence of invariant tori for high energies and therefore we can not have diffusion to arbitrarily high energies ; * _ elastic potential _",
    "@xmath50 : the period @xmath51 is independent of @xmath32 , this is an exceptional case ; * _ strong potentials ( ii ) _ @xmath52 : high energies correspond to small @xmath51 , therefore we recover once more invariant tori bounding energies from above ; * _ fermi - ulam ping pong _",
    "@xmath53 : limit case of strong potentials ; once more high energies are bounded by invariant tori .",
    "notice that in this case the static wall approximation is not anymore a good approximation as we would neglect term of the same order as @xmath51 .",
    "we will prove our results for the map ( [ mainapprox ] ) in the weak potentials regime .",
    "we recall the definition of hausdorff dimension of a metric space .",
    "first we need to define the _ hausdorff @xmath54-measure _ of a metric space @xmath55 as : @xmath56 then we define the _ hausdorff dimension _ of @xmath55 as that critical @xmath54 such that : @xmath57 it can be actually proved that if @xmath58 then @xmath59 ; moreover , hausdorff dimension is a bilipschitz invariant of metric spaces . +",
    "now let @xmath11 be the set of escaping points , i.e. @xmath60    if @xmath9 and @xmath4 is given by equation , then @xmath61 .",
    "the actual proof will be provided in the two following subsections ; hereby we outline all necessary steps . as in @xcite we define a set @xmath15 such that orbits avoiding this set are hyperbolic ; we will then consider a curve @xmath62 obtained as a graph of a function of @xmath21 , transverse to the stable direction on hyperbolic points .",
    "the core of the proof lies in proposition [ hausdim ] and lemma [ reduction ] which prove that @xmath63 ; using transversality to stable directions we obtain the desired result @xmath61 . as trivially @xmath64 , it suffices to obtain the reverse inequality ; such lower bound will be found by bounding the dimension of a subset containing all trajectories such that the particle gain at least energy @xmath65 on all ( but a finite number ) of collisions .",
    "the latter subset can in turn be expressed as the limit inferior of all preimages of the set of trajectories for which we gain energy at least @xmath65 on the first collision .",
    "+ let @xmath66 be the projection from the phase space onto the time coordinate @xmath21 and let @xmath67 be the parametrization of @xmath62 that is a section for @xmath66 , i.e. : @xmath68 we are going to consider the sequence of maps of @xmath69 to itself defined by the following composition : @xmath70 the proof of the result for this sequence of maps relies on the fact that on the hyperbolic set the map @xmath71 is expanding along @xmath62 ( and its images ) with an expanding rate that increases with energy ; since we are looking for points belonging to the escaping set , velocity will grow along with @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we need to bound the dimension of the intersection of all preimages of a fixed set by a sequence of expanding map which expansion rates are diverging .",
    "in such a setting we mimic the calculation of the hausdorff dimension of the usual middle third cantor set . roughly speaking one",
    "can define a @xmath73-cantor set by dividing the unit interval in a number of equal pieces @xmath72 , removing @xmath74 of them and then iterating the procedure on the @xmath75 leftover intervals .",
    "the dimension of the set obtained in this way is well - known to be : @xmath76 notice that if @xmath72 and @xmath75 grow while their ratio remains bounded , the above formula for @xmath77 approaches 1 ; the same conclusion holds true if we let @xmath72 and @xmath75 grow to infinity as we iterate the building procedure .",
    "another way to define such cantor sets is to obtain them as intersection of preimages of a given set under an expanding map of the interval ; for example the classic middle third cantor set might be obtained by taking the intersection of all preimages of the set @xmath78\\cup[2/3,1]$ ] under the map @xmath79 .",
    "if we let the expansion rate grow along with @xmath72 we obtain once more a set of hausdorff dimension 1 . to conclude the proof we bound in a _",
    "bilipshitz _ fashion the sequence of maps @xmath80 between two sequences of linear expanding maps whose expansion rates are increasing , and then obtain the corresponding estimate for the hausdorff dimension of the set of escaping orbits .",
    "+ in the next subsection we will prove our result for a model system ; in the subsequent subsection we will show that the original system can be reduced to such model system .",
    "our model system will be a sequence of continuous functions @xmath81 , such that any lift @xmath82 satisfies the following inequalities for all real @xmath83 : @xmath84 now define @xmath85 . then clearly we have : @xmath86 for each @xmath72 we can decompose @xmath69 as a disjoint union of intervals of the form @xmath87 such that @xmath88 is 1 - 1 and onto @xmath69 on each of such intervals .",
    "each interval corresponds to a different choice of an inverse function for @xmath88 . in order to choose an inverse function for @xmath88 we have to choose an inverse branch for each one of the @xmath89 of which",
    "@xmath88 is the composition .",
    "in such a way we obtain a natural labeling for the inverse branches of @xmath71 where we write : @xmath90 and each @xmath91 runs on all different inverse branches of @xmath89 .     for @xmath92.,height=151 ]",

    "[ hausdim ]    in order to compute @xmath102 we will consider a smaller subset @xmath103",

    "define @xmath109 ; then , assuming we already defined @xmath110 and recalling that @xmath111we define the decreasing sequence : @xmath112 where the union is taken _ only _ over intervals which _ fully intersect _ @xmath110 , i.e. all intervals that are not truncated by the intersection .",
    "in other words : each set @xmath113 is the union of many intervals ; some of these intervals are completely contained in @xmath110 , and such intervals will be called _ good _ intervals and belong to what we will call _ good _ branches .",

    "moreover the number @xmath130 of intervals present in @xmath104 is easily obtained by the previous inductive procedure : @xmath131 @xmath132 with a slight abuse of notation we will write from now on @xmath133 where now each @xmath134 is running over just the good branches .",
