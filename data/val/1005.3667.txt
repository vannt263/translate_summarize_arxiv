    "the polar regions of the sun have some distinct properties compared with those of the quiet sun : ( 1 ) the coronal holes in the polar regions are extended and stationary , ( 2 ) the fast solar wind emanates from the polar region , ( 3 ) the meridional flow may reach the polar regions , which must have a sink for the flow coming to the polar regions , and ( 4 ) the global poloidal magnetic field of the sun manifests itself in the polar regions .",
    "therefore , information on the magnetic properties of the polar regions is critically important for the understanding of the solar dynamo problem .",
    "the acceleration mechanism of the fast solar wind must also be related to the spatial and temporal structures of magnetic fields on the surface of the sun , and the physical process creating the wind is still a topic of debate @xcite .",
    "the polar regions have been observed with ground - based magnetograms @xcite .",
    "these observations as well as observations with _",
    "soho / mdi _ @xcite have provided measurements of the line - of - sight magnetic component . for more accurate observations ,",
    "full stokes polarimetry for the polar regions has been carried out @xcite , but because of the strong intensity gradient and the foreshortening effect at the solar limb , the spatial resolution of the ground - based measurements has been compromised .",
    "the magnetic properties of the polar region are poorly understood .",
    "@xcite found with _ hinode _",
    "@xcite that there are patchy concentrations of magnetic fields with field strengths exceeding 1 kg in the polar region , confirming the result of @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields are almost _ vertical _ to the local surface of the sun .",
    "ubiquitous magnetic concentrations with field strengths larger than 1 kg are known to exist in the quiet sun as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this paper focuses on determining whether there is any difference in the magnetic properties between the polar region and the quiet sun . if there is a difference , what is the implication to the problems of solar dynamo and the acceleration of the fast solar wind ? with this motivation , we observed the polar region and the quiet sun as a fiducial data for the analysis of the polar region with the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) @xcite of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) @xcite aboard _ hinode_.    the sensitivity to a given magnetic field vector depends on its orientation with respect to the observer and on the stokes parameter used to detect it",

    "v _ is more sensitive than that through stokes _",
    "q _ and _ u _ when the field is weak .",
    "we observed the quiet sun located at the east limb instead of the quiet sun at the disk center , so that the sensitivity to detect any weak magnetic field is the same for both the polar region and the quiet sun .",
    "this allows a direct comparison between the polarimetric data for the polar region with that for the quiet sun .",

    "the sp observed a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath1 in a very - deep - map mode ( exposure time : 12.8 s ) .",
    "the sp records the stokes spectral profiles ( _ i , q , u _ and _ v _ ) of fe i 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm with a wavelength sampling of 2.15 pm @xmath2 and with a scan step of 0.16@xmath3 .",
    "a least - squares fitting was applied to the stokes spectra with the milne - eddington inversion of the polarized spectra ( milos ) code @xcite .",

    "a nonzero stray - light factor @xmath6 may be interpreted as a parameter that represents both the filling factor of a nonmagnetized atmosphere along the line of sight and the stray - light contamination .",
    "the stray - light profile is evaluated individually for each pixel as the average of the stokes i profiles observed in a @xmath7 wide box centered on the pixel @xcite .",
    "this arrangement also allows us to accurately estimate the stray - light profiles of rapidly changing continuum intensity toward the limb .    to minimize the influence of noise leading to unreliable inversions",
    ", we analyze only pixels whose linear or circular polarization signal amplitudes exceed a given threshold above the noise level @xmath8 .",
    "the noise level @xmath8 is determined in the continuum wavelength range of the stokes _ q , u _ and _ v _ profiles .",
    "the noise level @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the intensity of the stokes v profile at continuum wavelength pixel @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the average stokes v signal for the same wavelength range , and @xmath13 is the number of wavelength data points .",
    "@xmath14 depends on the exposure time , where @xmath15 is the continuum intensity , and is 0.0008 for the observation of the north polar region .",
    "the fitting was performed for pixels whose _ q , u _ or _ v _",
    "peak is larger than @xmath16 .",
    "the derived maps still contain pixels with physically unacceptable values . if there is a strong spike on top of the noisy stokes profiles ( due to poisson fluctuation and cosmic ray hits ) exceeding the threshold , that pixel will pass the 5@xmath8 criteria .",
    "this is the reason why we can not completely remove the bad pixels .",
    "thus , we employ an additional filter to further remove the influence of the noise .",
    "we improved the statistics of the stokes profiles by summing across 2 pixels in wavelength , and then removed the pixels whose _ q , u _ or _",
    "peak in the summed profiles is lower than @xmath17 .",
    "all the good profiles that have passed the previous threshold should pass this criterion too : only the noisy profiles with high spike which have cheated the prior filter can be potentially removed in this stage .",
    "note that we use the original stokes profiles ( not summed ) for inversion .",
    "furthermore , we remove pixels with the absolute value of the doppler velocity higher than 10 km s@xmath18 _ or _ the filling factor less than 0.01 .",
    "analysis of several samples indicates that the stokes profiles of such pixels are not fitted well .",
    "the velocity of the horizontal flow due to granular motion observed with sot / sp is smaller than 9 km s@xmath18 @xcite , and the threshold of 10 km s@xmath18 employed here is above this value .",
    "if the stray - light contamination is negligible , the filling factor of the magnetic atmosphere will be given by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the distribution of the filling factor @xmath20 has a broad peak at @xmath21 with fwhm range @xmath22 for another polar region , and the threshold given above for the filling factor is located far away from the typical range .",
    "even if we erroneously remove valid pixels with this filter , the effect of the erroneous removal would be negligible , since the total number of pixels removed with this particular process is only 1.7% of the total number of pixels that passed the previous two criteria .",
    "a total of 21.0% of the pixels pass all the thresholds .",
    "figure [ npole2 ] shows a map of the magnetic field strength as seen from just above the north pole . such a polar projection is needed to correctly see the spatial extent and size distribution of magnetic patches in the polar region .",
    "note that at a higher latitude the spatial resolution in one direction is compromised due to the projection effect .",
    "large patches correspond to the kilo - gauss magnetic fields with the fanning - out structure @xcite .",
    "the inclination ( zenith ) angle of the magnetic field vector with respect to the local normal has a wide distribution with two peaks around the local vertical and the local horizontal directions @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in any difference between the polar region and the quiet sun , and the resulting consequence in the coronal magnetic fields , we obtain the zenith angle _",
    "i _ of the magnetic field vector .",
    "due to the @xmath23 ambiguity in the direction of the magnetic field vector projected onto the sky plane , there are two solutions @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; fig . [ incli1 ] ) given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angle between the local normal and the line - of - sight , and",

    "[ incli1 ] , and is given by @xmath37 .",
    "we now introduce one assumption that the magnetic field vector is either _ vertical _ or _ horizontal _ to the local surface ( or undetermined ) .",
    "the zenith angle is defined to be from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and from @xmath40 to @xmath23 for the _ vertical _ magnetic field .",
    "the zenith angle of the _ horizontal _ field is defined to be between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , following @xcite .",
    "magnetic field vectors with an inclination angle between 40@xmath43 and 70@xmath43 are not used in the subsequent analysis . according to this definition , every pixel has magnetic field vector classified as either _ vertical _ or _ horizontal _ ( or undetermined ) .",
    "figure [ incli2 ] shows the scatter plots of the two solutions @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the zenith angle .",
    "if both the solutions are vertical , the one closer to the local normal is taken . in case",
    "one solution is vertical and the other horizontal , it is not possible to distinguish one from each other .",
    "pixels with those solutions are not used .",
    "if one of the solutions is either vertical or horizontal , and the other solution is neither vertical nor horizontal , we will choose the solution of either vertical or horizontal .",
    "in addition , the kg - patches with quasi - symmetric fanning - out structure allows us to manually correct the zenith angle by visually inspecting the thus - determined zenith angle map .",
    "there is concentration of pixels ( about 3% of the pixels ) along the white line of @xmath44 in figure [ incli2 ] .",
    "these pixels along the line have only valid stokes v signal without stokes q and u signals .",
    "the inversion code correctly produces either @xmath45 or @xmath46 for these pixels , so that @xmath44 from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . there is a gap in population around the line @xmath47 .",
    "if the inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is @xmath48 , i.e. the magnetic field vector is on the sky plane , it turns out that @xmath47 from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "there may be two reasons for the gap : ( 1 ) the noise in stokes v makes the derived magnetic vector impossible to reach an inclination of @xmath49 ( ie .",
    "the sky plane ) .",
    "( 2 ) stokes v is much more sensitive than stokes q and v for weak magnetic field strength , so that the magnetic field vectors tend to deviate the sky plane .",
    "it is possible to check the consistency of the @xmath23 ambiguity resolution done here with the information on the sign of the stokes v signal @xcite .",
    "we compare the polarity of the magnetic field vectors classified as _ vertical _ shown in figure [ npole3 ] with the stokes v map such as the one shown in figure 2 of @xcite , and confirm that 96% of the pixels shown in fig .",
    "[ npole3 ] has the correct sign indicated by the polarity of the stokes v signal .",
    "in particular , we confirm that all the apparent kg - patches have the correct sign .",

    ".      two maps of the strengths of the magnetic field vectors classified as _",
    "vertical _ and _ horizontal _ for the north polar region are shown in figure [ npole3 ] .",
    "comparison of figure [ npole2 ] with two panels of figure [ npole3 ] shows that the vertical and horizontal magnetic fields are well decoupled : for instance , we do not see any inclined fanning - out structure around the magnetic concentrations of the vertical magnetic fields in the map of the horizontal magnetic fields due to the separation band prepared in between the vertical and horizontal zones in the inclination of the magnetic field vectors .    as for the vertical magnetic fields ,",
    "almost all the large patches have the same polarity , while both polarities exist for the smaller patches .",
    "there appears to be more mixed polarities in lower latitude , while the region in higher latitude is dominated by negative kg patches .",
    "the horizontal magnetic fields appear to be much more uniform in size and in spatial distribution as compared with the vertical magnetic fields .",

    "although the vertical magnetic flux in the polar region is larger than that of the quiet sun , the horizontal magnetic flux in the polar region is remarkably similar to that of the quiet region .",
    "the small difference between the two results ( 98% in the present paper and 93% in @xcite at 700 g ) could be due to the following two factors : ( 1 ) a higher atmosphere is observed in the limb observations , so that the measured magnetic field strength may be smaller in the limb observations .",
    "( 2 ) the horizontal magnetic fields are observed through stokes q and u in the disk center observations , while stokes v is involved in the limb observations .",
    "thus , the limb observations may have higher sensitivity to the horizontal magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite proposed that a local dynamo process be uniformly operating in the photosphere or below based on the observations that the probability distribution function of the transient horizontal magnetic fields in the quiet sun is the same as that in a plage region .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic properties of the quiet sun in the disk center analyzed by @xcite are the same as those of the quiet sun at the east limb analyzed in this paper , we would conclude that the distribution function of the horizontal magnetic fields and the amount of the magnetic flux are exactly the same in the quiet sun , a plage region and in the polar region .",
    "this provides firmer evidence that a local dynamo process driven by the granular motion is responsible for the generation of the horizontal magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite obtained the temperatures and the densities of the polar coronal hole and the quiet sun with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) @xcite aboard _",
    "hinode_. these are the most accurate measurements carried out using the broadband filters by correcting for the effect of scattered x - rays with the lunar occultation .",
    "the temperatures and electron densities then derived are 1.0 mk and 1.0@xmath661.5 @xmath90 for the polar coronal hole , and 1.5@xmath662.0 mk and 2.0@xmath663.0 @xmath91 for the quiet sun .",
    "the plasma pressures are 1.4@xmath662.1 @xmath92 and 4.1@xmath668.3 @xmath92 for the coronal hole and the quiet sun , respectively .",
    "thus , plasma pressure in the coronal hole is a factor of 3@xmath666 smaller than that of the quiet sun .",
    "the coronal hole in the upper corona inside the alfvnic sphere should have collapsed due to the lateral pressure from the surrounding quiet sun corona , if the magnetic field strength in the polar coronal hole is much smaller than that of the quiet corona .",
    "the polar coronal hole is stable for a long time , and the coronal hole and the surrounding corona of the quiet sun must be in pressure equilibrium . in this paper",
    ", we showed that the magnetic flux of the polar region in the photosphere is larger than that in the quiet sun ( fig .",
    "[ pdf ] ) . indeed , magnetic pressure estimated from fig .",
    "[ brbh ] is 1 dyn cm@xmath88 in the polar region and @xmath94 dyn cm@xmath88 above the quiet sun at the height of @xmath95 km .",
    "the boundary of the polar coronal hole and the quiet sun must be determined by the total pressure balance between the coronal hole and the corona in the quiet sun , and the polar corona expands to the lower latitude until it reaches the magnetic plus plasma pressure equilibrium with the quiet sun corona .",
    "this may be the reason why the fast solar wind from the polar region reaches the lower latitude @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the correlation between solar plumes and polar magnetic field with _",
    "soho _ , and found that there is opposite magnetic flux close to the foot - point of solar plumes . in the polar coronal hole , x - ray jets are observed with high occurrence rate ( 60 polar x - ray jets per day on average ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite revealed that the opposite magnetic fields close to the kg - patches are related to the occurrence of the x - ray jets .",
    "distribution of such opposite magnetic fields around a kg - patch is indeed seen in the ( signed ) magnetic field map in the north polar region ( fig .",
    "[ npole3 ] ) , and may be responsible for various coronal activities .",
