    "electrons confined in narrow one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels occupy discrete energy levels or subbands , causing the measured conductance to be quantized in units of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "interactions between the electrons give rise to an anomalous feature near @xmath4 , the `` 0.7 structure / anomaly ''  @xcite .",
    "consensus about the origin of the 0.7 anomaly has not yet been reached  @xcite , and it has been attributed to various causes .",
    "these include spontaneous spin polarization  @xcite , the kondo effect  @xcite , wigner crystallisation  @xcite , and inelastic scattering combined with a smeared van hove singularity in the density of states  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in distinguishing between different scenarios arises in part from understanding how the 0.7 anomaly is governed by specific factors .",
    "its behavior as a function of temperature @xmath1 and magnetic field @xmath2 is well established : the 0.7 structure becomes more pronounced as @xmath1 increases ( while higher plateaus are smeared by thermal effects ) , and evolves into a plateau at @xmath5 with increasing @xmath2 , as the 1d subbands are split by the zeeman energy .",
    "the evolution of the 0.7 structure as a function of carrier density and 1d channel geometry is not well established . as carrier density",
    "is reduced , the 0.7 structure has been shown to evolve from @xmath4 to @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "however , other studies report more complex behavior , with the 0.7 structure rising and/or lowering in conductance as carrier density increases @xcite . in addition , the only studies of the 0.7 structure as a function of device geometry have shown opposite trends @xcite , or no clear dependence @xcite .",
    "the possible interplay between channel length and carrier density further complicates the interpretation of experimental results .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a solution to the apparent conflict between reports on the density dependence of the 0.7 structure .",
    "contrary to what is widely assumed in the literature , we believe that it is the field profile , rather than carrier density , that dictates the behavior of the 0.7 structure at constant temperature and in zero magnetic field . more specifically , the primary variable appears to be the longitudinal curvature of the one - dimensional barrier .",
    "this hitherto unreported observation is made possible by the use of two recently - developed experimental methods .",
    "the first , multiplexing  @xcite , enables a statistical analysis on the characteristics of 98 split gates within the same cooldown ( the largest reported study in one - dimensional transport ) .",
    "the second is a data analysis tool that removes the trivial geometry dependence of the conductance , leaving only the contribution of electron - electron interactions .",

    "although we can not at this moment rule out any models of the 0.7 structure / anomaly , we can however formulate a quantitative predictive test which could discriminate between such models .",
    "studies of transport in split gates have so far relied on measuring individual devices , and reproducing the result in a few others .",
    "an entirely different approach is presented here : large numbers of devices are measured in a single cooldown and trends are observed in the combined data .",
    "this is achieved using a multiplexing technique  @xcite , which overcomes limitations on the number of devices that can be located on a single chip and measured in cryogenic apparatus .",

    "the 0.7 structure is present in all 98 split gates measured but gives rise to a minimum in @xmath107 for only approximately one third of the data ( 36 devices ) ; @xmath106 could be estimated only when the 0.7 structure is very pronounced .",

    "in summary , we have used a multiplexing technique to systematically study the effect of device geometry on the 0.7 anomaly .",
