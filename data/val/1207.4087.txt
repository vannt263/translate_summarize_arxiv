    "the underlying principles of many quantum information protocols can be traced back to the concept of quantum random walk ( qrw ) , which since its first description have become a fundamental paradigm in quantum science @xcite .",
    "the idea of qrws was originally conceived by aharonov _",
    "@xcite as an extension of the well - known classical random walk ( crw ) @xcite .",
    "the main distinguishing feature of a qrw , compare to a crw , is the possibility of interference between the multiple paths that can be simultaneously traversed by a quantum walker , enabling thus a faster spreading of the uncertainty of location of the walker than in the classical case @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of a quantum system , such as a qrw , depends on the presence , and specific characteristics , of the environmental effects ( decoherence ) which can modify it @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the influence of decoherence during the evolution of a quantum walker transforms an originally pure state into a mixed state , lowering the uncertainty about the location of the walker as it propagates . in the limiting case , when all cross - interference terms between different lattice sites are completely erased ,",
    "the state of pure diffusive classical propagation is reached @xcite .",
    "qrws have been theoretically explored for the case of one - dimensional lattices @xcite , and experimentally implemented by means of different physical platforms , such as photon - based systems @xcite , optical lattices @xcite and waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "also , qrws have been implemented using trapped ions @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite .",
    "although the implementation of one - dimensional qrws has showed to be useful when describing several quantum information systems , there is a great interest in expanding the concept to multidimensional lattices . along these lines ,",
    "two - dimensional qrws provide a powerful tool for modeling complex quantum information and energy transport systems @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , their realization represents a challenge because of the need of a four - level coin operation @xcite .",
    "one way to overcome this drawback is to make use of different degrees of freedom of photons , such as polarization and orbital angular momentum , as it has been shown in @xcite .",
    "another approach is to mimic the two - dimensional qrws evolution by performing two subsequent one - dimensional qrws @xcite .    here , we make use of the latter approach to put forward an experimental setup for the realization of two - dimensional qrws .",
    "we include the environmental effects ( decoherence ) as pure dephasing by means of the introduction of random phase patterns , generated by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , which can be different from site to site ( _ spatial disorder _ ) . by controlling the degree of decoherence",
    ", we study the transition from the quantum ballistic spreading to the diffusive classical walk .",
    "also , by adding static disorder , we show the possibility of observing anderson localization @xcite .",
    "importantly , our proposal provides a versatile , highly - scalable experimental setup , which may be used as a tool for understanding quantum processes whose underlying physics can be somehow traced to the concept of random walks , such as energy transport in photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes @xcite and material band gap structures @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the qrw model system , including dephasing , considered here",
    ". the proposed experimental setup is described in sec .",
    "numerical results are discussed in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in the conclusion .",
    "a typical discrete quantum random walk comprises two operations : a coin - tossing operation and a shift operation . here",
    ", the coin - tossing operation is performed in the hilbert space @xmath0 spanned by vectors @xmath1 , corresponding to the photon polarization .",
    "the random walk is performed in the hilbert space @xmath2 , corresponding to the position of the photon in the transverse plane , spanned by vectors @xmath3 ( @xmath4 integers ) , which indicate sites ( @xmath4 ) in the transverse plane ( @xmath5 . the global quantum system thus evolve in the hilbert space @xmath6    the state of the system is described by the density matrix @xmath7 , which is transformed to a new density matrix each step @xmath8 via the map @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the hadamard operator @xmath11 which acts on the polarization degree of freedom .",
    "the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which describe the walker s shift in the transverse dimensions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , independently , read as @xmath16 and @xmath17    the coupling of the quantum walker with the environment is described by pure dephasing @xcite .",
    "the form of the unitary dephasing operator considered here can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a random phase matrix and @xmath20 is the pauli operator .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) shows that @xmath19 represents a newly introduced phase difference between the horizontal and vertical polarizations at each site .",
    "concerning this , we will consider three physically relevant scenarios , that can be easily implemented in the set - up proposed here ( see sec .",
    "iii ) . in the general case ,",
    "the phase differences @xmath19 are independent random variables , but with the same probability distribution .",
    "moreover , the ensemble of phase differences @xmath19 can change from step @xmath8 to step @xmath21 . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this case as a qrw influenced by _",
    "dynamical spatial disorder_.        the easiest probability distribution that we can consider is an uniform probability distribution . if phases can be chosen arbitrarily between the extreme values @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "there is a constant probability @xmath24 to obtain any phase in this interval .",
    "@xmath25 is the maximal phase which we can have between the two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "@xmath26 corresponds to the absence of any spatial disorder . if phases do not change during propagation ,",
    "even though they might differ from site to site , i.e. @xmath27 , then we have _ static spatial disorder_. finally , if all phase differences are the same for all sites , but they can still change from one step to the following , we have _ dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder_.    the probability of detecting a photon in the site ( @xmath4 ) is @xmath28| i , j\\rangle , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where the density matrix that describes the whole system is traced out over the polarization degree of freedom @xmath29 .",
    "the spreading of the uncertainty of photon location is characterized by dependence of the variance on the step index n    @xmath30    where @xmath31 represents the lattice site with indexes ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath32 is the mean position , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "the main building block of the qrw setup is the multi - path mach - zehnder - like configuration shown in fig .",
    "1 . it allows to make several runs of the qrw without the necessity of using a large amount of optical components , as it is the case , for instance , of the experiment described in @xcite .",
    "a similar scheme , based on a single - path mach - zehnder - like configuration has been used @xcite . however in these cases , the walker moves in time , whereas in our proposal the walker moves in the two - dimensional transverse plane , offering a way to simplify the experimental implementation of the two - dimensional qrw .",
    "as source of photons one can use a highly attenuated short coherent pulse , prepared by the combination of a photon source and attenuator ( at ) , generating the initial state @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the central site .",
    "the duration of the pulse has to be sufficiently smaller than the time - of - fly through the setup in one cycle .",
    "the transverse size of the gaussian beam profile of the pulse has to be carefully chosen , so that two adjacent sites are not overlapping in the space due to diffraction .",
    "for instance , by making use of a gaussian beam of 2 mm beam waist , corresponding to a rayleigh range of 23.6 m ( for a wavelength @xmath36 = 532 nm ) , along with typical - sized optical components , we could in principle perform a qrw of approximately more than 20 steps .",
    "the number of steps can be further improved by applying smaller beams together with a re - focusing system placed along the walker s path .",
    "alternatively , a spontaneous parametric down - conversion source can be used , provided each down - converted photon is generated in a pure state .",
    "then , the photon is transmitted via the beam splitter ( bs ) to the system .    to get a clearer picture of the working of the quantum random",
    "walk , let us consider in detail the quantum state of the photon in its first passage through the system . first , the polarization state of the photon is changed by the half - wave plate ( hwp1 ) to @xmath37 $ ] , i.e. , the hadamard ( @xmath10 ) operation is applied . after this transformation , the photon is displaced by the horizontal beam displacer ( hbd ) along the @xmath14 axis according to its polarization , as described by the shift operator @xmath12 .",
    "the photon is now in the state @xmath38.$ ] a second half - wave plate ( hwp2 ) implements a new hadamard transformation , which transforms the quantum state to @xmath39 .",
    "the vertical beam displacer ( vbd ) shifts the position of the photon along the @xmath15 axis . after this",
    ", the quantum state of the photon reads    @xmath40 . \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the spatial light modulator ( slm ) is used to introduce random phases , given by the phase - matrix @xmath19 . after the photon passes through the slm , the whole cycle is repeated with high probability .",
    "if not , the photon escapes through the other output port of the beam - splitter , which directs it towards a highly sensitive ( single - photon sensitivity ) intensified ccd camera with integrated photo - multipliers , which allows to spatially resolve a weak signal with a high efficiency ( @xmath4190% ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , losses in the setup can be compensated by an increase of the amplitude of pulse .",
    "the size of whole array of beams can be reduced by an auxiliary imaging system in order to fit on the limited size of sensitive area of ccd .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig:5 ]    the photon position is less dramatic than in the case with dynamical spatial disorder . for the dynamical spatial disorder , @xmath42 for @xmath25 after 20 steps . on the contrary , for dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder , we have @xmath43 under the same conditions .",
    "indeed , the @xmath8-dependence of the typical deviation , characteristic of the classical regime , it is not yet reached after @xmath44 steps , as is readily observed in fig .",
    "4(b ) .      in the context of our discussion",
    ", the anderson localization is the reduction of spreading of the uncertainty of the photon position @xcite . we will demonstrate that this effect can also be observed in the set - up considered here . in @xcite , anderson localization was observed in the transverse plane of a light beam passing through a crystal with random static fluctuations of the index of refraction . since the randomness in the index of refraction is affecting only the phase of the propagating beam , it is possible to imitate these phase - fluctuations with a slm , under the consideration of static spatial disorder , since anderson localization does not appear with dynamical spatial disorder .    in fig .",
    "5(a ) we present a typical profile of the phase - matrix @xmath19 , independent of n , which leads to beam localization .",
    "5(b ) shows the corresponding probability distribution of the photon position for this specific phase profile .",
    "notice that it contains a strong peak located in the middle of the lattice .",
    "the presence of anderson localization is confirmed in fig .",
    "5(c ) , where we show the averaged probability distribution function for @xmath25 , exhibiting an exponential suppression of probabilities for sites distant from the center . for the sake of clarity , we also plotted in fig .",
    "5(d ) two cuts of the averaged probability distribution along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes , to highlight this feature .",
    "we have put forward a new , highly scalable and easily implemented experimental configuration to observe spatial two - dimensional random walks under a great variety of circumstances , by means of the implementation of two consecutive one - dimensional random walks .",
    "the proposal makes use of only a small amount of simple optics components , and allows us to simulate many different quantum systems and protocols based on the quantum random walk concept . additionally , by carefully controlling the amount and type of disorder present in the system",
    ", we have shown the effects of different environmental effects : dynamical spatial disorder , dynamical dephasing without spatial disorder and static spatial disorder .",
    "the last case drove us to the observation of anderson localization .",
    "the control of environmental effects is paramount importance in nearly all quantum systems . in some cases , it is even crucial to understand the dynamics experimentally observe .",
    "for instance , in light harvesting complexes @xcite , the interplay between coherent evolution and noise is a critical ingredient , which allows to obtain a high efficiency energy transport .",
