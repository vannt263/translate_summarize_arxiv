    "analytic solutions of the collective bohr - mottelson model @xcite received in the recent years a boost of innovative ideas such as the use of a deformation dependent mass term @xcite , interplay of various shape - phase conditions @xcite , inclusion of higher order multipole deformations @xcite as well as of the new solvable potentials @xcite . in this trend of alternative approaches",
    ", one can also include the adaptation of the formalism based on the energy dependent ( non - local ) potentials to the quadrupole collective excitations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that although the variation of the nuclear properties with the energy is a well established fact , the energy dependent potentials are poorly employed in nuclear physics , with only few notable applications regarding quark systems @xcite . on the other hand , some authors expended great effort to ensure the state independence of the potential @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the coupling constant of the potential , drastically changes the analytical properties of the associated eigensystem .",
    "therefore , introducing such a concept into the bohr hamiltonian must be made with care and with a sufficiently strong phenomenological motivation , because the potential energy depends in general on both shape variables @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "the complex collective motion can be exactly separated into a vibrational and rotational components when the potential energy is @xmath0-independent , due to the fact that the @xmath0 variable is coupled with the rotational degrees of freedom . in this case of @xmath0-unstable conditions",
    "the energy dependence of the potential is then strictly associated to the vibrational motion . on the other hand",
    ", the collective potential defines the nuclear shape , such that its energy dependence imply a shape instability which can be materialized in a shape coexistence @xcite .",
    "shape coexistence is usually marked by the existence of very closely positioned low energy states which correspond to different shapes .",
    "it must be understood that it is associated only to extremely distinct shapes such as for example spherical and axially deformed , prolate and oblate , highly separated prolate or oblate deformations .",
    "these combinations fit quite well in the @xmath0-unstable premise of the present approach whose prolate or oblate character is indeterminate .",
    "the bohr hamiltonian with a non - local potential was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case of the @xmath0-unstable five - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential with an increasing string constant with the energy of the system .",
    "the simplest energy dependence was used , _",
    "i.e. _ the linear one . due to mathematical constrictions , the model describes a physical system relevant for collective states only in the asymptotic limit of the slope parameter , where its eigensystem is fully scalable .",
    "this provided a new parameter free model called stiffening spherical vibrator ( ssv ) similar to the harmonic spherical vibrator model @xmath1 @xcite but with distorted spectral properties .",
    "ssv enriched thus the set of other parameter - independent collective solutions @xcite stemmed from the seminal works of iachello concerning the critical point solutions @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite . in this paper , one will refer by @xmath1 to the spherical vibrator model , even though the general @xmath1 symmetry contains enough anharmonicities @xcite . the ssv model but with an energy decreasing string",
    "constant leads to an energy spectrum with a threshold corresponding to an infinite quantum number , and therefore does not present any practical importance .",
    "however a similar behaviour of the spectrum was obtained in ref.@xcite in connection with a coulomb - like potential .",
    "it would then be interesting to see the effect of a linearly energy dependent coupling constant on the results corresponding to a @xmath0-unstable coulomb - like potential .    in this paper one",
    "will show that the situation is quite reversed in respect to the formalism of ref.@xcite , meaning that the unperturbed spectrum of the @xmath0-unstable coulomb - like potential is expanded , reaching in the asymptotic limit of the slope parameter the vibrational energy level sequence .",
    "the use of a singular potential instead of a confining one leads however to quite different degeneracies of these energy levels .",
    "this aspect provides the opportunity to theoretically interpret some very low lying @xmath2 states through such complex @xmath3 excitations .",
    "these states are considered as a signature for the shape coexistence phenomenon and their emergence is usually ascribed to the proximity of the corresponding nuclei to major shell and subshell closures where there is a heightened interplay between single - particle and collective degrees of freedom . although the theoretical description of the phenomenon is usually approached with deformed mean - field models or shell - model calculations using different effective interactions extensively reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently with interacting boson model based approaches @xcite , the interpretation of the resulting low lying energy spectrum is often made with the aid of a collective wave - function or by mappings in collective coordinates .",
    "therefore , a fully collective description of these @xmath2 states is more than justified",
    ".    the proposed scope is achieved first by presenting in the next section the analytical construction of the model regarding the hamiltonian , its general solutions , electromagnetic properties and the characteristics of the aforementioned asymptotic limit .",
    "the associated numerical analysis of the model is given in section iii by means of various numerical applications mostly aimed at the comparison of the asymptotic limit with the @xmath1 model and few experimental data of nuclei considered as its candidates .",
    "finally , the conclusions and some perspectives of the proposed theoretical formalism are presented in the last section .",

    "finally , the angular momentum takes all integer values between @xmath19 and @xmath24 excluding the @xmath25 value .    using the change of function @xmath26",

    "therefore , the new @xmath3 density probability for a state @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31=\\left|f_{i}(\\beta)\\right|^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{a}{\\beta}\\right),\\ ] ] and all scalar products involving functions of @xmath3 must be amended with the same factor .",
    "consequently , the slope parameter @xmath32 must be positive given the repulsive nature of the potential ( [ pot ] ) and the condition that the density probability to be positive definite in order to describe a physical system .",
    "moreover , the use of linear dependence on energy has the advantage of producing energy independent integration measure for the scalar products .",
    "this is actually one of the reasons why this particular energy dependence is usually considered in literature @xcite .",
    "the procedure for solving the associated schrdinger equation with the energy dependent potential ( [ pot ] ) , is the same as in the case of the state independent coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "basically , the differential equation ( [ difb ] ) is brought to a whittaker form @xcite : @xmath33f(x)=0,\\ ] ] by the change of variable @xmath34 together with the following notations : @xmath35 the solutions of this differential equation are known as whittaker functions @xmath36 @xcite and can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions of first kind @xmath37 @xcite , such that : @xmath38 although , the condition of negative energy guarantees the regularity of the above solution in the origin , the function in general diverges in the asymptotic limit of @xmath39 .",

    "further on , one will drop the notation @xmath52 , retaining only the solution with the plus sign . note that although the energy spectrum ( [ esol ] ) depends on a single quantum number defined by the sum @xmath53 , the corresponding eigenfunctions have a separate dependence on @xmath54 and @xmath16 , respectively .      employing the general expression for the quadrupole transition operator , @xmath56\\sin{\\gamma}\\nonumber , \\label{te2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a scaling factor , one can calculate the transition rates using the wave function ( [ fb ] ) derived above .",

    ", in the asymptotic limit of @xmath32 the energy attains the expression : @xmath63 which when normalized to the ground state and divided to the excitation energy of the first excited state provides the same energy level sequence as the five - dimensional harmonic oscillator model @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the slope parameter @xmath32 becomes a simple scaling factor and one obtains another parameter - free collective solution which hereafter will be called asymptotic energy dependent coulomb ( aedc ) model .",
    "the essential difference from the @xmath1 spectrum is the quantum number assignment .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 states are indexed by the quantum number @xmath64 , whereas in the present case by @xmath62 .    the parameter - free character of the model in the asymptotic limit is also reflected on the wave functions .",
    "namely , the energy dependence of the wave function vanishes as @xmath65 such that the asymptotic @xmath3 wave function can be expressed as : @xmath66 with @xmath67 the normalisation constant is considered here in respect to the usual @xmath68 integration measure , because the dominant correction term @xmath69 of the density probability is now included in the asymptotic wave function .",

    "finally , plugging expression ( [ eas ] ) into the energy dependent potential , one obtains : @xmath72",
    "in the asymptotic regime of the parameter @xmath32 , the ratio @xmath73 of the excitation energies corresponding to the first two excited states reaches the well known collective minimum value 2 associated to the two - phonon state of the five - dimensional spherical vibrator model . therefore , only this situation has a practical use . nevertheless , in order to understand the analytical properties of the asymptotic regime , an overall inspection of the influence of the slope parameter @xmath32 is necessarily required .",

    "was already mentioned , a close comparison between the two models is compulsory . fig .",
    "[ comp ] , where the low lying energy spectra and the corresponding quadrupole electromagnetic transition probabilities normalized to the same quantities corresponding to the first excited ground band state are depicted for both models , serves perfectly this purpose .",
    "for the calculus of the @xmath55 transition rates defined through eq.([be2 ] ) one gathered the values for the @xmath17 clebsch - gordan coefficients from ref.@xcite , and used the result from the appendix for computing the relevant @xmath3 integrals .",
    "the @xmath1 transition rates are taken from @xcite . due to the common @xmath17 upbringing ,",
    "the distribution of states by seniority is identical in both cases .",
    "the difference appears in the @xmath3 excited states , which are shifted down in the present model in respect to the spherical vibrator spectrum .",
    "this also induces a different degeneracy of the energy levels reflected in a higher density of energy degenerate states . in what concerns the @xmath55 transition rates ,",
    "the @xmath79 ones are higher in the present model retaining however a similar trend of relative distribution of values as in the @xmath1 case . while the interband transitions are completely different in the relating states and therefore can not be compared . indeed , in the present model the @xmath80 transitions which were reported as very small for the unperturbed @xmath0-unstable coulomb - like potential @xcite , vanish altogether .",
    "the only nonvanishing interband transitions are those with @xmath81 , which are quite few in this region and whose values are still small but comparable with the reference value of @xmath82 .",
    "this points to the fact that consecutive @xmath3 excited bands are fully decoupled and the only allowed interband transitions are through two vibrational quanta .    as a consequence ,",
    "the similarity with the energy level sequence of the spherical vibrator model seems to be a fortunate coincidence , because the proposed model has quite distinct analytical properties .",
    "indeed , even though the corresponding @xmath3 wave functions ( [ fbas ] ) and ( [ fu5 ] ) have the same factorized expression , the distinct role played by the seniority and the @xmath3 vibrational quantum numbers induce major differences in the @xmath3 probability density distribution contrary to the energy spectrum which depends only on @xmath62 .",
    "this can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ ro ] , where one plotted the density probability distribution @xmath83 for the ground state , first @xmath0-angular and @xmath3 excited states in both aedc and @xmath1 cases . here",
    "@xmath84 stands for `` @xmath85 '' or `` @xmath86 '' , and @xmath87 is a scaled shape variable which is just @xmath3 for the @xmath1 case , while in the present model s situation is given by @xmath88 .",
    "the peak of the ground state density probability distribution in the @xmath1 case is sharp and symmetrical , while in aedc model , it is asymmetrical and extended over a larger interval of @xmath87 values .",
    "this remains true also for the excited states from the ground band .",
    "additionally , the peak of the density distribution shifts and decreases quicker for the aedc when considering ground band excited states . in what concerns the first @xmath3 excited state",
    ", it is well known that the associated density probability is split into two peaks . while the @xmath1 highest probability @xmath3 value from the ground state has an almost zero probability to occur in the first beta excited state , in the aedc case this possibility is not negligible due to the still maintained asymmetric shape of the peaks .",
    "however the most striking contradistinction between the two models comes from the opposite relative height of the two peaks which are also very separated for the aedc probability .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the main difference between the energy spectra of both models comes from the distribution of the @xmath3 excited states .",
    "taking as a reference the behaviour of the @xmath3 excited density distribution , one can conclude that the phenomenological conditions associated to the present model describe a highly anharmonic oscillation of the nuclear surface .",
    "a similar analysis of the quantum fluctuations in the collective @xmath2 states was performed in @xcite for deformed nuclei . as a matter of fact ,",
    "anharmonicities play an important role in describing the nuclear spectra of near - spherical nuclei @xcite .",

    "the intersection between energy levels and potentials associated to the same state might be considered as points belonging to an effective local potential . inspecting the two panels of fig.[epot ]",
    ", one can see that as @xmath32 increases , the edge of the effective potential becomes sharper and the upper slope relevant for the energy spectrum decreases .",
    "this last aspect means that the system is softening when @xmath32 as well as the energy state increase .",
    "the rate of softening is obviously maximal in case of the aedc .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the behaviour of the @xmath3 density probability from fig.[ro](a ) .",
    "in view of these arguments , aedc seems to be a complementary model to the ssv .",
    "indeed , while the latter corresponds to a fast stiffening nuclear surface , the present model describes an extremely @xmath3 soft nucleus .    before closing this section",
    "it is necessary to comment about the apparent similarity of the energy dependent potential approach introduced in @xcite with the collective geometrical solutions obtained using a deformation dependent mass term @xcite .",
    "the latter can be brought to a deformed schrdinger equation with an effective potential @xcite . in the @xmath0-unstable case of kratzer potential @xcite , which is an extension of the coulomb potential",
    ", this effective potential contains additional dependence on seniority .",
    "the resemblance with the present approach stops at this point .",
    "first of all , one can not construct analytically an effective local potential .",
    "this is because of the iterative nature of the associated differential equation containing explicitly its quantum number .",
    "indeed , while the @xmath0-unstable coulomb - like potential leads to a similar @xmath129 @xcite algebraic group structure as the collective geometric model based on a davidson potential @xcite , its energy dependent version can not be expressed anymore in terms of the same generating operators because the energy dependent term must be replaced with the corresponding operator , tampering thus the involved commutation relations .",
    "by considering a coupling constant for the @xmath0-unstable coulomb - like potential in the bohr hamiltonian which depends linearly on the system s energy , one obtained the corresponding energy spectrum and the wave functions as a function of the slope parameter .",
    "the analytical peculiarity of the induced energy dependence was duly investigated , imposing in the same time an existence interval for the slope parameter where the obtained formalism corresponds to a physically meaning system . as a result ,",
    "the obtained energy spectrum is no longer bounded by the energy threshold corresponding to an infinite quantum number as in the unperturbed problem .",
    "moreover the expansion of the energy spectrum was found to be saturated at normalized energy levels specific to vibrational states described by the @xmath1 dynamical symmetry .",
    "thus , in its asymptotic regime , the slope parameter acquires just a scaling role , providing in this way a new parameter free collective solution succinctly denoted aedc , which along with other such models serves as reference points for general collective phenomena . due to the specific structure of the model , the similarity with @xmath1 stops at the energy level scheme .",
    "indeed , as its analytical properties and the associated numerical applications show , the distribution of states by the seniority and @xmath3 vibration quantum numbers is different , with the special fingerprint of aedc being the degeneracy of the first @xmath2 and @xmath123 states .",
    "incidently this specific spectral signature is associated to shape coexistence phenomenon .",
    "the properties of the low lying states were also studied by means of the @xmath3 probability density distribution , which offered more insight into the distinct behaviour of aedc as a model suitable for shape coexistence . besides the downshift of the @xmath3 excited states in respect to the @xmath1 ones , the @xmath55 transition probabilities within aedc are also different .",
    "the inband rates are overall higher , while the non - vanishing interband transitions are limited to @xmath81 , such that consecutive @xmath3 excited bands are completely decoupled .    experimental realization of the aedc energy spectrum was found in the few nuclei @xmath90se , @xmath91se , @xmath90kr , @xmath92mo and @xmath93mo which are known to exhibit shape coexistence features .",
    "the presence of a low lying @xmath130 state was the major criterium for candidates selection as it is the most pregnant spectral signature of the proposed model .",
    "the best representatives are considered @xmath90se and @xmath92mo nuclei .",
    "the experimental electromagnetic transitions of these isotopes however follow more closely the @xmath1 predictions which hint to a strong spherical component underlying the shape coexistence in these nuclei .",
    "even if the aedc calculations are overestimated in all cases except @xmath90kr , the deviations are smaller for the two mentioned nuclei .    in conclusion",
    ", one must emphasize that this is the first fully collective attempt to describe the low lying energy spectrum of shape coexisting nuclei .",
    "the model obviously is capable to reproduce the experimental energy levels for these nuclei .",
    "however , for a more consistent description including the electromagnetic properties , the single - particle degrees of freedom are indispensable .",
    "there is however a way to extend the applicability of this model , by employing the kratzer or cornell potentials which are more pliable partners of the coulomb potential .",
    "the author acknowledges the financial support received from the romanian ministry of education and research , through the project pn-16 - 42 - 01 - 01/2016 .",
    "various @xmath3 matrix elements needed for calculation of transition probabilities can be expressed analytically by using the following result @xcite : @xmath131 which is valid for @xmath132 .",
    "the factors defining the sum terms denote real extensions of the binomial coefficient .",
