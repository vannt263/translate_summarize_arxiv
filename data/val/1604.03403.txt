    "particles moving in escaping orbits in hamiltonian systems is , without any doubt , one of the most interesting topics in nonlinear dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hamiltonian systems with escapes are also known as open or leaking hamiltonian systems , in which there is a finite energy of escape .",
    "when the value of the energy is higher than the energy of escape , the equipotential surfaces open and escape channels emerge through which the test particle can escape to infinity .",
    "the literature is replete with research studies on the field of leaking hamiltonian systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the problem of escaping orbits in open hamiltonian systems is however less explored than the related problem of chaotic scattering .",
    "the viewpoint of chaos theory has been used in order to investigate and interpret the phenomenon of chaotic scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we would like to emphasize that all the above - mentioned references on the issues of open hamiltonian systems and chaotic scattering are exemplary rather than exhaustive .",
    "in leaking hamiltonian systems an issue of great importance is the determination of the basins of escape .",
    "the basins of escape are similar to the basins of attraction in the case of dissipative systems or to the newton - raphson fractal basins .",
    "many previous papers have been devoted on the study of the basins of escape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite",
    "the reader can find more theoretical details regarding the basins of escape .",
    "moreover , the escape basins in a multi - channel dynamical system of a perturbed harmonic oscillator have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the boundaries between the several basins of escape may be fractal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or in the case where three or more escape channels coexist obey the more restrictive wada property ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the three - body problem is a paradigmatic case in celestial mechanics .",
    "this problem deals with the gravitationally interacting celestial bodies and predicts their newtonian motion .",
    "all planets and asteroids in our solar system move around the sun , while in the same manner the moons orbit their host planets .",
    "the system sun - planet - moon , or the sun - planet - asteroid can be considered as typical examples of the three - body problem . in particular , the three - body problem of the sun - planet - asteroid system can be significantly simplified since the mass of the asteroid is always negligible with respect to the masses of the sun and the planet .",
    "this means that the gravitational influence of the asteroid on the sun and also on the planet can be easily omitted from the equation describing the planetary system . using this assumption",
    "then the three - body problem becomes the usual restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) @xcite . in this case",
    "there are two possibilities regrading the type of motion of the two primary bodies around their common center of mass : the circular rtbp and the elliptic rtbp .",
    "escaping and colliding orbits in the rtbp is another typical example . in @xcite and @xcite a systematic orbit classification was carried out in the planar circular rtbp . in particular , initial conditions of orbits were classified into three main categories : ( i ) bounded ; ( ii ) escaping and ( iii ) collisional , while bounded regular orbit were further classified into orbital families regarding their motion around the two primary bodies .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) investigated the orbital dynamics of the two dimensional version of the earth - moon system in a scattering region around the moon .",
    "they explored the orbital content classifying orbits in the same categories in all possible hill s regions configurations . in the same vein in @xcite and @xcite we classified orbits thus revealing the orbital structure of the saturn - titan and pluto - charon planetary systems , respectively . in the present paper",
    "we shall expand the work initiated in paper i in order to unveil the orbital structure of the three dimensional earth - moon system . from dynamical astronomy point of view the 3d version of",
    "the problem is more important of the 2d due to the reality of transportation of materials throughout the planetary systems .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ mod ] we present in detail the properties of the mathematical model .",
    "all the computational methods we used in order to obtain the classification of the orbits are described in section [ cometh ] . in the following section , we conduct a thorough and systematic numerical investigation revealing the overall orbital structure of the three dimensional earth - moon planetary system by classifying orbits into categories .",
    "our paper ends with section [ disc ] where the discussion and the conclusions of our research are given .",
    "at this point , it would be beneficial to recall the basic properties of the mathematical model which describes the circular restricted three - body problem ( crtbp ) @xcite .",
    "the motion of both primary bodies @xmath3 and @xmath4 is circular around their common center of mass , while the test particle ( which is the third body ) moves under the gravitational filed created by the two primaries . taking into account that the mass of the test particle is significantly smaller than the masses of the primaries we may reasonably assume that the third body does not influence or perturb the motion of the primaries .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath5 , @xmath6 is used to define the non - dimensional masses of the primaries as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for the earth - moon planetary system",
    "we have @xmath8 = 0.0121506683 we adopted the same precision ( number of significant decimal digits ) as in paper i. ] .",
    "the centers of the primaries are both located on the @xmath9-axis at @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for the description of the motion of the test particle we choose a rotating coordinate frame of reference where its origin is at the center of mass of the two primaries .",
    "the total time - independent effective potential function in the rotating frame of reference is @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 are the distances to the respective primaries .",
    "here we would like to point out that we expanded into three dimensions the effective potential function @xmath15 used in paper i , where the third term ( which is not present in the classical crtbp ) is only a constant which controls the critical values of the jacobi constant but it does not affect the motion of the test particle .    the motion of the test particle in this corotating frame of reference is described by the following scaled equations of motion @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18    it is well known that the dynamical system ( [ eqmot ] ) admits only one integral of motion which is known as the jacobi integral of motion .",
    "@xmath19    a five - dimensional ( 5d ) invariant manifold inside the six - dimensional ( 6d ) phase space is defined through the jacobi constant @xmath20 .",
    "this means that for a given value of the total orbital energy the motion of the test particle is restricted in the domain where @xmath21 , while all the other areas are energetically forbidden .",
    "the jacobi constant @xmath20 and the total orbital energy @xmath22 are connected through the relation @xmath23 .",
    "lagrange found that for bodies which move in circular orbits around their common center of gravity there are five distinct three - body formations .",
    "these formations appear to be invariant for an observer in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "moreover , these five locations of the test particle for which its location appears to be stationary or invariant when viewed from the rotating frame are called lagrange libration points @xmath24 , @xmath25 at which @xmath26 @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath27 ( known as collinear points ) are located on the @xmath9-axis , while the other two @xmath28 and @xmath29 are called triangular points and they are located in the vertices of equilateral triangles .",
    "it should be noted that the labeling of the first three lagrange points is not consistent throughout the literature . in our case",
    ", we use the most popular labeling according to which @xmath0 is between the two primaries , @xmath1 is at the right side of @xmath4 , while @xmath27 is at the left side of @xmath3 .",
    "the values of the jacobi integral of motion at the lagrange points @xmath30 are denoted by @xmath31 . for the earth - moon system we have : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 = 3 .",
    "once more , the accuracy of @xmath31 is the same as in paper i.    the three - dimensional ( 3d ) surfaces described by the relation @xmath36 , also known as zero velocity surfaces , determine the geometric extremes possible for a given value of the energy .",
    "these 3d surfaces allow us to determine if it is possible for the test particle to travel from earth to moon or beyond .",
    "the projection of these surfaces onto the configuration ( or position ) space @xmath37 is called the hill s regions .",
    "moreover the boundaries of the hill s regions are called zero velocity curves ( zvcs ) because they are the locus in the configuration @xmath37 space where the kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the structure of the zero velocity surfaces and the corresponding hill s regions strongly depends on the value of the jacobi constant . in particular , there are five distinct energy regions regarding the hill s regions configurations :    * energy region i : @xmath38 : all transport channels are closed , so there are only bounded and collision basins .",
    "* energy region ii : @xmath39 : only the channel around @xmath0 is open thus allowing orbits to enter the earth realm . * energy region iii : @xmath40 : the channel around @xmath1 is open , so orbits can enter the exterior region and escape form the system .",
    "* energy region iv : @xmath41 : both channels around @xmath1 and @xmath27 are open , therefore orbits are free to escape through two different directions .",
    "* energy region v : @xmath42 : the forbidden regions disappear , so motion over the entire configuration space is possible .    in fig .",
    "[ hrcs ] we present the evolution of the structure of the 3d zero velocity surfaces for several values of the jacobi constant .",
    "it is evident that as the value of the jacobi constant decreases several doorways appear through which the test particle can enter the several allowed region of motion .",
    "for the numerical investigation of the orbital structure of the 3d earth - moon system we have to integrate sets of initial conditions of orbits thus classifying them into categories . in systems with three degrees of freedom however , the phase space is six - dimensional and thus the behavior of the orbits can not be easily visualized .",
    "one easy way to overcome this issue is to work in phase spaces with lower dimensions .",
    "let us start with initial conditions on a two - dimensional plane following the approach used successfully in @xcite and @xcite . following this method we are able to classify initial conditions of orbits and visualize our results , if we restrict our exploration to a subspace of the whole 6d phase space .",
    "in fact we choose a value of @xmath43 which defines a two - dimensional @xmath37 slice inside the three - dimensional zero velocity surface . for a specific value of @xmath43 we consider dense , uniform grids of @xmath44 initial conditions @xmath45 regularly distributed on the configuration @xmath37 plane inside the area allowed by the corresponding value of the energy . following a typical approach ,",
    "all orbits are launched with initial conditions inside a certain region , called scattering region , which in our case is @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "for all 3d orbits @xmath48 , while the value of @xmath49 is always obtained from the jacobi integral of motion ( [ ham ] ) as @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in our work",
    "we expand into three dimensions this choice of initial conditions thus considering orbits with @xmath48 and @xmath51 . the case with",
    "non zero values in @xmath9 and @xmath2 components of the velocity of the test particle is another choice which however is not considered here , obviously for saving space . ] .",
    "the value of the jacobi constant defines the structure of the zero velocity surfaces . in particular ,",
    "the region around the moon can be connected or not to the earth realm through the neck around @xmath0 or to the exterior region through the opening around @xmath1 . therefore the initial conditions of orbits inside the scattering region can be classified into categories : ( i ) bounded orbits which remain in the moon realm , ( ii ) escaping orbits to the earth realm through @xmath0 , ( iii ) escaping orbits to the exterior realm through @xmath1 , and ( iv ) orbits that collide with the moon .",
    "appropriate numerical criteria are needed in order to distinguish between the four types of motion . following the approach used in paper i",
    ", we assume that the moon is a finite body with a mean radius of approximately 1738 km ( about @xmath52 dimensionless length units ) . therefore",
    ", if an orbit reaches the surface of the moon its numerical integration ends thus producing an orbit leaking in the phase space . for escaping orbits we shall extend in three dimensions",
    "the escape criteria used in paper i. in particular , an escaping orbit to the earth realm must satisfy the conditions @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and the third body inside the sphere around the the moon of radius @xmath55 . in the same vein , an escaping orbit to the exterior realm",
    "must fulfill the conditions @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , or @xmath58 , or , if @xmath53 , @xmath59 ( i.e. , the third body is outside the sphere just defined ) .",
    "it should be clarified that the tolerances @xmath60 and @xmath61 were included in the escape criteria so as to avoid the unstable lyapunov orbits @xcite to be incorrectly classified as escaping orbits .    in the crtbp",
    "the phase space is divided into the collision , escaping and non - escaping regimes . in most cases ,",
    "the non - escaping regions correspond to ordered orbits forming stability islands . in many hamiltonian systems however , trapped chaos have also been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we decided to distinguish between trapped chaotic motion and non - escaping ordered motion .",
    "a plethora of chaos indicators is available for distinguishing between chaotic and ordered motion . in this study",
    "we choose the smaller alingment index ( sali ) which has been proved , over the years , a very reliable , fast and effective tool ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "the maximum time @xmath62 of the numerical integration was set to be equal to @xmath63 dtu ( dimensionless time units ) , corresponding to about 128.63 yr .",
    "needless to say that when an orbit collided with the moon or escaped the numerical integration was effectively ended .",
    "our choice of such a long integration time can be justified by the presence of  sticky orbits \" which behave for long time intervals as regular ones before they exhibit their true chaotic nature .",
    "so we wanted to be sure that all initial conditions of orbits have enough integration time for revealing their character .",
    "a double precision bulirsch - stoer ` fortran 77 ` algorithm ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used in order to forward integrate the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) as well as the variational equations for all the initial conditions of the orbits .",
    "the error regarding the energy conservation throughout our computations was smaller than @xmath64 , which is sufficiently low . for initial conditions leading to collision with the moon ,",
    "where the test particle moves inside a region of radius @xmath65 around the same primary , we applied the lemaitre s global regularization method ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all graphics presented in this work have been created using version 10.3 of the software mathematica@xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted on the classification of orbits in the configuration @xmath37 space into five categories : ( i ) bounded regular orbits ; ( ii ) trapped chaotic orbits ; ( iii ) escaping orbits to the earth realm ; ( iv ) escaping orbits to the exterior realm and ( v ) collisional orbits .",
    "furthermore , two additional dynamical quantities of the orbits will be examined : ( i ) the time - scale of the collision and ( ii ) the time - scale of the escape .",
    "our main numerical task will be to explore these properties for various values of @xmath43 and of the total orbital energy , or in other words for various values of the jacobi constant .",
    "in particular , we will consider four different energy cases which correspond to the first four possible hill s regions configurations . in the last hill",
    "s regions configuration the escape channels lose their meaning due to the lack of forbidden regions , so we can not distinguish between escape to the earth realm and to the exterior realm .    in the following color - coded orbit type diagrams ( otds )",
    "each pixel is assigned a color according to the type of the orbit .",
    "therefore , all initial conditions of orbits can be classified into bounded orbits , unbounded or escaping orbits and collisional orbits . in this special type of poincar surface of section ( pss )",
    "the phase space emerges as a close and compact mix of escape basins , collision basins and stability regions .",
    "our initial numerical computations suggest that a non - zero amount of non - escaping orbits is present along with escaping and collisional orbits . generally speaking ,",
    "most of the non - escaping basins are composed of initial conditions of ordered orbits , where an adelphic integral of motion is present .",
    "this additional integral of motion restricts their accessible phase space and therefore it hinders their escape from the system .",
    "the color - coded otds for four values of @xmath43 when @xmath67 are presented in fig .",
    "[ hr1](a - d ) .",
    "the outermost black solid line is the zvc on the configuration @xmath37 space which is defined as @xmath68 . inspecting these diagrams",
    "we observe that in energy region i there is only bounded and collisional motion .",
    "in particular , for @xmath69 , we see in fig . [ hr1]a that two stability islands are present inside the unified collision basin .",
    "in contrast to paper i we decided to exclude initial conditions of orbits inside the radius of the moon because these orbits lack of physical meaning .",
    "therefore , the white hole around the center of the moon shown in fig .",
    "[ hr1]a represents an additional  forbidden \" region .",
    "the stability island situated on the right side of the moon , surrounds a retrograde ( clockwise ) symmetric periodic orbit around @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the stability island , located on the left side of the moon , surrounds a periodic orbit around @xmath4 which is symmetric to a reflection over the @xmath9-axis @xmath70 and is traveled in counterclockwise sense , hence , prograde with respect to the rotating coordinate system . in the case of the planar hill problem",
    "it was proved that the stability island located on the left side of the moon is much more stable than that on the right side in relation to energy variation @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that at the boundaries of the stability island on the right side of the moon we identified several individual initial conditions corresponding to trapped chaotic orbits ( shown as black dots ) . as the value of @xmath43 increases the area of the zvc",
    "is reduced thus leading to motion close to the moon and therefore the area of the central white forbidden region increases .",
    "moreover it is evident in figs .",
    "[ hr1](b - d ) that the size of both stability islands reduces with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "additional numerical experiments ( not shown here ) using other values of @xmath20 , always for @xmath38 , suggest that in energy region i collision motion dominates for orbits with relative high values of @xmath43 .    in the following fig .",
    "[ hr1t](a - d ) we show how the collision times of orbits are distributed on the configuration @xmath37 space for the four values of @xmath43 discussed in fig .",
    "[ hr1](a - d ) .",
    "light reddish colors correspond to fast collisional orbits , dark blue / purple colors indicate large collision times , while white color denote stability islands of regular motion and trapped chaotic motion .",
    "note that the scale on the color bar is logarithmic .",
    "looking carefully at fig .",
    "[ hr1t](a - d ) we clearly observe that in the area between the two stability islands the collision times of orbits are higher than those of the initial conditions located in the left side of the plane .      when @xmath72 the neck around @xmath0 opens thus allowing orbits to enter the earth realm . indeed for @xmath73 and @xmath69",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ hr2]a that there is an escape channel in the left side of the zvc . near the lagrange point",
    "@xmath0 we observe an escape basin , while at the boundaries of the right stability region we see a highly - fractal structure by constructed by initial conditions of escaping orbits .",
    "for @xmath74 the width of the escape channel reduces as it is seen in fig .",
    "now the fractal structure at the right stability island has been significantly reduced , while the size of the stability island has grown . as the value of @xmath43 increases the width of the escape channel decreases as we proceed to higher @xmath43 slices of the three - dimensional energy surface . in fig .",
    "[ hr2]c where @xmath75 one can see that the zvc is closed .",
    "this however does not mean that the transport channel to the earth realm is closed .",
    "it simply means that the @xmath75 slice is above the escape channel . here",
    "the orbital structure of the configuration space is very similar to that discussed earlier in energy region i. indeed , there is no evidence of escape motion to earth realm whatsoever . on the contrary",
    "the entire @xmath37 plane is covered by either collisional orbits or non - escaping regular orbits .",
    "the same pattern continues in fig .",
    "[ hr2]d where @xmath76 .",
    "it is seen that the extent of both stability islands has been reduced , while all fractal areas have disappeared since the basin boundaries are very smooth .",
    "we numerically integrated additional sets of orbits for other values of the jacobi constant in the same energy region @xmath77 and for several values of @xmath43 . in all",
    "examined cases we observed that for @xmath43 slices above the escape channel the test particle does not enter the earth realm , even though the corresponding escape channel is wide open . in fig .",
    "[ orb](a - d ) we provide a characteristic example of a 3d orbit with initial conditions : @xmath78 , while @xmath49 is obtained from the jacobi integral of motion for @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ orb]a we see the orbit inside the three - dimensional energy shell , while in panels ( c ) and ( d ) we present the two - dimensional projections of the orbit on the @xmath37 and @xmath79 planes , respectively .",
    "the time - evolution of sali in panel ( b ) clearly indicates that the orbit is chaotic .",
    "in fact this orbit moves chaotically around the moon for about 312 time units and then it collides with the moon .",
    "the interesting phenomenon is that the test particle does not enter the earth realm even though the transport channel is open .",
    "our numerical analysis suggests that 3d orbits with @xmath43 higher than the height of the escape channel remain trapped in the moon realm and eventually collide with it .    at this point",
    "we would like to emphasize that the numerical integration is stopped as soon as the test particle passes @xmath0 thus entering the earth realm .",
    "however , if we do not stop the numerical integration some orbits that initially entered the earth realm may return to the moon s region , or collide into one of the primary bodies , or even enter the exterior region and then escape to infinity . in our calculations",
    "however , we follow the approach used in paper i and we consider an orbit to escape to earth realm if the test particle passes @xmath0 even if its true asymptotic behaviour at very long time limit is different .    the distribution of the escape and collision times of orbits on the configuration @xmath37 space is shown in fig .",
    "[ hr2t](a - d ) .",
    "one may observe that the results are very similar to those presented earlier in fig .",
    "[ hr1t](a - d ) , where we found that orbits with initial conditions inside the escape and collision basins have the smallest escape / collision rates , while on the other hand , the longest escape / collision rates correspond to orbits with initial conditions in the fractal regions of the otds ( see e.g. , panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ hr2 t ] ) . inspecting the spatial distribution of various different ranges of escape time , we are able to associate medium escape time with the stable manifold of a non - attracting chaotic invariant set , which is spread out throughout this region of the chaotic sea , while the largest escape time values on the other hand , are linked with sticky motion around the stability islands .",
    "this energy region constitutes the hill s regions with the most interest in point of view of planetary systems .",
    "furthermore , it has many practical applications , such as orbit determination of spacecraft mainly based on many - models and also the phenomenon of temporary capture of comets or asteroids around planets in our solar system . in this energy region",
    "the exterior realm basins arise competing for the chaotic sea with the earth realm basins and the collision set .",
    "the exterior realm rises when @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "[ hr3](a - d ) we see that for @xmath81 both necks around @xmath0 and @xmath1 are open . in fig .",
    "[ hr3]a where @xmath82 we observe that the configuration @xmath37 space is covered by all types of basins . at the left side of the moon collision basins and earth realm basins",
    "dominate , while at the right side of the moon the majority of the @xmath37 plane is covered by initial conditions of orbits which escape entering the exterior region .",
    "furthermore it is seen that the stability islands at the right side of the moon is no longer present in this energy range . as the value of @xmath43 increases three important phenomena take place in the configuration space : ( i ) the area of the stability island located at the left side of the moon decreases , ( ii ) the exterior realm basin , both with smooth and non - smooth boundaries increases , as well as , the region of fractal boundaries between the three types of basins grows , ( iii ) at the highest value of @xmath43 studied , that is @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "[ hr3]d ) , both collision basins merge together .",
    "it should be pointed out that in this energy region we did not encountered the phenomenon of trapped chaos observed in the previous energy range . after integrating many sets of initial conditions for various values of the jacobi constant and for several values of @xmath43",
    "we conclude that in this energy range escape orbits to both earth realm and exterior realm are always present regardless of how high is the value of @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "[ hr3t](a - d ) we illustrate the corresponding distribution of the escape and collision time of orbits on the configuration @xmath37 space .      when @xmath84 the neck around @xmath27 opens thus allowing orbits to escape to the exterior region also from the left side of the earth .",
    "since we decided to focus our study in the vicinity of the moon the new escape channel in the zvc is not visible this time . in fig .",
    "[ hr4](a - d ) we observe for four values of @xmath43 the orbital structure of the configuration space when @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "[ hr4]a where @xmath74 we see that the majority of the configuration @xmath37 plane is covered by initial conditions that lead to escape to the exterior region .",
    "the second most populated type of initial conditions corresponds to the earth realm basins .",
    "the stability island at the left side of the moon and also the collision basins are still present .",
    "when @xmath86 one may observe that the stability island has disappeared , while the collision basins are very limited and located mainly in the boundaries between the escape basins .",
    "for all larger and permissible values of @xmath43 the escape basins dominate the configuration space .",
    "in fact we may say that the divide the @xmath37 plane into two areas around the moon .",
    "in particular the majority of the left side of the moon is occupied by initial conditions which lead to escape to earth realm , while almost all the right side of the moon is covered by initial conditions of orbits which escape to the exterior region .",
    "for @xmath87 it is seen in fig .",
    "[ hr4]d that a small collision basin emerges inside the earth realm basin .",
    "the distribution of the escape and collision times of orbits on the configuration space is depicted in fig .",
    "[ hr4t](a - d ) .",
    "we see similar outcomes with that presented in the three previous subsections .",
    "both fractal and non - fractal ( smooth ) basin boundaries have been identified in the color - coded otds shown in figs .",
    "[ hr1 ] , [ hr2 ] , [ hr3 ] and [ hr4 ] .",
    "the existence of fractal basin boundaries is a very common phenomenon observed in leaking hamiltonian systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the crtbp system",
    "the leakages can be defined by both collisional and escaping initial conditions of orbits .",
    "the high complexity of the basin boundaries implies that in these regions is very difficult , or even impossible , to predict the type of motion of the test particle ( e.g. , a satellite , asteroid , planet etc ) . in fig .",
    "[ orbs](a - c ) we present an illuminating example showing the highly unpredictability in the fractal regions of the plots .",
    "the initial conditions of the three orbits were taken form the otd of fig .",
    "[ hr3]c where @xmath81 .",
    "all three orbits have : @xmath88 , @xmath86 , @xmath48 , @xmath51 ( obtained from the jacobi integral of motion ) , while only @xmath89 is different . in particular when @xmath90 we see in fig .",
    "[ orbs]a that the corresponding orbit collides with the surface of the moon after about 6.8 dtu . on the other hand , when @xmath91 ( panel b ) and @xmath92 ( panel c ) the test particle escapes to the earth and to the exterior realm after about 14.5 dtu and 6.7 dtu , respectively .",
    "thus it becomes evident that inside the fractal regions a slight change to the initial conditions of an orbit leads to completely different type of motion .",

    "the color code is the same as in fig .",
    "it is seen that in this case the grid of initial conditions is in fact a three dimensional solid and therefore only its outer surface is visible .",
    "a tomographic - style approach can be used in order to penetrate and examine the interior region of the solid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we would like to point out that to our knowledge this is the first time that a three dimensional distribution of initial conditions is used for classifying orbits in the crtbp .    using the above - mentioned technique regarding the three dimensional distribution of initial conditions of orbits we can monitor how the percentages of the different types of orbits in the 3d configuration space evolve as a function of the jacobi constant @xmath20 . for obtaining a more complete view we integrated more 3d grids ( not shown here ) for additional energy levels .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",

    "the evolution of the percentage of bounded regular orbits is very similar",

    "the computations suggest that for @xmath135 the exterior realm basins occupy more than 80% of the configuration space .",
    "we used the three dimensional version of the circular restricted three - body problem ( crtbp ) in order to numerically investigate the orbital dynamics of a small body ( spacecraft , comet or asteroid ) under the influence of the potential of the earth - moon system .",
    "in particular , we expanded into three dimensions the numerical analysis of paper i regarding the planar earth - moon system .",
    "all the initial conditions of orbits were initiated in the vicinity of the moon which was our scattering region .",

    "the orbital structure of the basins was monitored by varying both the value of the jacobi constant and the initial value of the @xmath2 coordinate . as far as we know , this is the first time that the three dimensional orbital content in the vicinity of the moon , or in any other planetary system , is explored through orbit classification in such a detailed and systematic way and this is exactly the novelty and the contribution of the current work .    in our exploration",
    "we adopted the same numerical methods used in paper i. for the numerical integration of the sets of initial conditions of orbits in each type of plane , we needed between about 0.5 hours and 16 hours of cpu time on a quad - core i7 2.4 ghz pc , depending of course on the escape and collision rates of orbits in each case . for each initial condition the maximum time of the numerical integration",
    "was set to be equal to @xmath63 time units however , when a test particle escaped or collided with the moon the numerical integration was effectively ended and proceeded to the next available initial condition .",
    "we provide quantitative information regarding the escape and collision dynamics in the crtbp .",
    "the main outcomes of our numerical research can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in the first hill",
    "s regions configurations @xmath136 only bounded and collisional types of motion are possible .",
    "it was found that as we proceed to higher values of @xmath43 the size of the stability islands is reduced and collision basins dominate the configuration space .",
    "2 .   escaping orbits to the earth realm are added in the second hill s regions configurations @xmath77 . in this energy range we observed a very interesting phenomenon related with the presence of escaping orbits .",
    "in particular , escaping orbits are present only for values of @xmath43 up to the height of the transport channel . for higher values of @xmath43 escaping orbits",
    "completely disappear , even though the transport channel in the three dimensional zero velocity surface is still open .",
    "in the third hill s regions configurations @xmath137 all possible types of orbits are present .",
    "our numerical analysis suggests that the size of the bounded basins corresponding to regular orbits is reduced with increasing @xmath43 . at the same time",
    "the configuration space is covered by a mixture of several types of basins with both smooth and fractal basin boundaries .",
    "4 .   basins of bounded ordered orbits are not always present . indeed in the fourth hill s regions configurations the stability island on the left side of the moon disappears for high values of @xmath43 . moreover ,",
    "the escape basins share the configuration space , while the collision basins are heavily confined . we also observed that the fractality is considerably reduced with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "our investigation of the @xmath97 planes revealed that for low energy levels bounded motion dominated for @xmath138 , collisional motion for intermediate values of @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) , while for high values of @xmath43 orbits which escape to the exterior region is the most populated family . on the other hand , for high energy levels ( low values of the jacobi constant )",
    "the exterior realm basin is prevailing regardless the initial value of the @xmath2 coordinate",
    "the analysis of the @xmath79 planes suggests that collisional motion dominates in the first and second hill s regions configurations , for high values of @xmath43 , while on the other hand escaping orbits to the exterior realm is the most populated orbital family in the third and fourth hill s regions configurations for relative high initial values of the @xmath2 coordinate . in particular , when the escaping orbits to the exterior region dominate all other types of orbits completely disappear .",
    "we proved that that the escape and collision times of orbits are directly linked to the basins of escape and collision . in particular , inside the basins of escape / collision as well as relatively away from the fractal domains , the shortest escape / collision rates of the orbits had been measured . on the other hand , the longest escape / collision periods correspond to initial conditions of orbits either near the fractal boundaries between the escape / collision basins or in the vicinity of the stability islands .",
    "judging by the detailed and novel outcomes of our systematic numerical investigation we may say that our task has been successfully completed .",
    "we hope that the present numerical analysis and the corresponding results to be useful in the field of escape dynamics in the crtbp .",
    "it is in our future plans to use the outcomes of this work in order to investigate the sun - jupiter system and determine the final states of the jupiter s moons , co - orbital objects and asteroids .",
