    "curvaton has been widely discussed in the literature as an alternative of inflaton to generate primordial perturbations in the early universe @xcite . during inflation period , with the addition of the so - called  curvaton field \" which can generate the most of the primordial perturbations needed in the early times , constraints on the background evolution of the universe",
    "can be widely released , and it is easier to have viable models which can fit the data . at the end of inflation , the ( isocurvature ) perturbations generated by curvaton can be transferred into adiabatic ones @xcite , which is required by the observations . for extended study of curvaton models , see @xcite .",
    "recently , we studied a new curvaton model with its kinetic term coupled nonminimally to the einstein tensor , @xmath2 . this kind of coupling can be viewed as a subgroup of horndeski theory @xcite , or the most general scalar - tensor theory @xcite , which is regarded as a ghost - free theory even when null energy condition is violated . moreover , due to such kind of coupling , we show that the scale - dependence of the scalar perturbations can be independent of the background evolution , and is scale - invariant , provided only that the background equation - of - state is nearly a constant .",
    "that means , the scale - invariant power spectrum can be obtained in this model , even if the background is not inflation at all .",
    "we also take into account the tensor perturbation .",
    "although it can bring some constraints on the value of eos , still a large range of value is allowed .",
    "furthermore , we also discussed the transfer from curvaton perturbations into curvature perturbations , as well as local non - gaussianity generated in this model .    in early 2013 ,",
    "the planck satellite released its first observational result about cosmology , and one highlight point is the accurate but small non - gaussianity of the early universe @xcite .",
    "the planck data shows that the estimator of the equilateral non - gaussianity is within @xmath3 ( 1@xmath4 ) , while that of squeezed ones is within @xmath5 ( 1@xmath4 ) .",
    "it is quite an attracting result , which could rule out many early universe models .",
    "although we have shown that the local non - gaussianity generated in our model is consistent with the data , full non - gaussianity analysis including the equilateral ones are still not taken . as a completion of the study of this model , in this paper we will study the other shapes of its non - gaussianities to see if this model can pass the newest observational data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the background evolution of our model , and in sec .",
    "iii we analyze its perturbations .",
    "after given the basic perturbation equations , in the second and third subsections we show the results of perturbation at the second order . from subsection",
    "* d * to subsection * g * , we calculated the third order perturbations of pure tensor part , pure scalar part , one tensor plus two scalar part and one scalar plus two tenors part , respectively . in each part , we plot the shape function of the correlation functions , and especially for pure scalar part , we give the formulation of the non - gaussianity estimator @xmath6 in its equilateral limit in order to compare with the observational constraints by planck data .",
    "the last section is our conclusion .",
    "the action of nonminimal derivative coupling curvaton is considered as @xcite [ action ] = ^4x  , where @xmath2 is the einstein tensor : @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is an arbitrary coefficient .",
    "the nonminimal derivative coupling field was first proposed in @xcite and has been analyzed in various aspects of cosmology and gravity theories @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "deffayet et , al . showed that field with nonminimal derivative coupling can be included into the generalized galileon theory which is inspired from the horndeski theory @xcite , and it can have the appealing property that there will be no ghost modes . another curvaton model made of galileon is given in @xcite , where the full scalar perturbations has been calculated .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the equation of motion for the curvaton field @xmath9 , such as [ eom ] h^2+(2 + 3h^2)h+v_=0  , and its energy density and pressure can be expressed as [ rho ] _ & = & h^2 ^ 2+v ( )  , + [ p ] p_&=&-(3h^2 ^ 2 + 2h^2 + 4h)-v ( )  , respectively .",
    "the background evolution of the curvaton field with various types of potential has been classified and briefly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can define the following parameters : [ para ] y^2  ,  ,  -  ,  _  , for later convenience . for inflationary background ,",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are much smaller than unity .",
    "notice also that @xmath13 .",
    "in this subsection , we give the basic formulations of perturbation of our model up to 3rd order which will be used in the following subsections .",
    "first of all , the perturbed metric can be written as : [ adm ] ds^2=-n^2dt^2+h_ij(dx^i+n^idt)(dx^j+n^jdt )  , where @xmath14 is the lapse function , @xmath15 is the shift vector , and @xmath16 is the induced 3-metric .",
    "one can then perturb these functions as : [ metricpert ] n=1 +  ,  n_i=_i  ,  h_ij = a^2(t)e^2e^_ij  , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the scalar metric perturbations , and @xmath20 denotes the tensor part of perturbation .",
    "the pertubation of @xmath9 field is [ fieldpert ] ( t)+(t,*x )  . in the following",
    ", we will take the spatial - flat gauge @xmath21 for convenience , and neglect the perturbation of the background field @xmath22 . *    using these perturbation elements",
    ", we could then expand the curvaton action ( [ action ] ) order by order : [ perturbaction ] = _ 0+_ss+_tt+_sss+_ttt+_stt+_sst+ ...  , where the subscript  0 \" denotes background , @xmath23 and @xmath24 means scalar and tensor parts for 2nd order perturbation , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the pure scalar part , pure tensor part , two scalar coupled with one tensor part , and one scalar coupled with two scalar part of 3rd order perturbations , respectively . as is well known that at the 2nd order , the scalar and tensor modes decouples with each other , while from the 3rd order , they are coupled together and we should also take into account their cross correlation function .",
    "perturbations equal to ( or higher than ) 4th order are regarded as negligible corrections and will not be considered in this context .",
    "the n - point correlation functions of any perturbative quantity ( in its momentum space ) @xmath29 is defined as : ( * k*_1,t)(*k*_2,t) ... (*k*_n , t)where @xmath29 can either be the scalar purturbation @xmath30 or tensor perturbation @xmath31 . specifically , the two - point correlation functions is ( * k*_1,t)(*k*_2,t)=|(k_1,t)|^2 ^ 3(*k*_1+*k*_2 )   where @xmath32 , and the three - point correlation functions is [ ng ] & & ( * k*_1,t)(*k*_2,t)(*k*_3,t ) + & = & -i|_t_i^t_fdt^|  , where @xmath33 is the hamiltonian extracted from the 3rd order perturbed action of ( [ perturbaction ] ) .",
    "we observe these correlation functions by their spectra .",
    "the spectrum for two point correlation function ( power spectrum ) is defined as : _ ( k)|(k , t = t_)|^2=a_s()^n_s-1  , for power spectrum , it is important to know its amplitude @xmath34 , as well as its spectral index @xmath35 which describes dependence with the wavenumber of the perturbation modes , @xmath36 , since they can directly be connected with observational data .",
    "recent planck 2013 data gives the constraint of @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "while the spectrum for three correlation function ( bispectrum ) is defined as : [ correlation ] b(*k*_1,*k*_2,*k*_3)=|_t = t _  .    for bispectrum , we take care of the shape of the correlation function as functions of wavenumbers of each point , @xmath40 , which is defined via bispectrum as : [ shape ] b(*k*_1,*k*_2,*k*_3)=(*k*_1,*k*_2,*k*_3 )  .",
    "moreover , one can also define the estimator , [ fnl ] f_nl=  . which can be constrained directly by the observational data .",
    "the planck data have imposed stringent constraints on both equilateral and squeezed limits of @xmath6 , namely @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( 1@xmath4 ) .",
    "these results can be well used to constraint models that give rise to primordial non - gaussianities .",
    "the spectrum for four point correlation function is called trispectrum , and so on and so forth .",
    "the trispectrum is described by its shape as well as the estimator @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "up till now , the constraints on trispectum is still very poor , only having an upper bound of @xmath45 ( 2@xmath4 ) .      in this subsection ,",
    "we focus on the scalar perturbation up to 2nd order in this model , which is basically obtained from @xmath46 in ( [ perturbaction ] ) .",
    "first of all , we notice that @xmath14 and @xmath47 in ( [ adm ] ) are only constraint quantities and have no dynamics , we can make use of techniques in @xcite to express them using field variables : = a_1+a_2  ,  ^2=b_1+b_2+b_3 ^ 2  , where we define a_1&&-  ,  a_2  , + b_1&&a^2  , + b_2&&a^2  , + b_3&&-  .",
    "then the next step is to expand the action to second order of @xmath48 .",
    "as has been demonstrated in @xcite , we choose the kinetic term of the field @xmath9 to be @xmath49 such that the 2nd order perturbation action will be like [ perturb ] _ ss = d^3xd  , where q_sp_,x~  ,  c_s^2  , and @xmath50 means derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath51 .",
    "however , since we worry that the nonminimal coupling will bring nontrivial effects to the perturbation action , we fully expand the action without neglecting the metric perturbation .",
    "we then obtain a more complete form of perturbed action : [ perturb2 ] _ ss = dd^3xa^2  , where [ smally ] q_s-(2 - 7 )  ,  c_s^2-(2 - 7 )  ,  m_eff^2v _  . in the @xmath52 limit while their full expression is given in eqs .",
    "( 20 ) of @xcite .",
    "in order to make this model free of ghost and gradient instabilities , we require @xmath53 , @xmath54 , which leads to [ constraint1 ] > 0  ,  w=-1 + 1 )  , + & or &  ( -<w<1 )   for contracting phase and n_t=  ( w<- )   for expanding phase . one can expect future planck or bicep data to put further constraints on the @xmath55 .      in the following",
    ", we will discuss about 3-point correlation functions of our model , namely non - gaussianities .",
    "since for more than second order , the tensor perturbations couples to the scalar ones , the correlation functions contain not only pure scalar and tensor parts , but also have mixed parts between scalar and tensor modes .",
    "as a full investigation , we will analyze all these cases in the following subsection .",
