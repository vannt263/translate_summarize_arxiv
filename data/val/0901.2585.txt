    "quantum phase measurements can not be described by means of a proper observable and different operational approaches have been introduced over the years @xcite . on the other hand , from a practical point of view , phase detection of quantum fields is generally associated with interferometric devices , _",
    "i.e. _ , detection schemes aimed at the estimation of phase by measuring field- or intensity - based quantities with phase - dependent statistics @xcite . the art of interferomety , in turn , consists in answering to two question : a ) how can the unknown phase be effectively retrieved from the data sample ? and",
    "b ) which is the resulting precision ?",
    "the first point amounts to the choice of an estimator , _",
    "i.e. _ , a function from the data sample to the set of possible values of the phase - shift . among possible estimators",
    "bayes @xcite and maximum likelihood ones @xcite play a special role due to their asympotic ( _ i.e. _ , for large number of measurements ) properties .",
    "the second point may be properly addressed in the framework of quantum estimation theory , which addresses the inference of a physical quantity which is not directly accessible by means of the measurement of a different observable , or a set of observables , somehow related to the quantity of interest .",
    "quantum estimation is a powerful tool to infer a single parameter , as well to a set of parameters , up to the full reconstruction of the density matrix of an unknown quantum state , with or without the use of prior information @xcite .",
    "precision of any unbiased estimator is bounded by the inverse fisher information of the probability distribution of the measurements outcomes , whereas the ultimate limit is written in term of the inverse quantum fisher information ( qfi ) .    in quantum optical systems , homodyne measurements of field quadratures and",
    "gaussian signals play a leading role .",
    "indeed , measurement of quadratures has been shown to achieve phase estimation for coherent states with precision bounded by the ( classical ) fisher information @xcite .",
    "this result have been further improved by looking for the optimal state achieving the ultimate bound related to the qfi @xcite . among the pure gaussian states ,",
    "squeezed vacuum has been found to be the most sensitive state at fixed energy and homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the same signal allows optimal estimation of loss in bosonic channels @xcite and of interaction parameters of single- and two - mode bilinear bosonic hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , in this paper we address optimal phase estimation by using gaussian states , homodyne measurements and bayesian estimation .",
    "we analyze the behavior for increasing number of measurements and show that optimality may be approached also with a limited number of runs upon using two - step methods acting on the squeezed vacuum probe and/or on the homodyne reference .",
    "moreover , we prove that , in principle , the performances of double homodyne detection can not beat the homodyne measurement ones , thus validating the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "s : estimation ] we briefly review local quantum estimation theory and the ultimate bounds to precision in the phase - shift estimation by gaussian states . in section [ s : hdbi ]",
    "homodyne and double homodyne statistics are explicitly calculated for the phase shifted squeezed vacuum as input : this leads us to conclude that performances of the double homodyne detection can not reach the limit imposed by qfi , while single homodyne does .",
    "then , after describing our inference scheme , based on homodyne detection and bayesian inference , the asymptotic limit for large number of collected data is studied in details , as well as the validity of the gaussian approximation . since the performances of this kind of inference protocol depend on the actual value of the ( unknown ) phase shift , we suggest two feasible two - step adaptive methods @xcite , the first acting on the squeezing parameter , the other on the squeezing and local oscillator phases , that allow always to reach the optimal estimation .",

    "<S> we address phase - shift estimation by means of squeezed vacuum probe and homodyne detection . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze bayesian estimator , which is known to asymptotically saturate the classical cramr - rao bound to the variance , and discuss convergence looking at the a posteriori distribution as the number of measurements increases . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest two feasible adaptive methods , acting on the squeezing parameter and/or the homodyne local oscillator phase , which allow to optimize homodyne detection and approach the ultimate bound to precision imposed by the quantum cramr - rao theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the performances of our two - step methods are investigated by means of monte carlo simulated experiments with a small number of homodyne data , thus giving a quantitative meaning to the notion of asymptotic optimality . </S>"
