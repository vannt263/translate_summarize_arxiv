    "the discovery of the h mode with enhanced confinement in asdex [ 1 ] had openned a new age of tokamak fusion research .",
    "extensive experimental works were performed to identify the key procedures and signatures that carried the l to the h confinement mode [ 2,3 ] .",
    "these procedures included pellet injection for density enhancement , neutral beam or radio frequency heating for temperature and electric conductivity profiling , etc [ 4,5 ] .",
    "the experimental signatures of l / h transition were a drastic reduction of the @xmath0 hydrogen emission and a sudden decrease of the plasma floating potential .",
    "these were accompanied by a good enhancement of plasma density and energy confinements , plus a steepening of the edge plasma profile and a reduction of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) activities [ 6,7 ] .",
    "observationally , the l / h transition was accompanied by an increase in the toroidal and poloidal rotations [ 3 ] . nevertheless , it was not clear that this velocity increase was the cause or was the consequence of the transition .",
    "the l / h transition is believed to be caused by divertor shaping of the edge plasma , under high levels of heating power .",
    "action of the divertor plus the edge gradient pump up the static radial electric field that drives a zonal flow near the edge rational magnetic surface [ 8,9 ] .",
    "this zonal flow is thought bo cause a transport barrier that enhances density and energy confinements .",
    "the plasma is thought to self - organize gradually under this scenario to reach the h mode [ 10 ] . here , we take a different approach to view the l / h transition .",
    "we consider the toroidal and poloidal rotations on the equilibrium scaling , not transport scaling , as equilibrium parameters .",
    "we solve for rotational equilibria , under specific source functions , in spherical coordinates by seeking toroidal solutions [ 11 ] .",
    "there are two independent solutions for rotational equilibrium , and we associate them to the l and h modes . under this equilibrium configuration approach , the transition is seen as a bifurcation from one equilibrium to another , under external drivings such as pellet injection for plasma density and strong heating for temperature profiling .",
    "because of the steep edge gradient of the h mode , the large static radial electric field , the zonal flow , and the associated confinements , come as the natural consequences , not causes , of the h mode solution .",
