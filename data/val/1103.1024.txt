    "in the standard model ( sm ) , elementary particles are grouped into multiplets of various symmetry groups such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , etc . particles and antiparticles belong then to complex conjugate representations ( e.g. when coloured quarks are assigned to representation @xmath2 of @xmath3 , the antiquarks are assigned to @xmath4 ) . with the standard particle theory formulated on the background of classical space and time , the concepts of complex conjugation and time reversal are closely related .",
    "accordingly , stckelberg and feynman interpret the antiparticles as particles ` moving backwards in time ' .",
    "the spacetime - based description of reality provided by the standard model is very successful . yet",
    ", there are many questions that go beyond what sm was devised to answer .",
    "these include : why the physical quantities that enter into the sm as parameters have their specific values ( masses of elementary particles or mixing angles between particle generations ) , what is the origin of various internal quantum numbers , or how to describe both elementary particles and gravity in a single framework .",
    "the latter issue suggests that the standard particle theory should give way to an approach in which spacetime serves no longer as a background but becomes a dynamical structure , in line with general relativity ideas .",
    "in fact , many physicists have argued that we need an approach in which macroscopic classical time and space emerge - in the limit of a large interconnected structure - out of a simple timeless and alocal quantum level @xcite,@xcite . the description of this level is still expected to be complex , as quantum descriptions are supposed to be @xcite .",
    "can one interpret then classically the expected presence of particles and antiparticles without explicitly using the concept of macroscopic time ? in order to deal with this question",
    ", we find it appropriate to recall first how the classical concept of background time was originally introduced .      in classical approaches with background time",
    ", position is viewed as a function of time @xmath5 , while its change @xmath6 is thought of as occurring in time , _ ` due ' _ to its increase : @xmath7 . however",
    ", a deeper insight undermines this concept of background time .",
    "rather , it views time as an effective parameter that somehow parametrizes _ change _ , as stated by ernst mach ( see motto ) .    in @xcite barbour",
    "described how energy conservation ( in an isolated system ) serves as a key ingredient that leads to a definition of an increment of ephemeris time through observed changes : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are measured changes in the positions of astronomical bodies , @xmath10 is total ( and fixed ) energy and @xmath11 is the gravitational potential of all interacting bodies of the system .",
    "thus , the ( astronomical ) time is defined by change , not vice versa .",
    "a more neutral expression of the relation between an increment of time @xmath12 and changes of position @xmath9 is that the two are correlated .",
    "it is then up to us to decide which of the two alternative formulations to choose : change in ( background ) time , or time defined from ( observed ) change .",
    "+ now , in full analogy with eq .",
    "( [ encons ] ) , it is natural to consider @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total ( and conserved ) momentum of the system . for the sake of our discussion ,",
    "we restrict the above equation to the one - particle case @xmath15 and observe that , again , one may view this relation in two ways : + 1 ) either with momentum @xmath16 calculated from the change of position @xmath6 in a given increment of ( background ) time @xmath12 , or + 2 ) with time increment @xmath12 calculated from given @xmath16 and @xmath6 .",
    "+ the latter standpoint - in which momentum is not calculated from a change in position but assumed as independent of position - is familiar from the hamiltonian formalism , in which momenta and positions are treated as independent variables .",
    "thus , the idea of time induced by change should be expressible in the language of phase space in which the macroscopic arena is not 3- but 6- dimensional .",
    "furthermore , with independent @xmath16 and @xmath17 one may consider various independent transformations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for example , study the symmetries of the time - defining equation eq.([tdef ] ) .",
    "then , standard 3d reflection corresponds to @xmath18 ( and leaves time untouched ) , while the operation @xmath19 leads to time reflection : @xmath20 .",
    "+ moving now to the quantum description we observe that the canonical commutation relations naturally involve the imaginary unit ( we use units in which @xmath21 ) : @xmath22=i \\delta_{kl}.\\ ] ] in spite of containing @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) does not involve time explicitly .",
    "consequently , since charge and complex conjugations are related , it should be possible to give an interpretation to the particle - antiparticle degree of freedom using the phase - space concepts of positions and momenta alone , i.e. without referring to the concept of explicit time .",
    "charge conjugation should then be seen not only as connected to time reversal , but also as just one of several possible transformations in phase space .",
    "in the standard picture with background spacetime there is a connection between the properties of the background ( e.g. under 3d rotation ) and the existence of the ` spatial ' quantum numbers ( e.g. spin ) .",
    "therefore , if one is willing to enlarge the arena to that of phase space , with independent position and momentum coordinates , one might expect the appearance of additional quantum numbers @xcite . from the point of view of the standard ( 3d space + time ) formalism , such quantum numbers would necessarily appear ` internal ' .",
    "the issue of a possible relation between particle properties ( such as quantum numbers or masses ) , and the concept of phase space was of high concern already to max born . in his 1949 paper @xcite",
    "he discussed the difference between the concepts of position and momentum for elementary particles and noted that the notion of mass appears in the relation @xmath24 , while @xmath25 , the corresponding invariant in coordinate space ( with @xmath25 of atomic dimensions ) , does not seem to enter in a similar relation . at the same time , born stressed that various laws of nature such as @xmath26=i\\delta_{kl},\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } l_{kl}=x_kp_l - x_lp_k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are invariant under the ` reciprocity ' transformation : @xmath27 noting that relation @xmath24 is not invariant under this transformation , he concluded : _ `",
    "this lack of symmetry seems to me very strange and rather improbable'_.    the simplest phase - space generalization of the 3d ( nonrelativistic ) concepts of rotation and reflection is obtained with a symmetric treatment of the two o(3 ) invariants , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , via their addition ( obviously , this procedure requires an introduction of a new fundamental constant of nature of dimension [ momentum / distance ] ) : @xmath30 eq.([basicinv ] ) is invariant under @xmath31 transformations and born reciprocity in particular .",
    "we may now treat @xmath17 and @xmath16 as operators , and require their commutators to be form invariant .",
    "the original @xmath31 symmetry is then reduced to @xmath32 .",
    "the appearance of the symmetry group present in the standard model leads us to ask the question whether phase - space symmetries could possibly lie at the roots of sm symmetries .",
    "as shown in @xcite and also argued below , this seems quite possible .",
    "our present theories are standardly divided into classical and quantum ones . yet , as stressed by finkelstein , the latter should be more appropriately regarded as belonging to a mixed , classical - quantum type . in finkelstein s view , the classical ( c ) , and classical - quantum ( cq ) theories should give way to a purely quantum ( q ) approach in which infinities would not appear and the concept of infinite and infinitely divisible background space would no longer exist @xcite .",
    "this view is clearly in line with the arguments for a background - independent approach to quantum gravity .",
    "the dirac linearization prescription may be thought of as a procedure that has led us from the classical description of nature to part of its quantum description .",
    "indeed , the linearization of @xmath29 leads to the appearance of pauli matrices , which describe spin at the quantum level .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to apply dirac s idea to the phase - space invariant of eq.([basicinv ] ) . using anticommuting matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) ( for more details , see @xcite ) one finds @xmath36 the first term on the r.h.s . ,",
    "@xmath37 , appears thanks to the anticommutation properties of @xmath33 and @xmath38 .",
    "the other term , @xmath39 , appears because @xmath40 and @xmath41 do not commute .",
    "these two terms sum up to a total @xmath42 .",
    "when viewed from finkelstein s perspective , the invariant @xmath43 connects then the cq - level of phase space ( noncommuting positions @xmath17 and momenta @xmath16 ) with the presumably purely q - level structure : the clifford algebra built from matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "just as @xmath46 is quantized , so is @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we have to find the eigenvalues of @xmath39 . for better correspondence with the standard definitions of internal quantum numbers , we introduce operator @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the 7-th anticommuting element of the clifford algebra .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath50 ( @xmath35 ) are @xmath51 . the resulting pattern of possible eigenvalues of @xmath47 is shown in table [ table2 ] .    in @xcite",
    "a conjecture was put forward that the electric charge @xmath52 is proportional to operator @xmath53 , evaluated for the lowest level of @xmath46 , i.e. : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the above equation is known under the name of the gell - mann - nishijima relation ( with @xmath57 of eigenvalues @xmath58 known as weak isospin and y of eigenvalues @xmath59 known as weak hypercharge ) and is considered to be a law of nature .",
    "it summarizes the pattern of charges of all eight leptons and quarks from a single sm generation . in the phase - space approach it",
    "is _ derived _ as a consequence of phase - space symmetries .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the pattern in which the weak hypercharge @xmath47 is built out of ` partial hypercharges ' @xmath50 corresponds _ exactly _ to the pattern in which electric charges are built in the harari - shupe ( hs ) model of quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "the hs approach describes the structure of a sm generation with the help of a composite model : it builds all eight fermions of a single generation from two spin-@xmath60 ` rishons ' @xmath11 and @xmath61 of charges 0 and + 1/3 .",
    "the proposed structure of leptons and quarks is shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "lllllllll & _ e  & u_r  & u_g  & u_b  & e^+  & |d_r  & |d_g  & |d_b   + & vvv&vtt&tvt&ttv&ttt&tvv&vtv&vvt    ' '' ''     + q   &  0&+&+&+&+1 & + & + & +    ' '' ''     + y   & -1&+&+&+&+1 & -&-&-    ' '' ''     +    our phase - space approach not only reproduces exactly the successful part of the rishon structure , but it also removes all the main shortcomings of the hs model . in particular , the approach is _ preonless _ , i.e. the phase - space ` rishons ' are components of charge ( hypercharge ) only , with _ no interpretation in terms of spin 1/2 subparticles_. thus , there is no problem of rishon confinement .",
    "consequently , our leptons and quarks are viewed as pointlike , in perfect agreement with the experimental knowledge . in summary",
    ", the phase - space approach explains the origin of the observed symmetries without introducing any subparticles .",
    "one might object that the nontrivial combination of spatial and internal symmetries is forbidden by the coleman - mandula no - go theorem @xcite . yet , this theorem is neatly evaded by our construction : the theorem works at the s - matix level , while quarks are to be confined , as we expect and as will be argued later on .",
    "furthermore , no additional dimensions ( standardly understood ) have actually been added in our framework .",
    "the only change was a shift in the conceptual point of view : instead of a picture based on 3d space and time , we decided to view the world in terms of a picture based on the 6d arena of canonically conjugated positions and momenta .",
    "the linearized phase - space approach suggests that the clifford algebra of nonrelativistic phase space occupies an important place in our description of leptons and quarks ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one would like to use it also in a description of composite systems , in particular in the description of hadrons as composite systems of quarks .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to achieve this goal . yet , the q - level construction in question must be related to the c - level description of nature , and , consequently , should be interpretable at the purely classical level . indeed , as niels bohr said : _",
    "` however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation , the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms'_. in fact , eq.([qandcqconnection ] ) provides the required connection through which transformations between leptons , quarks , and their antiparticles are related to those in phase space .",
    "now , in any description of composite systems , be it at the classical or the quantum level , an important ingredient is provided by the tacitly assumed concept of additivity . indeed , additivity is assumed both at the quark level ( e.g. additivity of spins or flavour quantum numbers ) , and at the classical level ( e.g. additivity of momenta ) .",
    "the question then appears : can this property of the additivity of momenta at the classical level be somehow used to infer about the properties of such q - level objects as our quarks when these are viewed from the macroscopic classical perspective .",
    "the relevant basic macroscopic observation is that for any direction in 3d space , and completely regardless of what happens in the remaining two directions , we have the _ additivity of physical momenta of any number of ordinary particles or antiparticles , quite irrespectively of their internal quantum numbers _ ( e.g. @xmath62 ) .",
    "( by ordinary particles we mean those that can be oberved _ individually _ , such as leptons and hadrons , but not quarks .",
    ") note that the positions of ordinary particles are not additive in such a simple way , since a composite object is best described in terms of its center - of - mass coordinates : @xmath63 . in the following",
    ", we shall present the connections between lepton - quark and phase - space transformations and discuss their implications for the concept of the additivity of momenta .      in a quantum description the transition from particles to antiparticles is effected by complex conjugation .",
    "consider now a system of particles in which some are being transformed into antiparticles .",
    "we want to find the related transformation in phase space .",
    "we note that in order to preserve the principle of the additivity of physical momenta , one is not allowed to change the momenta of any of the particles being transformed .",
    "the invariance of @xmath64=i\\delta _ { kl}$ ] requires then that @xmath65 using the invariance of eq.([qandcqconnection ] ) , the ensuing transformations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the definition of @xmath52 , @xmath57 , and @xmath47 , one can check @xcite that in this way we are indeed led from particles to antiparticles .",
    "thus , in the phase - space picture , with time regarded as secondary , the antiparticles are related to particles via @xmath66 combined with the reflection of position space ( with the time reflection @xmath20 induced via the invariance of eq.([tdef ] ) ) .",
    "similarly , one checks @xcite that isospin reversal @xmath67 corresponds to the transformation @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , and , consequently , to @xmath70 and @xmath71 . yet , this is not the same as charge conjugation since in this case , with @xmath72 , the momentum - position commutation relations do not stay invariant",
    ".    in summary , the phase - space representations of both the particle - antiparticle transformation and of the isospin reversal may be ( and have been ) chosen in a way that does not affect the momenta of any of the particles , thus preserving their additivity .",
    "transformations from the lepton to the quark sector ( in particular , the change @xmath73 ) require the use of so(6 ) rotations going outside those generated by the familiar @xmath74 generators of @xmath75 .",
    "the remaining six of the fifteen so(6 ) generators form two su(3 ) triplets , of which only one actually leads to transformations of some @xmath33 into @xmath76 , while keeping @xmath23 and @xmath57 fixed @xcite .    under these transformations ,",
    "@xmath44 is changed into some @xmath77 , and @xmath45 into some @xmath78 , with @xmath79 being the colour index @xcite .",
    "for the transformed elements @xmath77 ( and similarly for @xmath78 ) one can then choose the following ( not unique ) representation : @xmath80 & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } a_1&-b_3&+b_2\\\\ + b_3&a_2&-b_1\\\\ -b_2&+b_1&a_3 \\end{array } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the quark _ canonical momenta _ @xmath81 ( and likewise , for quark canonical positions @xmath82 ) , obtained from the condition of the invariance of eq.([qandcqconnection ] ) : @xmath83 & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc }",
    "p^1_{1}&-x^1_{3}&+x^1_{2}\\\\ + x^2_{3}&p^2_{2}&-x^2_{1}\\\\ -x^3_{2}&+x^3_{1}&p^3_{3 } \\end{array } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above forms of @xmath84 and @xmath85 remain unchanged for quarks of opposite isospin .    for the antiquarks , the relevant forms are @xmath86,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again ,",
    "these forms are independent of isospin .",
    "as expected , the difference between quarks and antiquarks is represented by a change in sign in front of physical positions entering into the definitions of quark ( antiquark ) canonical momenta .",
    "_ if _ additivity of canonical momenta of quarks is a proper generalization of the additivity of physical momenta for leptons and other individually observable particles , then - on account of the relative ( positive and negative ) signs between position components in ( [ canmomrepresentation ] ) and ( [ canmomantiquarks ] ) - this additivity ( separately in each of the relevant phase - space directions ) leads to translationally invariant string - like expressions for quark - antiquark and three - quark systems ( i.e. @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) , but not for @xmath92 or @xmath93 systems .",
    "additivity of canonical momenta leads therefore to the formation of ` mesons ' and ` baryons ' only .    in principle , the chain of arguments leading to eq .",
    "( [ quarkrepresentation],[canmomrepresentation ] ) could involve ordinary reflections , e.g @xmath94 , _ before _ putting the latter expression and its cyclic counterparts together into a matrix form similar to ( [ quarkrepresentation ] ) ( ` grouping ' ) . the corresponding phase - space counterparts would then look somewhat different , i.e. @xmath95 etc .",
    "the translational invariance of three - quark systems could then not be achieved by simply adding the appropriate canonical momenta of different quarks , because all physical position coordinates would enter an analog of ( [ canmomrepresentation ] ) with positive signs .",
    "the point , however , is that one _ may _ choose the ordering of the operations of grouping and reflection in such a way that - by the simple procedure of addition - the translational invariance can be achieved at all .",
    "furthermore , it seems nontrivial that this requires collaboration of phase - space representatives of quarks of three different colours .",
    "after all , the latter were originally defined - _ in a way seemingly independent of the concept of additivity _ - via a diagonalization procedure performed at the clifford algebra level .",
    "in other words , the q - level structure of coloured quark charges corresponds to a specific picture in the macroscopic arena . according to this picture ,",
    "individual quarks are not observable at the classical level since their individual canonical momenta are not translationally invariant . on the other hand , translational invariance",
    "may be restored via the collaboration of quarks of different colours . when viewed from our classical point of view ,",
    "the resulting composite systems possess standard particle - like properties , while at the same time exhibiting internal string - like features .",
    "thus , quark unobservability is supposed to be connected to the very emergence and nature of space and time .",
    "speaking more precisely , quarks are supposed to be unobservable because space and phase space are most probably just convenient classical abstractions , into the descriptive corset of which we try to force various pieces of reality .    the often - used argument that ` space is standard ' at the distances a few orders of magnitude smaller than proton s size is not sufficiently sound .",
    "after all , the existence of long - distance nonlocal quantum correlations indicates that - at least for some purposes - our classical spacetime concepts ( into which we try to force our descriptions of elementary particles ) are inadequate at much larger scales .",
    "in fact , statements about an ` unchanged nature of space ' at a distance of @xmath96 or so follow from the success of the standard model ( a cq - level theory ) and are strictly valid only _ within _ the description it provides , not outside of it ( e.g. not in a q - level theory in which space is to be an emergent concept only ) .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the phase - space approach has the capability of describing the phenomenon of quark unobservability in a way seemingly different from the sm flux - tube picture of confinement .",
    "in fact , however , the phase - space approach does not have to be in conflict with the latter picture , just as the faraday picture of ` real ' fundamental field lines is not in conflict with the maxwell concept of fields .",
    "rather , we regard the idea of the linearized phase space as offering a possible q - level starting point . our discussion is based on the invariance of eq .",
    "( [ qandcqconnection ] ) which provides a link between q- and cq- ( c- ) levels of description . obviously , however , eq . ( [ qandcqconnection ] )",
    "does not specify how the macroscopic background phase space actually emerges from the underlying quantum level .",
    "hence , at present there is no way to compare our ideas directly with the standard , background - dependent , qcd - based picture of confinement .",
    "the linearized phase - space approach differs markedly from the standard frameworks , in particular from the @xmath97-based unifications .",
    "a brief comparison of some differences between the two schemes is given in table [ table3 ] .",

    "although overly simplistic , satisfies an important philosophical condition : the necessity to connect the q - level description of elementary particles to the c - level description of the macroscopic world .",
    "one can hear the echoes of this condition in the words of roger penrose , who stated in @xcite : _ `",
    "i do not believe that a real understanding of the nature of elementary particles can ever be achieved without a simultaneous deeper understanding of the nature of spacetime .

    "rather , it should be thought of as a possible deeper layer of description only .",
    "however , it has encouraging features , which - as i believe - will show up at the classical level if derived ` in an emergent way ' from any suitable q - level description .",
