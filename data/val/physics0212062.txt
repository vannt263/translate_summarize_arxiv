    "while spectroscopy has many attractive features for experimental studies in large clusters , several difficulties pave the way for efficient theoretical approaches .",
    "firstly , because of the numerous degrees of freedom , a fully quantum calculation of the absorption spectrum by exact methods ( wavepacket or diagonalization in a basis ) is not feasible beyond a few atoms and one is usually lead to simplify the problem .",
    "a common approximation is the condon hypothesis , which assumes vertical transitions .",
    "secondly , the equilibrium properties at finite temperature require some sampling of the ground state potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "this sampling can be hard to get because of the topography of the multidimensional pes ( the so - called energy landscape ) .",
    "when the energy landscape is complicated or has multiple funnels , the relaxation to equilibrium may be particularly slow with a glassy - like behavior.@xcite broken ergodicity is then likely to occur in conventional molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , and also in quantum simulations .",
    "fortunately some remedies to this problem have recently been suggested , including multicanonical ensemble sampling@xcite or parallel tempering.@xcite thirdly , most experiments involving chromophore - doped rare - gas clusters take place at low temperatures , at which the classical approximation may be questioned , especially for the lighter elements neon and helium .",
    "path - integral monte carlo or centroid md should then be used instead of classical techniques , however their use with ergodicity restoring strategies remains numerically demanding for systems containing tens or hundreds degrees of freedom .",
    "we have recently proposed an alternative way of calculating thermodynamical observables at canonical equilibrium , using the superposition approximation of quantum oscillators.@xcite this method , originally developed for thermodynamical observables only , was improved phenomenologically by including anharmonic corrections,@xcite and extended to generally treat other temperature - dependent observables.@xcite its main interest is to circumvent the troubles of broken ergodicity by considering separately the contribution of each isomer to the partition function .",
    "the method also naturally describes quantum delocalization in a straightforward way .    one goal of this paper is to extend the quantum superposition method to the realm of calculating photoabsorption spectra . in addition to the ingredients presently available",
    ", one needs to calculate the photoabsorption spectrua of each stable isomer . for this",
    ", we use a recent theory by wadi and pollak@xcite that we have extended to the general case of arbitrary potential surfaces .",
    "as will be seen below , this gaussian theory of absorption succeeds in predicting absorption line shapes , widths and shifts for harmonic polyatomic molecules in good agreement with highly accurate monte carlo data .    with the quantum superposition method , we are able to carry out systematic studies for a given set of cluster sizes",
    ". we can then address our second goal , and try to relate the features of the absorption spectrum to the knowledge of isomerizations and possible phase changes inside the cluster . more specifically , by looking at particular sizes we hope to gain insight in the relationship between structure , temperature , quantum delocalization , and the shape and position of the spectral lines .",
    "this work follows previous efforts aimed at interpreting experimental absorption spectra on large caar@xmath0 clusters.@xcite the spectroscopy of the caar diatomic molecule has been investigated both experimentally and with _ ab initio _ calculations in ref .  , and a diatomic - in - molecules ( dim ) hamiltonian was constructed to model the @xmath9 ground- and @xmath10 excited - states of caar@xmath0 clusters.@xcite in the present context of finite - temperature spectroscopy , the heavy numerical cost of statistical sampling is balanced with this relatively cheap , albeit accurate hamiltonian .",

    "even though the resulting partition function ( [ eq : zreweight2 ] ) should not depend on the classical or quantum nature of the simulation , some differences can be seen when using semiclassical simulations including quantum corrections.@xcite this reweighting procedure has been shown to improve significantly the predictions of the superposition method . in particular , wales was able to obtain a s - bend in the kinetic temperature of ar@xmath35,@xcite as seen previously in simulations.@xcite    the other important limitation of the method is the harmonic approximation used to calculate @xmath36 .",

    "however , at this point , we can not tell whether the visible shifts and broadenings are an effect of temperature only , or of the different spectroscopic signatures of the other isomers present .",
    "some shifts in the peaks remain slightly approximate in the superposition approach , and the second - order corrected weights only marginally improve the results . at 25  k , quantum effects turn out to be rather small on the line width and shape , but they may be more important on the weights of the isomers , as will be seen below .",
    "therefore , from fig  [ fig : caar37 ] we see that anharmonic corrections to the isomers weights have a relatively weak influence for quasiclassical clusters .",
    "more information on the importance of these corrections will be gained by looking at the thermodynamical curves in the next section .    to 7 cm",

    "as expected , they get smaller and smaller as temperature increases , and becomes barely visible above 25  k.    therefore , in these two small clusters , absorption spectroscopy seems to be an effective mean of detecting isomerization events , as the range of variation in the spectrum approximately matches the width of the heat capacity changes .",
    "as cluster size grows , one can thus expect to see sharper transitions , and to possibly use the calcium chromophore as a probe of the argon cluster melting point .",
    "we have chosen a set of sizes in the range @xmath114 , spanning between 1 and 2 icosahedral layers , and which are likely to exhibit significant finite size effects .",

    "as expected , anharmonic corrections do have a positive quantitative effect by bringing the superposition data closer to the simulation results .",
    "however , no new qualitative feature is visible when they are taken into account .",
    "all heat capacities exhibit a main peak indicative of the solidlike - liquidlike phase change.@xcite this peak is located near 4045  k for caar@xmath81 , caar@xmath108 and caar@xmath82 , and near 20  k for caar@xmath75 .",

    "these features are indicative of preliminary isomerization resulting from solid - solid transitions in these clusters.@xcite again , they bear similarities with the known finite temperature behavior of lj clusters with the same size.@xcite in caar@xmath81 , the quantum character of the specific heat hides again a shoulder in the classical curve , as is the case in caar@xmath97 . this cluster happens to have a much larger number of stable isomers than ar@xmath116 .",
    "in particular the capped icosahedron can be found with the calcium atom either in adatom location ( lowest energy structure ) or inside the icosahedral shell , resulting in a set of 4 different isomers slightly higher in energy .",
    "structures not based on the capped icosahedron , or with the calcium atom in the center of the icosahedron , are less stable than these five geometries .",
    "therefore the energy spectrum of local minima can be put into three sets , one being the global minimum only , one being the other capped icosahedral isomers with calcium in the icosahedral shell , and all other isomers not build on the capped icosahedron motif .",
    "because of these three sets , the melting process involves essentially two steps . in fig .",
    "[ fig : isom](a ) we plot the probabilities of finding the caar@xmath81 cluster in its ground state , or in one of the 4 subsequent isomers , or in the remaining , liquid configurations .",
    "these probabilities are computed using the anharmonic corrected quantum partition functions .",
    "they display a clear two - step isomerization pattern . in the first step , at about 30  k ,",
    "the calcium atom is able to leave its capping site in favor of one of the twelve icosahedral sites .",
    "then , above 40  k , more disordered structures become thermally available the melting peak takes place .",
    "in caar@xmath108 the preliminary solid - solid transition near @xmath117  k involves polyicosahedral and multilayer icosahedral isomers , as in ar@xmath118.@xcite even though caar@xmath75 does not have the same global minimum as ar@xmath112 , a similar thermodynamic behavior occurs .",
    "we have calculated from the harmonic superposition approximation the probabilities of finding the cluster either in its decahedral ground state isomer , in its ( mackay - type ) icosahedral isomers , or in any of the remaining isomers .",
    "the variation of these probabilities with increasing temperature are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : isom](b ) .",
    "they show that the transition at about 5  k is due to a global decahedral - icosahedral rearrangement , and bears some similarity with the ( c@xmath119)@xmath116 cluster.@xcite the anti - mackay and truncated octahedral structures are only marginally populated at thermal equilibrium , and the main heat capacity peak is associated with the emergence of a large number of disordered configurations .",

    "the various peaks merge into a double - peak structure , where the peak at 23800  @xmath74 dominates the one at 24750  @xmath74 . here",
    "we find a clear thermodynamical influence on the spectroscopic properties .",
    "hence , in this cluster , the absorption spectrum contains notable informations about isomerization and phase changes , including some rather fine details on the characteristic temperatures .",
    "the equilibrium geometry of caar@xmath82 is a double layer mackay icosahedron where the ca atom is located on a vertex site , thus keeping a relatively high symmetry ( c@xmath111 ) . as in ar@xmath35 ,",

    "this cluster has a huge number of isomers , and many high lying minima are missed during the quenching process . in the vast majority of structures in our sample",
    "the calcium atom remains in the outer argon layers .",

    "this transition is correlated with fluctuations in the location of the calcium atom over the cluster surface .",
    "on the other hand , melting at 55  k does not lead to any visible change in the absorption spectrum .",
    "the above results may not be immediately amenable to experimental comparison , because of the problem of size selection .",
    "our simulation results show that complex isomerizations involving strong changes in the local environment of calcium could be , in principle , detected in experiments on size - selected clusters initially thermalized .",
    "however a typical sample of clusters in molecular beams is made of a broad size distribution , where the width and the center have values close to each other .",
    "the common feature of these clusters is the surface location of the calcium atom , and we may expect the absorption spectrum to be a possible probe of surface melting in these clusters , provided that the surface melting temperature does not significantly depend on cluster size . even though calcium in bulk argon has a very distinct , three - peak spectroscopic signature,@xcite it may be hard to detect volume melting in which calcium would be fully solvated .",
    "in fact , such van der waals clusters evaporate atoms at temperature close to the melting point . from a statistical point of view",
    ", the weakly bonded calcium atom is likely to evaporate first .",
    "in addition the situations where calcium is fully solvated are less probable .",
    "therefore the true volume melting transition occuring with full solvation of calcium may hardly be observed .",
    "provided that one could size - select these clusters , we have shown in the present work that spectroscopy can possibly probe their phase changes .",
    "more generally , intricate finite size effects in the thermodynamical behavior could be expected to be seen , as in caar@xmath81 , caar@xmath108 or caar@xmath75 . in these special clusters , coexisting isomers and multiple phase - likes induce complex variations of the absorption properties with increasing temperature .",
    "even with experimental setups involving selected sizes , another problem may come into play to hinder one from getting the complex spectroscopic information .",
    "all the above results are supposed to be at thermal equilibrium , without assuming how this equilibrium state had been reaching . in some cases ,",

    "melting involves the calcium atom taking place of one argon atom in the icosahedral shell .",
    "in contrast with most other sizes , it is associated with the appearance of a new absorption peak . in caar@xmath82 and caar@xmath103 ,",
    "preliminary surface melting occurs at nearly 30  k , and is reflected in the absorption spectrum . in all these phenomena , the local environment of calcium changes rather abruptly , resulting usually in clear shifts in some absorption peaks .",
    "volume melting towards a calcium atom fully solvated by argon has a potentially significant spectral signature , however calcium is less bound to argon than argon itself , hence it is likely to dissociate before volume melting occurs .",
    "one should mention that the main heat capacity peak indicates melting of the argon cluster host , especially for large sizes . while the host cluster is liquidlike the calcium is still free , to some extent , to glide over the cluster surface .",
    "being in this state , the rearrangements inside the argon cluster have little impact on the global spectroscopy of the chromophore , and the system can be expected to behave as a pseudo diatomics ca  ar@xmath0 .",
