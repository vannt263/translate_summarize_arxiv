    "a 1200 secs v - band image ( their fig .",
    "4 ) reveals that this object is a star cluster very well resolved .",
    "the authors comment that _ it is a cluster of blue stars with a distant galaxy cluster in the background_. this is probably the reason for which whiting  1 has later on classified as a galactic open cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "however its faintness and the particular location in the milky way in the anticenter direction at @xmath10 cast some doubts on its open cluster nature .",
    "+ in this paper we provide new photometric data with the aim to clarify the cluster nature and to derive the first estimates of its fundamental parameters .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "2 illustrates the observation and reduction strategies .",
    "an analysis of the geometrical structure and star counts in the field of the cluster are presented in sect .  3 , whereas a discussion of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) is performed in sect .",
    "5 deals with the determination of clusters reddening , distance and age and , finally , sect .",
    "6 summarizes our findings .",
    "@xmath11 ccd @xmath0 observations were carried out with the eight ccd camera on - board the 1 . 0 m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio , chile ) , in the nights of december 15 to 16 , 2004 . with a pixel size of @xmath12 , and a ccd size of 512 @xmath13 512 pixels ,",
    "this samples a @xmath14 field in the sky .",
    "+ the details of the observations are listed in table  1 where the observed fields are reported together with the exposure times , the average seeing values and the range of air - masses during the observations . figs .",
    "1 shows a 900 secs i band image of the area of whiting  1 . in the figure east is up , and north on the right .",
    "+ the data have been reduced with the iraf packages ccdred , daophot , allstar and photcal using the point spread function ( psf ) method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two nights turned out to be photometric and very stable , and therefore we derived calibration equations for all the 130 standard stars observed during the two nights in the @xcite fields sa  95 - 41 , pg  0231 + 051 , rubin  149 , rubin  152 , t  phe and sa  98 - 670 ( see table  1 for details ) .",
    "the calibration equations turned out of be of the form : + @xmath15 + @xmath16 + @xmath17 , + where @xmath0 are standard magnitudes , @xmath18 are the instrumental ones and @xmath19 is the airmass ; all the coefficient values are reported in table  2 .",
    "the standard stars in these fields provide a very good color coverage .",
    "the final _ r.m.s .",
    "_ of the calibration are 0.049 , 0.034 and 0.033 for the b , v and i filter , respectively .",
    "photometric errors have been estimated following @xcite .",
    "it turns out that stars brighter than @xmath20 mag have internal ( allstar output ) photometric errors lower than 0.10  mag in magnitude and lower than 0.18  mag in color .",
    "the final photometric catalog for whiting  1 ( coordinates , b , v and i magnitudes and errors ) consists of 1757 stars and are made available in electronic form at the webda site maintained by j .-",

    "@xcite report a preliminary estimate of whiting  1 diameter amounting to 1.2 arcmin . by inspecting fig",
    "1 we can recognize that dias et al . estimate is surely a reasonable one . + since our photometry covers entirely the clusters area and part of the surroundings , we performed star counts to obtain an improved estimate of the clusters size .",
    "+ we derived the surface stellar density by performing star counts in concentric rings around the clusters nominal center and then dividing by their respective surfaces .",
    "poisson errors have also been derived and normalized to the corresponding surface .",
    "poisson errors in the field star counts turned out to be very small , and therefore we are not going to show them . the final radial density profile for whiting  1 is shown in fig .  2 as a function of v magnitude .",
    "the contribution of galactic disk field has been estimated by considering all the stars in the corresponding magnitude bin , located outside 1.6 arcmin from the cluster center , and by normalizing counts over the adopted area .",
    "+ the cluster seems to be populated by stars of magnitude in the range @xmath21 , where it clearly emerges from the background . in this magnitude",
    "range the radius is not larger than 0.5 arcmin . in conclusion",
    ", we are going to adopt the value of 0.5 arcmin as whiting  1 radius throughout this paper .",
    "this estimate is in good agreement with the value of 1.2 arcmin reported by @xcite for the cluster diameter .",
    "in fig . 3 we present the cmds of whiting  1 for all the detected stars . in the left panel of the same figure",
    "we show the cmd in the @xmath22 vs @xmath23 plane , whereas in the right panel we show the cmd in the @xmath22 vs @xmath24 plane .",
    "these cmds are not very easy to be interpreted , due to the faintness of the stars .",
    "however we can recognize a wide main sequence ( ms ) in both the cmds , extending from @xmath25 , where the turn off point ( to ) is located down to @xmath26 .",
    "the upper part of the cmd is more confused .",
    "it seems that a sub - giant branch ( sgb ) is actually present , and that the red giant branch ( rgb ) starts rising at @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the rgb however is poorly populated .",
    "a group of stars at @xmath29 , @xmath30 may indicate the presence of a clump .",
    "+ better information can be derived from fig .  4 , where we show the cmds of whiting  1 as a function of the distance from the cluster nominal center .",
    "here we consider only stars having errors in v - band lower than 0.15 mag ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "in the left panel all the stars are plotted , whereas in the middle panel we only plot the stars which lie within the cluster radius ( see sect  3 ) .",
    "finally , in the right panel we plot the stars outside the cluster region , to show how the galactic field toward the cluster looks like .",
    "+ interestingly , the ms in the middle panel gets much thinner , and we can locate the to at @xmath31 , @xmath32 . the rgb is scarcely populated and the presumed clump disappears .",
    "most of the stars in the left panel located in the rgb region and in the red edge of the ms come from the field shown in the right panel . in conclusion ,",
    "the overall shape of the cmd in the middle panel is reminiscent of an old cluster .",
    "in this section we provide estimates of whiting  1 basic parameters . + we start deriving a first guess of the cluster reddening by using firb maps by @xcite .",
    "we obtain e(b - v ) = 0.026 , a very low value as expected for a cluster located at high galactic latitude .",
    "+ at this point , since we do not have any other information , we have to rely on a detailed comparison between the cmd morphology and theoretical isochrones . in the following analysis we are going to adopt the padova isochrones ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ in fig .  5 and 6 we play with age and metallicity , trying to encounter the best overall fit of the cmd . + in details , in fig .  5 we keep the metallicity fixed to z=0.001 and change the age from 3.8 to 5.6 gyrs",
    ". in both the cmd the best fit",
    "is provided by the age of 4.8 gyrs ( dashed - dotted line ) which implies a reddening e(b - v)= 0.04 and e(v - i)=0.05 .",
    "the older isochrone ( 5.6 gyr ) implies an untenable e(b - v ) = 0.00 , or slightly negative , while the youngest one ( 3.8 gyr ) implies a reddening e(b - v ) = 0.12 , which is still acceptable , but the overall fit of the red part of the cmd looks very poor . + on the other hand , in fig .",
    "6 we keep the age of 4.8 gyr fixed and play with metallicity . in this case",
    "the best fit is provided by z=0.001 .",
    "the fit with a lower metal abundance is not so bad as well , while the larger metallicity isochrone poorly fits the cmd and implies a negative reddening .",
    "+ from this exercise we infer that the cluster metal abundance is around z=0.001 and the age around 5 gyrs .",
    "the best fit is therefore outlined in fig .  7 , and from this we derive a distance modulus @xmath33=18.4 and a reddening e(b - v)=0.04 .",
    "as a consequence , we obtain a heliocentric distance of about 45 kpc .",
    "the results we achieved are listed in detail in table  3 .",
    "we have presented the first ccd @xmath0 photometric study of the star cluster whiting  1 .",
    "the cmds we derive allow us to infer estimates of the cluster basic parameters , which are summarized in table  3 .",
    "+ in detail , we find that :          the combination of age , position and metallicity makes whiting  1 a very puzzling object .",
    "+ we can rule put the hypothesis of an old open cluster , because of the low metal content , and mostly beacuse of its positions .",
    "+ the cluster bears some similarities with palomar  1 ( @xcite ) , an 8 gyr old globular cluster , and other transitional clusters like terzan  7 , ruprech  106 and others mentioned in @xcite . + following the kind of discussion by @xcite",
    ", we here tentatively propose that whiting  1 is the milky way youngest globular cluster insofar known , although a clear explanation for its formation and evolution remains very challenging .",
