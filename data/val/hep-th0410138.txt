    "therefore , the function @xmath140 becomes holomorphic in the asymptotic part of all the branches .",
    "we call this property `` asymptotic holomorphy '' . in terms of real variables ,",
    "the holomorphy of the function @xmath140 is represented by the cauchy - riemann relations : @xmath146 in fact , the second equation in ( [ cr ] ) is vacuous as a condition for the asymptotic shapes of surfaces . because we are considering brane configurations which asymptotically approach confining string solutions , the asymptotic forms are always represented by the two factorized equations in ( [ factorize ] ) .",

    "the two ways of unfolding correspond to the two different topologies ( h ) and ( i ) , which can not be deformed smoothly into each other [ see fig .",
    "[ unfold.eps ] ( b ) ] . from these facts",
    ", we conclude that a four - string vertex is stable only if it satisfies the asymptotic holomorphy condition , which is equivalent to the similarity of the tension squares and the inscribed squares in the @xmath122-plane .",
    "the asymptotic holomorphy relations are not sufficient to compute the energies of baryon vertices . for this purpose",
    ", we need to find some relations that hold everywhere on branes .",
    "one possibility is to extend the asymptotic holomorphy to the entire worldvolume as they are .",
    "unfortunately , however , a numerical investigation of generated junction solutions demonstrates that this can not be done .    in the case of supersymmetric configurations , there is a technique to determine relations holding everywhere on the surface by using killing spinors . indeed , various supersymmetric embeddings of d5-branes in the mn background are obtained in ref . with this technique .",

    "the b - boundaries arise due to the cut off @xmath195 .     and its boundary .",
    "( b ) the projection on the @xmath196-plane .",
    "( c ) the projection on the @xmath122-plane . ]",
    "the a - boundaries are mapped to apices of the triangle when they are projected on the @xmath122-plane , and the coordinates @xmath144 and @xmath145 are constants on them .",
    "therefore , the a - boundaries do not contribute to the contour integral in ( [ analytice ] ) .",
    "thus , we need only consider the integral on the b - boundaries . if @xmath5 is sufficiently large , each b - boundary is mapped to a point by the projection in the @xmath196-plane .",
    "let @xmath197 be the point corresponding to the @xmath12-th b - boundary , @xmath198 .",
    "these are on the circle @xmath199 , and we can write @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a unit vector representing the direction of the @xmath12-th branch in the @xmath196-plane . if we project the b - boundaries to the @xmath122-plane , they are mapped to sides of the triangle when @xmath5 is sufficiently large .",
    "due to the similarity between this triangle and the tension triangle , which is guaranteed by the modified cauchy - riemann relations ( [ modcr ] ) , the integration measure @xmath202 on @xmath198 can be represented as @xmath203 where the signature depends on the orientation of the contour , and @xmath204 is an infinitesimal length on the @xmath12-th side of the triangle in the @xmath122-plane . combining ( [ xyab ] ) and ( [ uvab ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the energy of a junction : @xmath205 here , we have used the fact that the integral @xmath206 gives the length of the @xmath12-th side of the triangle @xmath207 and the tension formula ( [ ttheta ] ) for the mn background .",
    "the result ( [ analyticejunc ] ) implies that the energy of a junction is given by the sum of the energies of the branches and that there is no vertex contribution .",
    "now we can answer the question raised at the end of ",
    "[ ir.sec ] .",
    "although the expression ( [ eft2 ] ) seemingly depends on @xmath27 , which has no counterpart in the boundary field theory of the mn solution , @xmath94 on the right - hand side is actually zero , and the energies of the baryon vertices in fact are independent of @xmath27 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated string junctions in @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories in the context of the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "we have used the maldacena - nez and the klebanov - strassler solutions as gravity duals of the confining gauge theories .    in  [ string.sec ] we studied the balance of the tensions for three - string junctions and planar four - string junctions .",
    "we found that four - string vertices are stable only in the case that @xmath208 or @xmath151 in the mn solution .",
    "planar four - string vertices in the ks solution are always unstable .",
    "it may be interesting to generalize this consideration to non - planar junctions .    in  [ numerical.sec ] , we reported the results of numerical computations of the energies of baryon vertices , and we found that in the ks case the energies are negative , while in the mn case they almost vanish .",
    "the vanishing of the energies strongly suggests that the brane configurations in the mn background possess some analytic structure which guarantees this vanishing .",
    "indeed , we discovered relations similar to the cauchy - riemann relations for holomorphic surfaces . with the help of these relations",
    ", we analytically proved the disappearance of the energies of baryon vertices .",
    "we should emphasize that the analysis given in this paper is classical .",
    "as mentioned in  [ string.sec ] , the existence of confining strings breaks all the supersymmetries .",
    "thus , there is no mechanism to control quantum corrections , and our results are justified only in the limit of large @xmath1 and large @xmath209 , in which the background curvature is small compared to the string scale and the plank scale .    in order to investigate realistic baryons in non - supersymmetric qcd",
    ", we have to use different gravity backgrounds .",
    "for example , we can use an ads schwarzchild black hole@xcite . because the ir geometry of this solution has structure similar to the ks and mn solutions",
    ", we can study junction configurations in it in a manner similar to that used in this paper .",
    "we have treated only brane configurations embedded in the ir geometry in this paper .",
    "they can be used for highly - excited baryons , in which the endpoints of strings are separated from each other . to analyze ground - state baryons , we should consider different kinds of brane configurations that consist of a baryon vertex and only one external string going up along the @xmath3 direction to flavor branes .",
    "the external string in this case represents coincident quarks .",
    "it is important to determine whether such branes are stable , and if so , to investigate their energies and excitations .",
    "there are many interesting problems associated with brane constructions of hadrons in addition to those mentioned above .",
    "we hope to return to these issues in the near future .",
    "i would like to thank m.  bando and a.  sugamoto for motivating me to do this work .",
    "i also thank f.  koyama , h.  ooguri , s.  sugimoto and m.  tachibana for valuable discussions .",
    "this work is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for the encouragement of young scientists ( # 15740140 ) from the japan ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , and by the rikkyo university special fund for research .          to compute the energy of a d3-brane , which is represented in ( [ 2dime ] ) as an integral over a two - dimensional surface , we first triangulate the surface .",
    "we label sites by @xmath210 and each oriented link by two labels representing its two ends .",
    "the functions @xmath211 describing the shape of the surface are replaced by the variables @xmath212 on the sites , with the constraints @xmath213 and @xmath214 . to represent the flux density , we use link variables @xmath215 where the integral",
    "is carried out along the link @xmath216 .",
    "this represents the amount of flux flowing across the link @xmath216 .",
    "we define the orientation in such a way that if the arrow from site @xmath12 to @xmath217 is upward , @xmath218 represents the flux passing the link @xmath216 from left to right . by definition",
    "we have @xmath219 the area of a triangle @xmath220 is denoted by @xmath221 ( see fig .",
    "[ trigabc.eps ] ) .",
    "this area is a real positive number .",
    "we also define @xmath223 as the area of the triangle @xmath220 projected on the @xmath122-plane .",
    "this take either a positive or negative value , depending on the orientation of the triangle . @xmath221 and @xmath224 are easily represented as functions of the variables @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "given the variables @xmath225 and @xmath218 , the energy of the d3-brane is obtained as the discretized version of the energy ( [ 2dime ] ) , @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the @xmath230-component of the center of mass @xmath231 of the triangle @xmath220 , and @xmath232 is the push - forward of the electric flux density to the five - dimensional space @xmath233 , which is given by @xmath234    a discretized version of the gauss s law constraint is @xmath235 in order to find a configuration that minimizes the energy , we should vary the variables @xmath222 and @xmath218 in such manner that does not violate this gauss s law constraint .",
    "there are two kinds of variations .",
    "variations of @xmath218 with fixed @xmath225 are generated by the following variation for each site @xmath12 : @xmath236 here , @xmath237 represents the set of all the sites adjoining the site @xmath12 .",
    "this variation changes the rotation of the flux density around the site @xmath12 [ see fig .",
    "[ pentamovei.eps ] ( a ) ] .",
    "the other kind of variations are those that change @xmath225 .",
    "even when we vary the variables @xmath222 , we should take account of the gauss s law constraint ( [ gausslaw ] ) , because variations of @xmath222 change charges in triangles . if the position of a site @xmath12 moves from @xmath222 to @xmath239 , the projected area @xmath223 of the triangle @xmath220",
    "is changed by the amount @xmath240 [ see fig .",
    "[ pentamovei.eps ] ( b ) ] . to maintain the gauss s law constraint ( [ gausslaw ] )",
