    "for long time the investigation about entanglement and non - locality has been limited to quantum systems of small size @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental works on bell s inequalities have been devoted to the study of single particle states , in which dichotomic measurements have been performed @xcite .",
    "non - locality tests have been achieved with single photon states , produced by parametric down conversion , by detecting polarization correlations @xcite .",
    "more recently the violation of bell s inequality has been performed with a larger number of photons : on ghz @xcite and cluster states @xcite up to 4 photons .",
    "+ on the other hand , the possibility of observing quantum phenomena at a macroscopic level seems to be in conflict with the classical description of our everyday world knowledge .",
    "the main problem for such observation arises from the experimental difficulty of sufficiently isolating a quantum system from its environment , i.e. , from the decoherence process @xcite .",
    "an alterative approach to explain the quantum - to - classical transition , conceptually different from the decoherence program , has been given , very recently , by kofler and brukner , along the idea earlier discussed by bell , peres @xcite and others .",
    "they have given a description of the emergence of macroscopic realism and classical physics in systems of increasing size _",
    "within quantum theory _",
    "they focused on the limits of the quantum effects observability in macroscopic objects , showing that , for large systems , macrorealism arises under coarse - grained measurements .",
    "more specifically they demonstrated that , while the evolution of a large spin can not be described classically when sharp measurement are performed , a fuzzy measurement on a large spin system would induce the emergence of the newtonian time evolution from a full quantum description of the spin state .",
    "however , some counterexamples to such modelization have been found later by the same authors : some non classical hamiltonians violate macrorealism despite coarse - grained measurements @xcite .",
    "one example is given by the time - dependent schrdinger catlike superposition , which can violate macrorealism by adopting a suitable `` which emisphere '' measurement .",
    "therefore the measurement problem seems to be a key ingredient in the attempt of understanding the limits of the quantum behavior of physical systems and the quantum - to - classical transition question . as a further step , kofler , bruic and",
    "brukner also demonstrated @xcite that macrorealism does not imply a continuous spatiotemporal evolution .",
    "indeed , they showed that the same schrdinger catlike non - classical hamiltonian , in contact with a dephasing environment does not violate any longer a leggett - garg inequality , while it still presents a non - classical time evolution . in a recent paper jeong et al .",
    "@xcite contributed to the investigation about the possibility of observing the quantum features of a system when fuzzy measurement are performed on it , finding that extremely - coarse - grained measurements can still be useful to reveal the quantum world where local realism fails .    in this context , the possibility of obtaining macroscopic quantum systems in laboratory has raised the problem of investigating entanglement and non locality in systems in which single particles can not be addressed singularly . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the demonstration of non - locality in a multiphoton state produced by a non - degenerate optical parametric amplifier would require the experimental application of parity operators . on the other hand , the estimation of a coarse grained quantity , through collective measurements as the ones proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , would miss the underlying quantum structure of the generated state , introducing elements of local realism even in presence of strong entanglement and in absence of decoherence .",
    "the theoretical investigation on a multiphoton system , obtained via parametric down conversion , has been also carried out by reid et al .",
    "@xcite . they analyzed the possibility of obtaining the violation of bell s inequality by performing dichotomic measurement on the multiparticle quantum state . more specifically , in analogy with the spin formalism , they proposed to compare the number of photons polarized `` up '' with the number of photons polarized `` down '' at the exit of the amplifier .",
    "the result of this comparison could be either ( + 1 ) or ( -1 ) hence the measurement on the multiphoton state turned out to be dichotomic .",
    "in such a way reid et al . revealed a small violation of the multiparticle bell s inequality even in presence of losses and quantum inefficiency of detectors .",
    "it s worth noting that this violation presents a fast decreasing behavior as a function of the generated photons number . in a recent paper , bancal et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed different techniques for testing bell s inequalities in multipair scenarios , in which either at alice s and bob s site a global measurement is performed .",
    "they distinguished between two cases : distinguishable , i.e. independent , and indistinguishable , i.e. belonging to the same spatial and temporal mode , photon pairs .",
    "they found that while the state of indistinguishable pairs results more entangled , the state of independent pairs appears to be more nonlocal .    in the present manuscript",
    ", we investigate the macroscopic - macroscopic state generated by high gain spontaneous parametric down - conversion .",
    "the possibility of observing quantum correlations in macroscopic quantum systems through dichotomic measurement will be analyzed , by addressing two different measurement schemes , based on different dichotomization processes .",
    "more specifically , we will investigate the persistence of non - locality in an increasing size @xmath0-spin singlet state by studying the change in the correlations form as @xmath1 increases , both in the ideal case and in presence of losses . at last , experimental observation of macro - macro correlations",
    "will be reported .",
    "the results obtained enlighten that dichotomic fuzzy measurements lack of the necessary resolution to characterize such states and show the extreme difficulty to observe quantum non - locality in this experimental configuration .",
    "let us give a brief outline of the paper .",
    "section [ sec : macro_macro_system ] is devoted to the introduction of the analyzed quantum system . in section [ sec : dichotomic_meas ] , we describe two different types of dichotomic measurements on multiphoton states : the orthogonality filtering ( of ) and the threshold detection ( td ) . in section [ sec : bells_inequality ] we present the results of the numerical simulations of the correlations between dichotomic measurements carried out on the multiphoton fields produced via spontaneous parametric down conversion .",
    "we report the theoretical interference fringe - patterns for single-@xmath0 states , we observe a transition from the sinusoidal pattern of the spin-@xmath3 into a quasi - linear pattern by increasing the number of photons of the spin state . according to this behavior we observe a progressive decrease in the amount of the violation as also predicted in ref @xcite . as following step",
    ", we estimate the correlation after propagation over a lossy channel .",
    "we then analyze the response of the system to the two dichotomic measurements reported in sec.[sec : dichotomic_meas ] , discussing the feasibility of a chsh test with these detection strategies . finally , section [ sec : experimental ] is dedicated to an experimental test of the previous results .",
    "the investigation on the micro - macro transition will be performed on a paradigmatic physical system : the optical parametric amplifier working in a high gain regime .",
    "the quantum state produced in a low gain regime has been experimentally realized and deeply studied in the past few years @xcite .",
    "we are now interested in analyzing the behavior of such quantum system when the number of photons is increased and it undergoes a fuzzy measurement , in which the generated particles can not be addressed singularly , but a dichotomic measurement is performed on the overall state .",
    "more specifically , the radiation field under investigation is the quantum state obtained by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) with an epr type - ii source @xcite , whose interaction hamiltonian is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6  are the creation operators corresponding to the generation of a @xmath7-polarized photon on spatial modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as sketched in fig.[fig : conceptual_scheme_spont ] , and @xmath10 is the constant describing the strength of the interaction .",
    "the adoption of the single mode interaction hamiltonian @xmath11 to model the spdc source is valid since in our experimental setup , described in sec.[sec : experimental ] , spatial and spectral filtering are performed on the generated field .",
    "a detailed analysis of the model taking into account a broadband pump pulse can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "value is assigned if @xmath12 , and @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "finally , coincidences between the two apparata are considered.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the output state reads @xcite : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the non - linear gain ( nl ) of the process .",
    "hence , the output state can be written as the weighted coherent superposition of singlet spin-@xmath0 states @xmath19 .    as said ,",
    "this epr source has been already studied in different gain regimes .",
    "first , kwiat et al .",
    "@xcite exploited the polarization singlet - state emitted in the single - pair regime to obtain the violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "subsequent works studied the multi - photon states generated in a high gain spdc source .",
    "et al . @xcite experimentally demonstrated four - photon entanglement in the second - order emission state of the spdc source , by taking the four - fold coincidences after the two output modes of the source were splitted by 50 - 50 beam - splitters .",
    "a generalized non - locality test @xcite was also successfully performed in this configuration .",
    "a similar scheme was subsequently exploited by wieczorek et al .",
    "@xcite to experimentally generate an entire family of four - photon entangled states .",
    "the presence of polarization - entanglement in the multi - photon states up to 12 photons has been proved by studying the high losses regime where at most one photon per branch was detected @xcite .",
    "the density matrix of this two - photons state was analytically derived and experimentally investigated in a more recent work @xcite , where it has been demonstrated that it coincides with the one of a werner state ( ws ) , i.e. , a weighted superposition of a maximally entangled singlet state with a fully mixed state .",
    "simon and bouwmeester @xcite derived a criteria to quantify the entanglement of the multiphoton states produced by a high gain spdc source by measuring the stokes parameters of polarization of the beams a and b. for a high efficiency detection observation of entanglement was predicted .",
    "however , no experimental demonstration of entanglement and non - locality has been given in the multi - photon regime where the generated state does not undergo to a controlled lossy detection scheme .",
    "in the context of the investigation on entanglement and non - locality between macroscopic systems , bell s inequalities have been generalized to many particle regimes . among various strategies ,",
    "several possible extensions of dichotomic measurements in the macroscopic regime have been presented @xcite . by these methods ,",
    "chsh - type inequalities can be exploited in order to perform non - locality tests also in many - particle collective states .    in this section",
    "we analyze two possible kind of dichotomic measurements on macroscopic states , based on photon counting and signal processing techniques .",
    "the first technique is based on the orthogonality - filter ( o - filter ) device @xcite , which has already been used to test experimentally the entanglement between a microscopic and a macroscopic field .",
    "this method has several analogies with the detection strategy presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and attributed to a biological `` human eye '' detector .",
    "the second technique is a threshold dichotomic detection scheme , whose action is independent on the input state and hence can be fairly exploited for a bell s inequalities test .    .",
    "the ( + 1 ) and ( -1 ) regions correspond to a difference in the detected photon numbers @xmath20 .",
    "the ( 0 ) region corresponds to an inconclusive measurement .",
    "( b ) dichotomic threshold measurement representation in the bidimensional fock - space @xmath21 . only those pulses containing a sufficiently high photon number",
    "can be detected due to the threshold response of the apparatus .",
    "then , a dichotomic assignment is performed on the measurement outcomes .",
    "( c ) response of `` biological '' detectors , which are sensible to the impinging field only if the photon number exceeds an intrinsic threshold @xmath22.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the first dichotomic measurement technique we analyze in this section is based on the o - filter ( of ) device introduced in @xcite . in these papers the detection method allowed to discriminate among two macroscopic orthogonal states @xmath23 , obtained by the collinear parametric amplification of single - photon states with equatorial polarization @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 , by exploiting the difference in their photon number distributions .",
    "we utilize now this technique in a different experimental framework .",
    "let us now give a formal description of this measurement technique in the povm framework .",
    "first , the incident radiation is analyzed in polarization by a couple of photon - number resolving detectors on each spatial mode @xmath26 . in the ideal case",
    ", this measurement corresponds to the projection of the impinging field onto the von neumann operators : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents a quantum state with @xmath1 photons with polarization @xmath29 and @xmath30 photons with polarization @xmath31 .",
    "subsequently , the dichotomization of the measurement corresponds to assign the value ( + 1 ) if @xmath32 , ( -1 ) if @xmath33 , and ( 0 ) otherwise ( fig.[fig : measurement_schemes]-(a ) ) .",
    "this choice of the detection scheme corresponds to the povm operators : @xmath34 the discarded outcome ( gray ( 0 ) region in fig.[fig : measurement_schemes]-(a ) ) turns out to be state dependent .",
    "this property , as we shall see later , renders this kind of dichotomic measurement not fair for applications in bell s inequalities test .",
    "we now introduce a different dichotomic measurement method which is based on a threshold detection scheme .",
    "let us consider the following apparatus .",
    "as in the of case , the incident field is analyzed in polarization on each spatial mode by photon - counting detectors , and the von neumann operators that describe this intensity measurement are again the @xmath35 projectors .",
    "the dichotomization of the measurement then proceeds as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement_schemes]-(b ) ) .",
    "the ( + 1 ) outcome is assigned when the threshold condition @xmath36 is satisfied and when @xmath37 .",
    "analogously , the ( -1 ) outcome is assigned in the opposite case @xmath38 conditionally to the threshold condition : @xmath36 . if @xmath39 , one of the two outputs ( @xmath40 ) is randomly assigned with equal probability @xmath41 .",
    "the povm operators that describe the measurement can then be written in the form : @xmath42 this scheme has the peculiar property of selecting an invariant region of the fock space with respect to rotations of the polarization basis .",
    "more specifically , let us consider the case in which the measurement is performed choosing a polarization basis @xmath43 . with that choice , all the pulses for which @xmath44 are not detected .",
    "rotating the basis to @xmath45 , the undetected part of the wave function still corresponds to the application of the same threshold condition in the new basis @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the filtered fock - space region is independent on the choice of the polarization basis but is a function only of the threshold @xmath47 , which is an intrinsic property of the detection apparatus .",
    "this feature is the main difference with the of device discussed in previous section , and renders the td based detection strategy feasible for its implementation in bell s inequalities tests .",
    "in this section we perform a theoretical investigation on non - locality in a specific macroscopic quantum system analyzed with the threshold detection apparatus previously introduced .",
    "specifically , we investigate the quantum correlations between the fields associated to modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the state of eq.([eq : spdc_state ] ) by using the dichotomic measurements described in the previous section .",
    "more specifically , we derive the interference fringe pattern obtained by varying the polarization analysis basis on mode @xmath9 . as a first step ,",
    "we consider individually the singlet spin-@xmath0 states ( [ eq : singlet_n ] ) , and we subsequently extend the results to the spdc output superposition state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spdc_state ] ) . to generalize the results to a realistic detection and transmission apparatus",
    ", we numerically simulate the effect of losses and non - unitary detection efficiency in the interference fringe pattern . finally , we address the problem of non - locality by investigating a chsh inequality for this detection apparatus , studying how the amount of violation is modified by the increase in the photon s number @xmath1 .",
    "we begin our analysis on the macroscopic - macroscopic state by evaluating the correlations existing between the two spatial modes of the spin-@xmath0 singlet states ( eq.([eq : singlet_n ] ) ) .",
    "we use a pure dichotomic measurement scheme , where the ( + 1 ) and ( -1 ) outcomes are assigned whether the difference in the number of photons with two orthogonal polarization is positive or negative .",
    "finally , if the detected difference in the number of photons is @xmath48 , one of the ( @xmath49 ) outcomes is randomly assigned to the event with equal probability @xmath41 .",

    "in particular , due to the su(2 ) symmetry of the emitted states , it is sufficient to consider only the linear polarizations case , defined by the rotation : @xmath60 .",
    "the fringe patterns are then obtained by evaluating the coincidences between the outcomes of the two detection apparatus on modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "more specifically , this measurement corresponds to the evaluation of the averages : @xmath61 the calculation of this measurement has been analytically performed by expressing the singlet spin-@xmath0 states of eq.([eq : singlet_n ] ) in the analyzed polarization basis : @xmath62 where : @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the binomial coefficient .",

    "the latter represents the typical response of a pair of classicaly anti - correlated spin-@xmath71 systems , analyzed through a dichotomic `` which emisphere '' measurement @xcite , i.e. the measurement of the angular momentum sign .",
    "such detection scheme is completely analogous to the dichotomic strategy analyzed in this section .",
    "the transition with increasing @xmath1 towards a classical response for the singlet spin-@xmath0 can be explained observing that the chosen dichotomic detection scheme is no more sufficient to fully characterize the singlet spin states of increasing size @xmath72 .",
    "this measurement lacks of the necessary resolution @xcite to observe the peculiar quantum properties of these states . in other words ,",
    "this measurement scheme is not sufficient to fully extract the information encoded in the polarization anti - correlation of the singlet spin states .",
    "their characterization would require a more sophisticated detection apparatus able to discriminate the value @xmath30 of the spin projection , i.e. in our case the difference in the orthogonally polarized photon number , and not only its sign .",
    "an example of such measurement @xcite is given by the parity operator @xmath73 .",
    "the correlation between the two spatial modes of the singlet spin-@xmath0 states evaluated with this measurement operator leads to the following expression : @xmath74 } { ( n+1 ) \\sin \\theta } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this correlation function violates a chsh inequality of an amount @xmath75 @xcite even in the asymptotic limit of large number of particle ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , such scheme based on the parity operator requires a sharp photon number measurement in order to discriminate with unitary efficiency among contiguous values of the spin projection .     for singlet spin- @xmath77 states divided by a linear function @xmath78 corresponding to the behaviour of two distinct classical macroscopic objects .",
    "black continuous lines correspons to the coincidences of both the ( + 1,+1 ) and ( -1,-1 ) outcome configurations , while red dashed lines correspond to the ( + 1,-1 ) and ( -1,+1 ) outcomes on the two spatial mode .",

    "the choice of the curve @xmath81 as a reference is motivated by the following consideration .",
    "the evaluation of the chsh parameter in a system characterized by the linear response leads to the maximum value in a classical framework @xmath82 .",
    "hence , this function @xmath81 can be considered as the boundary between the `` classical '' and the `` quantum '' regions , since it represents the response of two classical anti - correlated systems to this test .",
    "in fig.[fig : fourier_spont ] , we note that the ratio @xmath79 presents a number of intersections with the axis @xmath83 ( unitary ratio ) proportional to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this depends on the explicit functional form of the interference fringe pattern of eq.([eq : int_fringe_pattern_n ] ) . indeed , analyzing the explicit expression ( eq.([eq : coeffic_rotated ] ) ) of the coefficients @xmath84",

    "is progressively reduced , since more harmonics are present in the fourier expansion which asymptotically reaches the expansion of @xmath81 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the increase in the number of photons renders the dichotomic measurement inefficient for the complete characterization of the state , and the decreased correlations become more similar to classical ones .",
    "decoherence in macroscopic systems represents the main cause for the impossibility of observing quantum phenomena in every - day life and for the realization of quantum experimental schemes . in the previous section we described a correlation experiment based on dichotomic detection in an ideal setup , where both the transmission channel and the detection apparatus possess unitary quantum efficiency",
    "however , in real setups loss in both stages must be considered .",
    "hence , the investigation on the effects of decoherence allows to understand both the transition from the quantum to the classical world and the feasibility of the schemes here presented in order to violate the bell s inequalities .    to this end",

    "( [ eq : o - filtering_povm_1]-[eq : threshold_povm_3 ] ) are linear combination of fock - state projectors , the lossy channel can be simulated numerically . more specifically , our calculation is divided in the following steps .",
    "first , for a set of angles @xmath80 of the analysis basis on spatial mode @xmath9 , we calculated the coefficients of the state @xmath90 defined in eq.([eq : coeffic_rotated ] ) .",
    "as the measurement operators are diagonal in the fock basis , the results of the measurement depend only on the diagonal part of the density matrix after losses .",
    "furthermore , the map that describes the lossy process , i.e. @xmath91 = \\sum_{k } \\gamma_{k } \\hat{a}^{k } \\hat{\\rho } \\hat{a}^{\\dag \\ , k } \\gamma^{\\dag}_{k}$ ] where @xmath92 , maps diagonal elements in diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "all these considerations allow us to focus our numerical analysis on the diagonal part of the density matrix .",
    "the numerical simulation proceeds as follows .",
    "let us for example focus our attention on the ( + 1,+1 ) joint outcome .",
    "the coefficients of the distribution @xmath93 are arranged in a matrix form , labelled by the row and column indexes @xmath94 . for each value of @xmath30 and @xmath68 , 4 binomial random number generators with average values",

    "we are now interested in observing the effects of more sophisticated povm measurements , as the threshold detection or the o - filtering methods introduced in section [ sec : dichotomic_meas ] .",
    "in particular , we analyze how both the visibility and the form of the fringe pattern are modified exploiting this different measurement schemes . the main idea beyond",
    "this approach concerns the possibility of beating the losses effects on the macro - macro correlations , by using a more sophisticated measurement than a pure dichotomic one .",
    "we first analyze the correlations obtained by the o - filtering detection scheme , introduced in section [ subsec : o - filtering_detection ] .",
    "the fringe pattern can be calculated by evaluating the average :    @xmath103    we performed a numerical simulation , in order to consider also the transmission over a lossy channel , with a procedure analogous to the one described in the previuos section .",
    "we report in fig.[fig : of_fringe ] the fringe pattern obtained for the @xmath55 singlet states for two values of the channel efficiency .",
    "we note that , as the of threshold @xmath22 is increased , the tails of the fringe pattern are damped , while the form of the fringe around the peaks remains unchanged . furthermore",
    ", both the minimum and the maximum of the fringes are lowered by this filtering procedure .",
    "to understand the advantage of this measurement scheme with respect to the pure dichotomic case , we analyze in fig.[fig : of_td_visibility_n=80 ] the trend of visibility of the fringe pattern as a function of the threshold .",
    "we note that , for increasing @xmath22 , the visibility is increased by the filtering process .",
    "this advantage obtained by exploiting the o - filtering measurement can be explained by the following considerations . in absence of losses ,",
    "the visibility of the fringe pattern is always unitary , as the analyzed state presents perfect polarization anti - correlations .",
    "after the transmission over a lossy channel , the binomial statistics added to the photon number distribution is responsible for the partial cancellation of this property . more precisely , if the difference between @xmath104 and @xmath105 on any of the two spatial mode is little , losses may invert the outcome of a dichotomic measurement , i.e. for example the ( + 1 ) outcome may be converted to the ( -1 ) outcome if unbalanced losses occur in that specific event .",
    "such a process can generate the occurrence in the joint measurement of a result with positive correlations , i.e. ( + 1,+1 ) or ( -1,-1 ) , where in the decoherence - free case only anti - correlations are present .",
    "thus , the visibility of the fringe pattern can be reduced by the presence of losses . however , to invert the outcome of matrix elements with @xmath106 , a strongly unbalanced losses in a single shot for the two polarization modes must occur .",
    "this event has a decreasing probability as the difference @xmath67 becomes larger .",
    "since the o - filter device selects these zones of the fock space which present such unbalancement , the outcome inversion becomes practically neglible and the visibility of the fringe pattern progressively returns unitary as the threshold @xmath22 is increased .",
