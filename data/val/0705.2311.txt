    "the widely - used simplification of fluid dynamics equations is an assumption of one - dimensionality of the flow .",
    "it is proposed that all unknown functions depend only on two variables : time @xmath0 and cartesian coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "motion of fluid particles is allowed in all directions , however most of interesting processes ( waves of compression and rarefaction , strong and weak discontinuities , etc . )",
    "take place along one spatial axis @xmath3 .",
    "components of the velocity vector , thermodynamical and all another unknown functions are constant on the planes @xmath2 and change from one plane to another .",
    "this solution is often referred to as fluid motion with planar waves .",
    "being comparatively easy for an analytical analysis , this simplification provides a great deal of information about qualitative properties of fluid motions .",
    "however , the classical one - dimensional solution can not describe three - dimensional processes in fluid which in fact might be significant for the correct description of the picture of the flow .    in present work",
    "we generalize the described classical one - dimensional solution with planar waves . in our solution velocity vector",
    "is decomposed into two components , one of which is parallel and another one is orthogonal to @xmath3 axis .",
    "absolute values ( lengthes ) of the components and both thermodynamical functions ( density and pressure ) are supposed to depend only on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this part of solution coincide with the classical one .",
    "however , the angle of rotation of velocity vector about @xmath3 axis is supposed to depend on all independent variables @xmath4 .",
    "presence of this function gives the desired generalization of the classical solution .",
    "the proposed representation of the solution was advised by the theory of symmetry analysis of differential equations @xcite .",
    "indeed , from the symmetry analysis point of view , the classical one - dimensional solution is an invariant one of rank 2 with respect to the admissible group of shifts along @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis . whereas the generalized solution is a partially invariant one @xcite with respect to the full group of plain isometries consisting of shifts along @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes and rotation about @xmath3 axis .",
    "class of generalized solutions is happened to be a contansive one .",
    "it is described by a closed system of pdes with two independent variables , which in the special case coincide with classical equations for one - dimensional fluid motions .",
    "the angle as a function of four independent variables is determined on solutions of the invariant system from a finite ( not differential ) relation , which has a functional arbitrariness .",
    "the finite relation allows clear geometrical interpretation .",
    "this gives opportunity to construct a desired type of fluid motion by choosing appropriate arbitrary function in the functional relation .",
    "plasma flow governed by the solution possesses a remarkable property .",
    "fluid particles belonging to the same initial plane @xmath2 at some moment of time circumscribe the same trajectories in 3d space and have identical magnetic field lines attached .",
    "however , each trajectory and magnetic field line has its own orientation , which depends on the position of the fluid particle in the initial plane .",
    "the orientation is given by the finite relation with functional arbitrariness .",
    "thus , with the same shape of trajectories and magnetic field lines one can construct infinitely many pictures of fluid motions by varying admissibly directions of particles spreading .",
    "intensively studied in recent scientific literature solution of ideal compressible or incompressible fluid equations which is called `` singular vortex '' or `` ovsyannikov vortex '' @xcite can be treated as the analogous generalization of one - dimensional motion with spherical waves . in this solution",
    "absolute values of the tangential and normal to spheres @xmath7 components of velocity vector field depend only on time @xmath0 and distance @xmath8 to the origin .",
    "an angle of rotation of the vector field about the radial direction @xmath9 is a function on all independent variables .",
    "this solution also allows symmetry interpretation as the partially invariant one with respect to the admissible group of sphere isometries , i.e. of rotations in @xmath10 .",
    "the generalized one - dimensional solution with planar waves for ideal gas dynamics equations was first obtained in @xcite .",
    "for all we known , it was not analyzed in details for its physical content . in present work",
    "we observe equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "cases of ideal gas dynamics and ideal liquid can be obtained in limits of zero magnetic field @xmath11 and constant density @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start from the formulation of the representation of solution , which is prescribed by symmetry properties of the main model of ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "substitution of the representation of the solution into the system of equations brings a highly - overdetermined system of pdes for the non - invariant function  angle of rotation of the vector fields about @xmath3 axis .",
    "investigation of the overdetermined system reveals two main cases , when some auxiliary function @xmath13 is equal or not equal to zero . from the mechanical point of view",
    "these two cases correspond to the compressible or incompressible ( divergence - free ) vector field which is obtained as a projection of the velocity field into @xmath14 plane . in both cases",
    "the overdetermined system is reduced to some compatible invariant subsystem of pdes with two independent variables and a finite implicit relation for the non - invariant function .",
    "we give geometrical interpretation of the finite relation , which allows keeping track of the singularities , which may take place in the flow .",
    "we prove that particles trajectories and magnetic field lines are planar curves",
    ". moreover , these curves are the same for all particles , which start from the same initial plane @xmath2 .",
    "this gives opportunity to construct a pattern of the trajectory and magnetic field line .",
    "the complete 3d picture of the flow is obtained by attaching the pattern to every point in fixed @xmath14 plane in accordance to the directional field defined by the finite relation for the non - invariant function .",
    "remarkable , that the same pattern of magnetic line and trajectory attached to different directional field in @xmath14 plane produces variety of pictures of plasma motion in 3d space . as an example , the solution is used for explicit description of the plasma flow in axisymmetric canal with curved conducting walls .",
    "the system of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( tension comes to pressure , thermal conductivity is zero , electric conductivity is infinite ) has the form @xcite @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the fluid velocity vector , @xmath17 is the magnetic vector field ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are pressure and density .",

    "optimal system of subgroups @xmath26 was constructed in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "examination of @xmath26 shows , that the partially invariant solution of described type is generated by 3-dimensional subgroup @xmath27 with lie algebra @xmath28 spanned by the infinitesimal generators @xmath29 ( we use the subgroups numeration according to @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , lie group @xmath30 is spanned by shifts along @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes and simultaneous rotations about the first coordinate axis in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . invariants of this group of transformations in the space of independent variables and dependent functions @xmath34 are @xmath35 the last invariant may be treated as angle @xmath36 between the projections of vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 into @xmath14 plane ( see figure [ coords ] ) .",
