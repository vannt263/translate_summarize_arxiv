    "over the past few years , the question of the nature of accretion in the vicinity of black holes has received considerably renewed attention .",
    "this interest stems from a combination of new observational data and a deeper theoretical understanding of the accretion problem . on the observational side ,",
    "significant progress has been made since a new generation of powerful x - ray telescopes ( chandra and xmm - newton ) became available .",
    "these instruments have been used to strengthen earlier claims of evidence for general relativistic effects arising deep in the potential well of spinning black holes , in the form of broad iron emission line profiles ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ; dabrowsky et al .",
    "1997 ; branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "2001 ; see also reynolds & begelman 1997 ; young , ross & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been suggested that in some systems one actually witnesses black hole spin energy being tapped to power part of the observed x - ray emission ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 , miller et al .",
    "2002 ) .    on the theoretical side , efforts to reconsider classical results ( see , e.g. , novikov & thorne 1973 ;",
    "page & thorne 1974 , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) on the marginally - stable orbit and the zero - torque boundary condition at @xmath1 have been motivated by the compelling case made for magnetic fields and mhd turbulence being the driving mechanism behind accretion ( balbus & haley 1991 ; 1998 ; balbus 2003 ; blaes 2003 ) .",
    "recent theoretical efforts on near - black - hole accretion have focused on analytical models of steady - state accretion ( krolik 1999 ; gammie 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 ; paczynski 2000 ; afshordi & paczynski 2003 ) or on global numerical simulations of magnetized flows in an approximate pseudo - newtonian potential for non - rotating black holes ( hawley & krolik 2001 ; 2002 ; reynolds & armitage 2001 , armitage , reynolds & chiang 2001 ; krolik & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "gammie & popham ( 1998 ; see their footnote 7 ) and araya - gochez ( 2002 ) have studied some important aspects of the linear stability problem for magnetized disks around black holes in full general relativity , but it seems that there has been no attempt to use this approach to address some of the debated points in the literature on the subject of near - black - hole accretion ( e.g. validity of zero - torque condition , role of disk thickness , differences between hydrodynamical and magnetized disks ) .",
    "this is undoubtedly because there are issues that a local , linear analysis can not fully address and which require global numerical simulations .",
    "nonetheless , as i argue below , such an analysis still provides valuable insights on some of the key aspects of the accretion problem in the vicinity of a black hole . in ",
    "2 , i describe the formalism used for the linear analysis .",
    "i present a comparison of results for hydrodynamical and magnetized thin accretion disks in  3 .",
    "implications and limitations of this work are discussed in  4 .",
    "we work in cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 . without loss of generality , we restrict our analysis to a basic state disk with a purely vertical magnetic field , @xmath3 , and a rotation law , @xmath4 , that is constant on cylinders .",
    "we consider axisymmetric eulerian perturbations ( denoted by a prefix @xmath5 ) with wkb space - time dependence @xmath6 .",
    "we work in ideal mhd ( i.e. microscopic diffusion processes are ignored ) and we neglect weak circulations of the basic state , such as that caused by a finite fluid viscosity .    the formalism used for this analysis is essentially the same as the one developed by balbus & hawley ( 1991 ; 2002 ) .",
    "standard mhd equations and expressions for the leading - order wkb terms ( within the boussinesq approximation ) can be found in the first of these two references .",
    "two of these equations for linear perturbations are useful for the discussion below and they are reproduced here :    [ eq : one ] - i v_+ v_r ^2 2 -i k b b_4 = 0 ,    [ eq : two ] - i b_r - i k b v_r = 0 .",
    "linear perturbations satisfy the dispersion relation    @xmath7    where    @xmath8    and @xmath9 is the mass density of the fluid .",
    "unstable modes are best characterized by their growth rate , @xmath10 . the brunt - visl  frequency and the epicyclic frequency appearing in the dispersion relation",
    "are defined , respectively , by    n^2 = -3 5 d p d r d p^-5/3 d r , ^2 = 1r^3 d r^4 ^ 2d r ,    where @xmath11 is the gas pressure and @xmath12 is the adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "following balbus & hawley ( 2002 ) , the growth rate , @xmath13 , of unstable modes obeys    [ eq : growth ] ^2= - ( k v_a ) ^2 - .",
    "the wavenumber ( @xmath14 ) and growth rate of the fastest growing mode are given by    ( k v_a ) ^2_max= ^2 ( 1- ) , _",
    "max= ( | | - ) .",
    "the @xmath15 component of the linear perturbation stress tensor , which measures the angular momentum flux associated with unstable modes ( balbus & hawley 2002 ; 1998 ) , is    t_r = , where the first term is the reynolds stress and the second term is the maxwell stress :    v_r v_= ( v_r)^2 ,    -v_ar v_a = ( v_r)^2 ,    and @xmath16 . in",
    "what follows , we will focus on the dimensionless stress    t^*_r = .    while balbus & hawley ( 2002 ; see also narayan et al .",
    "2002 ) were interested in the general stability and transport properties of accretion flows with strongly destabilizing radial stratifications ( @xmath17 ) , our specific interest here is in the possible change of stability properties caused by the gravitational potential of a non - rotating black hole in the vicinity of the classical marginally stable orbit ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we approximate the schwarzschild metric with the pseudo - newtonian potential of paczynski & wiita ( 1980 ) , which implies a keplerian rotation law    ^2_k(r ) = ,    where @xmath18 is the gravitational constant , @xmath19 is the central black hole mass and @xmath20 is the schwarzschild radius of the non - rotating hole ( @xmath21 is the speed of light ) .",
    "this approximate potential is known to reproduce accurately the location of the classical marginally - stable ( @xmath22 ) and marginally - bound ( @xmath23 ) orbits .",
    "we focus our attention on the stability of nearly - keplerian gaseous accretion disks , i.e. gaseous disks in near rotational equilibrium . in the absence of any accretion ( i.e. infall ) ,",
    "the equilibrium ( basic state ) rotation law of such a disk is governed by the radial component of the euler equation ,    [ eq : omega ] r ^2 = r _",
    "the assumption of near keplerianity means that radial pressure gradients are small compared to the two other terms in the above equation : @xmath24 .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that the disk geometrical thickness be small compared to its radius ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "a further consequence of this assumption is that , absent any variations of the density or temperature over a lengthscale comparable to the disk pressure scale height , @xmath26 , the epicyclic frequency , @xmath27 , is close to the keplerian value as well . in",
    "what follows , we will neglect any such deviation of @xmath27 from local keplerianity .",
    "since our basic state disk configuration is , by assumption , non - accreting , it would seem natural to assume that any radial stratification ( that would in general arise from accretion and associated dissipation ) is absent .",
    "it is possible , however , to imagine situations in which a non - accreting gaseous disk still possesses a non - zero radial stratification , as could be the case for instance in the presence of external sources of irradiation . for this reason",
    ", we generalize our discussion to the cases with : ( i ) no radial stratification ( @xmath28 ) , ( ii ) a stabilizing radial stratification ( @xmath29 ) and ( iii ) a destabilizing radial stratification ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the values @xmath31 are intentionally chosen to be large ( for a thin disk ) , to better illustrate the effects of finite @xmath32 values on stability . reducing these values to more realistic levels would not affect the results qualitatively , but it would make the identification of the effects on figures more difficult .",
    "while the formalism described in the previous section has been developed for magnetized disks , the hydrodynamical limit can be recovered by enforcing @xmath33 . the dispersion relation reduces to second order and the growth rate of unstable modes becomes independent of wavenumber ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath34 .",
    "one recognizes one of the classical solberg - hiland criteria for axisymmetric stability ( e.g. tassoul 1978 ) emerging from this expression for @xmath35 . around a black hole ,",
    "the keplerian rotation law becomes unstable inside of the classical marginally - stable orbit , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ( for all wavenumbers @xmath14 ) . while this is an exact result for a test particle ( or a dust disk ) ,",
    "hydrodynamical disks behave somewhat differently .",
    "first , the value of the disk epicyclic frequency , @xmath27 , is slightly modified by the presence a finite radial pressure gradient ( eq .  [ [ eq : omega ] ] ) , a small effect that we have chosen to ignore for simplicity .",
    "second , the presence of radial stratification modifies the radius of marginal stability ( i.e. the radius at which @xmath38 ) .",
    "marginal stability occurs at a radius somewhat larger ( smaller ) than the standard @xmath36 in the presence of a destabilizing ( stabilizing ) radial stratification .",
    "these modifications remain small for cold / thin disks ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "dimensionless reynolds stresses associated with linearly unstable hydrodynamical modes take the ( wavenumber independent ) form : @xmath40 . in the absence of radial stratification , @xmath41 , the dimensionless stress is everywhere positive within the radius of marginal stability and it vanishes exactly at that radius . when a finite radial stratification is present ,",
    "however , the degeneracy between the growth rate , @xmath13 , and the epicyclic frequency , @xmath27 , is broken , and @xmath42 diverges at marginal stability ( @xmath43 but @xmath44 ) .",
    "the divergence is positive for a stabilizing radial stratification and negative for a destabilizing one .",
    "therefore , in a disk with @xmath45 , there is a small region with negative stresses right inside of the radius of marginal stability .",
    "these results are graphically illustrated in figure  [ fig : three ] ( see below ) .",
    "the divergence of the dimensionless stress does not apply to the physically - relevant dimensional stress , however .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : one ] ) for linear perturbations shows that , in a hydrodynamical disk ( with @xmath46 ) , when @xmath47 while @xmath44 , @xmath48 must @xmath49 as well .",
    "[ this requirement disappears if @xmath50 at marginal stability ( i.e. absent any radial stratification ) , but there is no divergence of @xmath42 in that case because @xmath48 can remain finite ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] ) . ] the fact that @xmath51 at marginal stability is precisely what makes the dimensionless stress , @xmath42 , diverge ( if @xmath52 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dimensional stress , @xmath53 , vanishes exactly at marginal stability , where @xmath54 .",
    "all this guarantees that the physically relevant linear stress always vanishes at marginal stability , whether there is radial stratification or not .",
    "note that a similar situation occurs at marginal stability ( @xmath55 ) in a magnetized disk , as equation  ( [ eq : two ] ) for linear perturbations shows .",
    "despite the possibility of divergence at marginal stability , we found that using @xmath42 remained very useful because of its dimensionless nature .",
    ", which remains finite at marginal stability where the dimensional stress , @xmath56 , vanishes ( and @xmath42 diverges ) . ]      figure  [ fig : one ] shows growth rates of unstable modes , as a function of dimensionless wavenumber , @xmath57 , at four different locations in the vicinity of the classical marginally stable orbit , @xmath22 . only the case without radial stratification ( @xmath28 ) is shown because it was found that a value of @xmath58 only slightly reduces or increases growth rates in an approximately wavenumber independent way .",
    "for each of the curves in figure  [ fig : one ] , the mode with maximal growth is easily identified at @xmath59 .",
    "the growth rate of this most unstable mode increases as one approaches the black hole horizon because the shear and the epicyclic frequency become ever more destabilizing .",
    "values of the growth rate for the most unstable mode shown in figure  [ fig : one ] are found to be in very good agreement with corresponding fully general relativistic calculations for schwarzschild black holes ( araya - gochez 2002 ) .",
    "one observes a qualitative change in the behavior of small wavenumber ( large scale ) modes as a function of radius . at radii @xmath60 ( for @xmath28 and a strictly keplerian epicyclic frequency )",
    ", the growth rate of these modes tends to zero in the limit @xmath61 . within @xmath62",
    ", however , the growth rate tends to a finite value , which is @xmath63 .",
    "this is exactly the growth rate of unstable modes in a hydrodynamical disk at the same location within the radius of marginal stability .",
    "therefore , large scale modes characterized by weak magnetic tension ( small @xmath64 ) behave asymptotically like their hydrodynamical counterparts .",
    "note that this is the only physical significance attached to the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability in a magnetized disk . because there always are unstable modes , on scales small enough for magnetic tension to be important",
    ", there is no effective radius of marginal stability in a magnetized disk .",
    "finite radial stratification or pressure effects can modify somewhat the exact radius at which small wavenumber modes become unstable ( from the canonical @xmath62 value ; see discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] below ) , but they do not qualitatively alter the stability or stress properties .    figure  [ fig : two ] shows the total ( reynolds + maxwell ) dimensionless stresses , @xmath42 , associated with linearly unstable modes , as a function of the dimensionless wavenumber , @xmath65 , at the same four locations in the vicinity of the classical marginally stable orbit ( same notation and @xmath28 assumption as in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) . to illustrate the vanishing of the dimensional stress at marginal stability",
    ", we have multiplied the dimensionless stress by @xmath66 ( in this figure only ) , since we know that @xmath55 at marginal stability ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "again , a qualitative change in the stress across the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability occurs only for large scale modes .",
    "the stress is asymptotically zero outside of @xmath67 and asymptotically finite inside of @xmath62 , in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] summarizes the picture that emerges for linear perturbation stresses in magnetized and hydrodynamical disks in the region around the classical marginally stable orbit .",
    "the stress for the fastest growing mode in a magnetized disk is positive and continuous throughout the region of interest .",
    "the introduction of a stabilizing or destabilizing radial stratification does not qualitatively change this result . on the contrary ,",
    "the ( wavenumber independent ) linear perturbation stress in a hydrodynamical disk is positive only within the radius of marginal stability , whose location is affected by the introduction of radial stratification ( see lower short- and long - dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : three ] ) . at marginal stability ,",
    "hydrodynamical stresses vanish ( the apparent singularities of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] do not apply to the dimensional stress , @xmath70 , as discussed in  3.1 ) . the dotted line in figure  [ fig : three ] shows the linear perturbation stress for a representative `` hydro - like '' mode in a magnetized disk , i.e. a mode with @xmath71 which is subject only to weak magnetic tension . even for this `` hydro - like '' mode ,",
    "whose properties become very similar to those of purely hydrodynamical modes as @xmath72 , the linear perturbation stress remains strictly positive and continuous throughout the region of interest ( as does the growth rate ; see fig .  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "while it is not the main focus of this paper , it is worth emphasizing here what can be learned from the stable branch of the dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : ds ] ] ) . indeed , following early investigations by kato & fukue ( 1980 ) and okasaki , kato & fukue ( 1987 ) ,",
    "it has been suggested that global hydrodynamical modes in unmagnetized accretion disks could be trapped in the vicinity of black holes ( novak & wagoner 1991 ; 1992 ; 1993 ; perez et al .",
    "1997 ; kato 1990 ; 1993 ; 2002 ; 2003 ; li , goodman & narayan 2003 ) . mode trapping in this context relies on a purely relativistic effect : the epicyclic frequency reaches a maximum , before vanishing at the classical marginally - stable orbit , as one goes deeper and deeper into the black hole potential well ( or that of a very compact neutron star for that matter ; see , e.g. , wagoner 1999 for a review ) .",
    "one of main motivations for elucidating the properties of such diskoseismic modes is that they may be at the origin of a variety of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in compact accreting systems ( see , e.g. , van der klis 2000 for a review on qpo observations ) .",
    "given the restricted geometry considered , as well as the local and axisymmetric nature of the analysis , our dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : ds ] ] ) describes only a very small subset of all diskoseismic modes discussed in the literature and global trapped modes can not be studied explicitly .",
    "nonetheless , the dispersion relation is interesting because it does describe , in the magnetized context , inertio - gravity waves which are often regarded as the most observationally relevant diskoseismic mode ( wagoner 1999 ) .    figure  [ fig : four]a shows the frequency , @xmath73 , of wave solutions to our dispersion relation , as a function of the dimensionless wavenumber , @xmath57 .",
    "hydrodynamical analogues to these waves can be identified by taking the limit @xmath61 . outside of the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability , we find that the asymptotic value of the wave frequency is @xmath74 when @xmath68 . clearly , these waves correspond to the ( incompressible ) inertio - gravity waves of hydrodynamical theory .",
    "finite ) , the analogues of hydrodynamical diskoseismic waves with @xmath75 ( absent any radial stratification ) are not described by our dispersion relation .",
    "] as expected , the effect of introducing a finite radial stratification ( not shown here ) is to increase or decrease the wave frequency relative to the epicyclic frequency , @xmath27 ( in addition to changing the location of marginal stability ) .",
    "however , it is obvious from figure  [ fig : four ] that the behavior of these waves is very different in the large-@xmath64 limit , i.e. when magnetic tension becomes important .",
    "since we are working in the boussinesq approximation , fast magnetosonic waves are effectively filtered out from the dispersion relation .",
    "we also know that unstable modes in differentially - rotating disks are related to the slow mhd mode , so the waves described by figure  [ fig : four ] must correspond to the last of the three classes of mhd waves , namely alfvn waves ( as expected from the larger frequencies of these waves relative to the frequencies of slow mhd waves  described by the other branch of our dispersion relation  in the limit @xmath76 ; see balbus & hawley 1998 for a discussion of mhd waves in the accretion disk context ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : four]b illustrates two interesting properties of inertio - gravity - alfvn waves and  [ fig : four ] or , equivalently , by comparing the two ( stable and unstable ) branches of the dispersion relation in the limit @xmath68 , both inside and outside of the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability . ] in the vicinity of the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability .",
    "while inertio - gravity waves become purely evanescent within @xmath1 in unmagnetized disks , the corresponding waves in a magnetized disk continue to exist within @xmath1 , albeit with very low frequencies ( they become evanescent only asymptotically , i.e. in the limit @xmath68 ) .",
    "even if these waves do not become strictly evanescent ( @xmath77 ) inside of @xmath1 , the long - wavelength behavior they exhibit is broadly consistent with the hydrodynamical limit in the sense that there is a maximum and a decrease of the wave frequency as one approaches @xmath1 .",
    "note that , contrary to the purely hydrodynamical case , the location of the frequency maximum is not fixed at @xmath78 in magnetized disks but it becomes a function of wavenumber .",
    "waves with different wavenumbers would then be trapped in different regions of the disk .",
    "all this suggests that some of the results on trapped inertio - gravity waves in hydrodynamical disks ( due to the presence of a maximum of the epicyclic frequency , @xmath27 ) may remain valid in magnetized disks , provided one is allowed to consider long enough wavelengths for @xmath57 to be @xmath79 ( a condition which depends on the magnetic field strength explicitly ) . on the other hand , when magnetic tension becomes important ( i.e. if @xmath57 is not small ) , inertio - gravity - alfvn waves behave much more like alfvn waves .",
    "figure  [ fig : four]b shows that , in that regime , there is no significant change in the wave properties as one crosses the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability .",
    "the frequency maximum disappears and , as a result , mode trapping is no longer expected .",
    "our short digression on inertio - gravity - alfvn waves indicates that a more general treatment of waves in magnetized disks is much needed to address the issue of global mode trapping ( including compressibility effects allowing the existence of fast magnetosonic waves ) .",
    "our simple analysis suggests that results established in the hydrodynamical limit do not carry over automatically to magnetized disks , especially when magnetic tension becomes important .",
    "another difficulty that becomes apparent when studying magnetized disks is that all the waves coexist with the unstable slow mhd ( magneto - rotational ) mode , so that ignoring the resulting turbulence in the treatment of the background disk may be a serious oversimplification .",
    "the classical description of thin accretion disks around black holes involves the action of an `` anomalous viscosity '' far from the hole , which ( slowly ) brings gas down to the marginally stable orbit , @xmath80 . at that point ,",
    "particle orbits become unstable and the gas is expected to flow into the hole on essentially free - fall orbits .",
    "this rapid infall , whose origin is the dynamical instability at @xmath80 , must then cause the ( steady - state ) gas density within @xmath80 to be very small , so that fluid stresses should essentially vanish .",
    "another reason why one expects stresses to disappear somewhere outside of the black hole event horizon is that the infall speed must reach the speed of light at the horizon according to general relativity and therefore the flow must lose dynamical contact with external regions once it crosses the sonic ( or fast - magnetosonic ) surface .",
    "several elements of the classical picture should be revised now that we have a deeper understanding of the process responsible for accretion in the disk ( i.e. the `` anomalous viscosity '' of the classical theory ) .",
    "indeed , the magneto - rotational instability is a dynamical instability itself .",
    "it relies on a rotational imbalance that is also what fundamentally leads to free - fall within the marginally stable orbit according to classical theory . clearly , the fact that magnetized keplerian accretion disks are subject to the same dynamical , magneto - rotational instability far away from the black hole and within the classical marginally stable orbit , and the realization that this instability is responsible for accretion far from the hole in the first place , suggest that the classical marginal stability theory may be inadequate to describe magnetized accretion disks .",
    "the linear calculations presented in this paper are an attempt to formulate these objections in a more rigorous way .",
    "there is no doubt that the classical stability theory is exact for test particles ( or dust disks ) .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations show , however , that positive linear perturbation stresses resulting from rotational imbalance ( rayleigh instability ) in a nearly - keplerian gaseous accretion disk are possible within ( and only within ) the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability .",
    "this result is at odds with the classical description which postulates that the `` anomalous viscosity '' operates in the disk outside of @xmath1 but not inside of @xmath1 .",
    "even the hydrodynamical analysis may have little to do with astrophysical systems , however , since those are expected to contain magnetized disks .",
    "once a magnetic field is introduced , black hole accretion disks become dynamically unstable to the same magneto - rotational modes everywhere .",
    "disks are more unstable within the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability because of the increasing shear and ever more destabilizing epicyclic frequency , but there appears to be no reason ( at least in linear theory ) why one should invoke a sharp transition at or about the classical marginally stable orbit , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : three ] .",
    "it is interesting that this conclusion is independent of the disk geometrical thickness .",
    "indeed , the only requirement for our analysis to be valid ( within ideal mhd ) is that the magnetic field be weak enough for the wavelength of at least one unstable mode to fit within the disk scaleheigth .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to the requirement of a subthermal magnetic field ( @xmath81 ; see , e.g. , balbus & hawley 1998 ) . in our analysis",
    ", one is therefore free to chose the disk sound speed ( or equivalently disk thickness ) as small as desired , as long as it remains finite .",
    "the results remain unchanged , provided the basic state magnetic field in the disk is made weak enough to allow for the presence of unstable modes .",
    "there have been arguments presented in the literature for and against the classical picture , and in particular related to the issue of vanishing stresses within @xmath1 ( zero - torque boundary condition ) .",
    "krolik ( 1999 ; see also agol & krolik 2000 ) and gammie ( 1999 ) have argued that stresses could remain large across @xmath80 in a magnetized disk , while paczynski ( 2000 ) and afshordi & paczynski ( 2003 ) have argued in favor of the ( near-)vanishing of stresses at radii @xmath82 , provided the disk is geometrically thin ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "qualitatively , our linear analysis indicates that stresses should not vanish exactly anywhere around @xmath1 in a thin , magnetized disk , and in that sense it supports the claims of krolik ( 1999 ) and gammie ( 1999 ) . as a corollary",
    ", it suggests that the classical @xmath1 location loses much of its significance in magnetized disks .",
    "however , to the extent that the zero - torque issue is a quantitative one ( i.e. large vs. small stresses inside of @xmath80 ) , it is unclear whether linear stability theory can provide a useful answer .",
    "one should also be aware of important differences between our approach and the methods of previous authors .",
    "while these authors focused on steady - state models ( and some of their conclusions rely on that property ) , our stability analysis is intrinsically time - dependent ( a characteristic which may be viewed as a plus ) .",
    "on the other hand , we do not solve the global near - black - hole accretion problem , and in doing so , we neglect the important role of large infall velocities near the black hole event horizon ( @xmath83 ) which determine the location where dynamical contact is lost ( at the `` sonic '' surface ) and where stresses should vanish .",
    "another interesting property of our linear analysis is that it is local .",
    "the role of a large - scale magnetic field has at times been invoked to couple regions of the flow within @xmath1 to regions more distant from the black hole and thus justify the idea that stresses may not disappear inside of @xmath1 in magnetized disks ( see , e.g. , krolik 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) . our analysis , because it is local in nature , shows that such a large - scale `` radially - connecting '' magnetic field is not required for stresses to remain finite across the hydrodynamical radius of marginal stability .",
    "clearly , there are a number of elements of the near - black - hole accretion problem that the linear analysis can not capture .",
    "most importantly , it is the global mhd turbulence resulting from the non - linear development of the magneto - rotational instability that is ultimately relevant for the observational properties of accreting black holes ( see krolik & hawley 2002 for a discussion of the issues in that regime ) .",
    "it is also significant that , while magnetized turbulent accretion disks have been shown to remain relatively close to rotational equilibrium ( i.e. keplerian ) at large distances from the black hole ( see , e.g. , hawley , balbus & stone 2001 ) , numerical simulations show ( and the infall constraint @xmath84 guarantees ) that accretion must be far from rotational equilibrium in the vicinity of the black hole event horizon ( see , e.g. , hawley & krolik 2001 ; 2002 ) .",
    "this is an indication that linear perturbation results based on a nearly - keplerian basic state must be interpreted with caution in that region .",
    "one should also keep in mind that our analysis was carried out for strictly axisymmetric perturbations and that non - axisymmetric perturbations may , in general , have different stability and transport properties .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that there is no reason for stresses to vanish in the vicinity of the classical marginally - stable orbit , irrespective of the geometrical thickness of thin accretion disks and whether large - scale `` radially - connecting '' magnetic fields are present or not .",

    "<S> when a magnetic field is introduced , however , the concept of radius of marginal stability becomes largely irrelevant because there are linearly unstable magneto - rotational modes everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> associated linear stresses are positive and continuous across the region of hydrodynamical marginal stability , even for large - scale `` hydro - like '' modes subject only to weak magnetic tension . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is valid for arbitrarily thin disks ( in ideal mhd ) and it does not require a large - scale `` radially - connecting '' magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> results on hydrodynamical diskoseismic modes trapped in deep relativistic potential wells should be revised to account for the short - wavelength alfvn - like behavior of inertio - gravity waves in magnetized disks .    # </S>",
