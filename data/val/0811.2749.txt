    "observationally detected stellar pulsation frequencies can be used to place constraints on stellar models , giving us an improved understanding of the interior structure and evolution of stars .",
    "the most successful application has been the sun , where the large number of observed modes have placed strict constraints on parameters such as the helium abundance ( y ) @xcite , the depth of the convection zone @xcite , and the interior angular momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "observations of pulsation frequencies of other stars continue to improve , particularly through dedicated satellites such as wire @xcite , most @xcite , corot @xcite and kepler @xcite as well as ground - based networks such as stephi @xcite and wet @xcite . these improved observations , giving us long term coverage and improved accuracy , are the first steps in enabling other stars to be constrained in a similar manner to the sun .",
    "asteroseismology then , has the potential to answer a number of questions about the interior structure of stars throughout the hr diagram .",
    "one aspect of stellar structure which could be explored using asteroseismology is the internal rotation rate .",
    "it is theoretically possible for stars to rotate with angular velocity increasing or decreasing with distance from the rotation axis , and there is some evidence that the latter may be true in massive main sequence stars , at least at the surface @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is uniform rotation .",
    "it has been argued that uniform rotation is unrealistic based on observations of the praesepe and hyades clusters @xcite . of course , other , less well structured rotation laws are possible . however , there is little evidence in support of a specific rotation law , and the large uncertainties prevent any of the possibilities from being ruled out .",
    "we note in passing that the solar rotation rate in the convection zone is primarily dependent on latitude @xcite and thus can not be described by a conservative rotation law .",
    "recently , interferometric observations of achernar @xcite found that this star is far more oblate than is possible for a uniformly rotating star .",
    "this is true because uniformly rotating stars reach critical rotation before they have sufficient angular momentum to produce such an oblate object .",
    "however , @xcite noted that models in which the rotation rate increases inward from the surface can produce the oblateness observed for achernar and still match the observed @xmath1sin@xmath2 .",
    "while further study has proposed that the oblateness may be due to a circumstellar envelope @xcite , the original conclusion does raise the interesting question as to whether stars with rotation laws required to produce such an oblate shape exist , and if so , whether these rotation laws could be identified by possible pulsation modes .",
    "we investigate this possibility in this paper .",
    "differential rotation with the rotation rate increasing inwards , as is considered in this paper , will have an impact on the deep interior structure of the star , provided the differential rotation is large enough .",
    "rapid rotation in the outer layers of a star has little to no effect on the gravitational potential and core structure , as the envelope contains a relatively small fraction of the stellar mass .",
    "in fact , many early attempts to model rotating stars assumed that the mass in the envelope was negligible and that the gravitational potential in this region could be modelled using a roche potential @xcite .",
    "however , it was recognized early on that this assumption was not always valid .",
    "efforts to model a wider variety of rotating stars were made through the implementation of the self - consistent field ( scf ) method @xcite , or through direct , 2d finite difference solutions to poisson s equation @xcite .",
    "these methods allowed stars to be modelled with differential rotation , at least under certain circumstances .",
    "concentrating angular momentum in the center , unlike uniform rotation , can produce enough distortion to affect the core , and consequently the evolution of the star . only in this case",
    "can we produce a model with interior properties significantly different from the uniformly rotating model @xcite .",
    "even restricting ourselves to this type of differential rotation does not narrow the possibilities significantly",
    ". the rotation could be shellular , as proposed by @xcite , or cylindrical ( conservative rotation laws ) . in this paper , we have focused on conservative rotation laws , either with uniform rotation or with the rotation rate increasing towards the center of the star",
    ". further discussion of our models can be found in  [ models ] . in  [ relfreq ] we consider the eigenfrequencies of rotating models as well as the large and small separations in  [ large ] and  [ small ] respectively .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the stellar models are computed using the 2d stellar structure code rotorc @xcite .",
    "the code uses the opal opacities @xcite and equation of state @xcite . here",
    "we consider only 10 m@xmath0  zams models with x=0.7 , z=0.02 .",
    "these models solve the conservation equations of mass , momentum , energy , and hydrogen abundance along with poisson s equation for the gravitational potential on a two dimensional finite difference grid with the fractional surface equatorial radius and the colatitude as the independent variables .",
    "the surface equatorial radius is determined by requiring that the integral of the density over the volume of the model equals the stellar mass .",
    "the zams models are taken to be time independent and static , except for the imposed rotation law , so that the mass , azimuthal momentum , and hydrogen composition conservation equations drop out .",
    "the only change required in the stellar evolution code for nonuniform cylindrical rotation laws is the addition of an extra term in the total potential ( e.g. , tassoul 2000 ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rotation velocity ( in radians per second ) and @xmath5 is the distance from the rotation axis ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fractional surface equatorial radius and @xmath8 is the colatitude ) . the extra term is the last term on the right hand side of the equation .",
    "performing the integral is straightforward for an analytically imposed rotation rate distribution in the zams models .",
    "the total potential is used only to determine the surface location at each latitude by taking the surface to be an equipotential .",
    "although defining a total potential requires a conservative rotation law , this is the only way in which a conservative rotation law is utilized in the stellar structure code .",
    "we have constructed uniformly rotating zams models with rotation velocities between 0 and 360 km s@xmath9 , with an approximate spacing of 30 km s@xmath9 .",
    "we have also computed a number of differentially rotating models at two values of the surface equatorial rotation velocity , 120 and 240 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the differential rotation law is as given by @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parameter ranging from 0 ( uniform rotation ) to 2 , the maximum allowed for stability .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are used to impose the desired surface equatorial velocity and shape of the rotation law at small distances from the rotation axis .",
    "we have arbitrarily chosen @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : omega ] shows the rotation rate as a function of distance perpendicular to the rotation axis for a surface equatorial rotation velocity of 120 km s@xmath9  and a surface equatorial radius for a uniformly rotating model at that speed . increasing @xmath11 increases the rotation rate close to the the rotation axis , including in the core of the star .",
    "increasing angular momentum increases structural changes , and thus the structural changes increase with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "it is expected that increasing the rotation rate through increasing @xmath11 may in some ways mimic more rapid uniform rotation .",
    "one major result produced by significant rotation is an appreciable distortion of the surface of the model .",
    "we present the surface shape for a set of uniformly rotating models with surface equatorial velocities ranging from 0 to 360 km s@xmath9  in figure [ fig : shapeuniform ] . for each model the equatorial radius is taken to be unity .",
    "the ratio between the polar and equatorial radius decreases with increasing rotation , as the polar radius decreases slightly while the equatorial radius increases considerably .",
    "differential rotation in which the rotation rate increases with decreasing distance from the rotation axis amplifies this effect .",
    "we present the surface shape for the differentially rotating models in figure [ fig : shapediff ] .",
    "the solid curves are for a surface equatorial velocity of 120 km s@xmath9 , while the dashed curves denote a surface equatorial velocity of 240 km s@xmath9 . as the parameter @xmath11 in equation [ eqn : omega ] increases , the fractional polar radius decreases .",
    "the change in fractional radius with @xmath11 is greatest at the pole and decreases towards the equator .",
    "note that the fractional polar radius for a model rotating with a surface equatorial velocity of 120 km s@xmath9  and a value of @xmath11 of 1.8 has nearly the same fractional polar radius as a model uniformly rotating at 240 km s@xmath9 .",
    "we have increased the radial resolution of the static models by more than a factor of two over that used by lovekin and deupree ( 2008 ) .",
    "the intent is to reduce the scatter and uncertainty in the pulsation mode calculations , particularly for the large and small separations . by and large",
    "this has been successful .",
    "the determination of the pulsational properties of these models is made using the linear adiabatic pulsation code developed by @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to input models with conservative rotation laws so that we can write the effective gravity ( @xmath15 ) as the derivative of the total potential .",
    "the input models are axisymmetric spheroids , which allows us to assume a @xmath16}$ ] time and azimuthal dependence .",
    "the equations to be linearized are the three components of the momentum conservation equation , the mass conservation equation , the adiabatic relation between the density ( @xmath17 ) and the pressure ( p ) , and poisson s equation .",
    "the dependent variables are the three components of the linearized displacements ( @xmath18 ) , the linearized eulerian displacements of the density ( @xmath19 ) pressure ( @xmath20 ) , and the gravitational potential ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we start with the perturbed momentum equation : @xmath22\\vec{v}\\right ) = \\triangledown(\\delta\\phi)+\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\rho}{\\rho^2}\\right)\\triangledown p - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\triangledown\\delta p\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the velocity , which includes both the pulsational perturbations and the velocity distribution of the unperturbed model here we assume this later velocity results exclusively from rotation , and is given by @xmath24 here @xmath4 is the rotation rate , and our assumption of a conservative rotation law requires it to be a function only of the distance from the rotation axis , @xmath25 .",
    "we can write an expression for the eulerian perturbation of the velocity in terms of the displacements because the lagrangian time derivative of the displacement is the lagrangian velocity perturbation .",
    "thus , @xmath26 substituting this expression into the above perturbed momentum equation and proceeding along the same lines as @xcite leads to the following expression for the three individual components of the momentum equation : @xmath27-\\frac{\\partial\\delta p}{\\partial r } = -ag_r(\\triangledown\\cdot\\vec{\\xi})\\ ] ] @xmath28-\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\delta p}{\\partial \\theta } = -ag_{\\theta}(\\triangledown\\cdot\\vec{\\xi})\\ ] ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "the other equations required are as listed in @xcite : mass conservation , the adiabatic relationship between the density and pressure perturbations , and poisson s equation for the perturbed gravitational potential : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    differential rotation has introduced two new terms into each of the radial and latitudinal momentum equations .",
    "the other change is that @xmath38 , the eigenfrequency in the local rotating frame , is no longer constant except for axisymmetric modes .",
    "this does not alter the solution algorithm , however , because clement s ( 1998 ) approach was to select @xmath38 ( which now becomes selecting @xmath39 and calculating @xmath38 locally as needed ) , solve all the equations and see if a discriminant was satisfied .",
    "neither the added terms nor the nature of the eigenvalue requires any further modification to the approach , and the derivation of the final equations proceeds as described by @xcite .    using these equations we can calculate the pulsation properties of the stellar models on a 2d finite difference grid . this is done through a change of variables , factoring out the behavior of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath21 near the boundaries to eliminate singularities .",
    "the coefficients of these equations can be put in a band - diagonal matrix and solved .",
    "nro can include up to nine angular zones in the eigenfunction solution .",
    "this gives the solution at n angles , where n is the number of angular zones , which can subsequently be decomposed into the contributions of individual spherical harmonics through the use of fourier transforms . throughout this paper , we have used n = 6 .",
    "based on the calculations of @xcite , six spherical harmonics is sufficient to accurately calculate the eigenfrequencies for the most rapidly rotating models discussed here .",
    "indeed , we have performed a few test calculations with n = 8 and have found that the effect on the frequencies is small , typically a few hundredths of a percent .    as discussed in @xcite , nro , combined with stellar structure models from rotorc , allows us to calculate the pulsation frequencies for rotating stars without making any _ a priori _ assumptions about the structure , except that the rotation law is conservative for nro . for further discussion of the method of solution used by nro , refer to @xcite or @xcite .    with spherical stellar models , the radial and angular components of the perturbations separate , and the angular part",
    "can be expressed as a spherical harmonic with specific values of the quantum numbers , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    for rotating stars , the eigenfunction solution is not a single spherical harmonic , and @xmath43 is not a valid quantum number .",
    "indeed , nro uses @xmath43 only to specify the parity of the mode being calculated , and includes the first @xmath45 even or odd spherical harmonics , where @xmath45 is the number of angles included .",
    "we identify modes using a quantum number @xmath46 , which is the @xmath43 of the mode in the non - rotating model to which a given mode can be traced . for spheroids , @xmath44 remains a valid quantum number . as in @xcite ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to axisymmetric modes ( @xmath47 ) and modes with small radial quantum number ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "in this paper we consider low order axisymmetric modes for @xmath46 = 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "these modes are expected to have the highest amplitudes and the smallest cancellation effects across the visible surface of the star , and are hence expected to be the most easily visible .",
    "our structural models cover velocities from 0 to 360 km s@xmath9  and for two velocities , 120 and 240 km s@xmath9 , we have calculated differentially rotating models with @xmath11 varying from 0 to 2.0 .",
    "tracing the individual modes becomes very difficult above rotation velocities of 360 km s@xmath9  and for some higher values of @xmath11 , and this represents a practical limit to our study .",
    "although the frequencies can be calculated at these velocities , the resulting eigenfunctions are a mix of six spherical harmonics , and no single harmonic dominates . as it is very difficult to reliably assign a value of @xmath46 to these modes ,",
    "we exclude them from our analysis .",
    "it is probably feasible to trace the modes accurately , but this could require an extremely fine rotational velocity grid ( 1 - 5 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "we decided not to pursue this for this exploratory work . for differentially rotating models , the limits are @xmath11 = 1.8 for the 120 km",
    "s@xmath9  model and @xmath11 = 1.0 for the 240 km s@xmath9  model . based on the curves shown in figure [ fig : omega ]",
    ", it appears that the limit is related to the angular velocity near the rotation axis .",
    "the curve representing @xmath11 = 1.0 has approximately half the value at the center of the @xmath11 = 2.0 curve .",
    "therefore , if we double the velocities everywhere , the limiting @xmath11 should move from 1.8 at 120 km s@xmath9  to 1.0 at 240 km s@xmath9 , which corresponds to approximately the same angular velocity near the rotation axis .",
    "the trends produced by tracing a given mode through increases in rotation velocity are illustrated in figure [ fig : l0 ] for the @xmath46 = 2 mode , which shows the eigenfrequencies normalized by the non - rotating frequency for each mode .",
    "overall , the trends we find for frequency agree with those calculated by previous work @xcite .",
    "these authors find that the frequencies decrease as one increases the rotation rate , with higher frequency modes decreasing more than lower modes .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , our results at low to moderate rotation rates are also consistent with the frequency trends predicted by second order perturbation theory ( see for example , saio 1981 ) .",
    "we have increased the radial resolution of the outer 30% of the radius of the static models by more than a factor of two over that used by @xcite .",
    "this produces a radial zoning finer than that currently allowed by the pulsation code , so further increases in radial resolution in the 2d structure models will only be effective if the pulsation code is modified to allow more radial zones .",
    "the intent of the modified zoning is to reduce the scatter and uncertainty in the mode calculations evident in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : l0 ] shows that a reasonable estimate of our accuracy for the frequencies is a very few tenths of a percent , although there are still a few frequencies , most commonly but not exclusively for the higher radial orders and higher rotation rates , which do not fit within this limit .",
    "one might expect the radial resolution near the rotation axis and at mid latitudes to be less than for lower rotation rates because the fractional radius at these latitudes compared to the equator is lower .",
    "the accuracy of the small separation appears well within a @xmath49hz , while the large separation does show variations on the order of one @xmath49hz , particularly at higher rotation velocities and for higher radial order modes .",
    "this is compatible with the notion that the radial resolution near the surface could continue to benefit from refinement .",
    "however , these uncertainties do not disguise trends in the results , even in the large separation , with respect to rotation rate or the rotation law , and we consider these trends significant .    one interesting line of inquiry is whether there is some analog to the period - mean density relation which allows interpolation of eigenfrequencies as functions of models and rotation rates .",
    "specifically , we have examined if there is a physically meaningful radius which can be used in the period - mean density relation @xmath50 ( where m and r are in solar units , and p is the period ) that would allow q to be approximately constant as a function of the rotation rate .",
    "the comparatively small changes in the eigenfrequencies shown in figure [ fig : l0 ] suggest that the surface equatorial radius , with its fairly rapid increase as a function of rotation , will not keep q approximately constant , and it does not .",
    "the same is true for an average radius , defined as either a straight average or the effective radius required to contain the total volume of the model",
    ". the polar radius would be more promising because it only slowly varies with the rotation rate , but it actually decreases slightly as the rotation rate increases .",
    "this is the wrong direction to keep q constant because the frequency decreases as well .",
    "because the polar radius decreases slightly and the equatorial radius increases appreciably with increasing rotation , one might guess there would be some latitude at which the radius increases at a rate that nearly offsets the rate of period increase .",
    "this is true , and occurs at a colatitude of 40 degrees .",
    "it is not obvious that this has any physical significance because it is difficult to associate any specific meaning to the radius at this latitude .",
    "we present the pulsation constant for two definitions of an effective radius in figure [ fig : q ] .",
    "one way is to use the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the model .",
    "the other uses the radius at a colatitude of 40@xmath51 . for comparison",
    "we show a `` pulsation constant '' that would exist if we used the mean density of the nonrotating model .",
    "we include this to give an idea of the size of the effect .",
    "interestingly , the variation in the pulsation constant is significantly larger allowing the mean density to be determined by the total volume of the rotating model ( the mass is the same for all models ) than it is when the mean density is assumed to be that of the nonrotating model .",
    "the frequencies can also be changed by the mass or evolutionary state of the star , producing trends that could potentially be confused with rotational effects .",
    "we wish to determine how closely the frequencies of a rotating model can be mimicked by a non - rotating model .",
    "first we calculated the q values for each model in the 10 and 12 m@xmath0  non - rotating models . for each mode , we then took the mean of the q of the two models .",
    "we used this average q for the radial fundamental mode and the frequency of the radial fundamental mode for the model rotating at 150 km s@xmath9  to calculate a mean density .",
    "this corresponds to the mean density of a non - rotating model of unknown mass and radius pulsating in the radial fundamental mode with the same frequency as the 10 m@xmath0  model rotating at 150 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the mean density found this way and the average q s for the other @xmath46 s can be used to predict the other frequencies of this presumed non - rotating model . when these frequencies are compared to the calculated frequencies for the rotating model , the differences are significant .",
    "using q to calculate the frequencies in this way forces the radial fundamental mode to have the same frequency , so the differences between frequencies should be solely a result of rotation .",
    "the frequencies predicted for the @xmath46 = 0 and 2 modes are larger by 1 - 5% , with the differences increasing for higher order modes . at the same time , the frequencies predicted for the @xmath46 = 1 and 3 modes are smaller , by as much as 15 % for the @xmath46 = 1 @xmath52 mode .",
    "as the radial order increases , the differences between the rotating model and the non - rotating calculation decreases for the @xmath46 = 1 modes , but increases for the @xmath46 = 3 modes .",
    "the size and direction of these trends implies that the pulsation spectrum of a rotating model is unlikely to be confused with the pulsation spectrum of a more massive non - rotating model .",
    "it also suggests that rotation must be included in the calculations if observations indicate it might be present even at this moderate amount .",
    "we have also evolved a single non - rotating model , and compared the zams model with one part way through the main sequence evolution ( x@xmath53 = 0.47 ) . in this case , the frequencies decreased sufficiently , even for a model with a large remaining core hydrogen fraction , that confusion seems unlikely .      we have studied the change in the frequencies of 10m@xmath0  zams models differentially rotating at 120 km s@xmath9  and 240 km s@xmath9 .",
    "overall , the frequencies increase for @xmath46 = 0 and 1 , and decrease for @xmath46 = 2 and 3 , a trend seen at both 120 km s@xmath9  and 240 km s@xmath9 .",
    "our results for @xmath46 = 0 are shown in figure [ fig:120fund ] for the fundamental , 1h , 2h and 3h modes for a model rotating at 120 km s@xmath9 . in this case , the frequency changes are largest for the 3h modes , but are noticeable for all modes by @xmath11 @xmath54 1 .",
    "similar trends are found for the other values of @xmath46 considered here .",
    "still , the differences remain relatively small , and it seems unlikely that even extreme differential rotation with this surface rotation velocity will be detectable using the values of the eigenfrequencies alone .    the frequency results for the 240 km s@xmath9model , shown in figure [ fig:240fund ] for @xmath46 = 0 , are slightly more promising . although we were unable to reliably identify modes above @xmath11 = 1.0 ,",
    "the frequencies already differ by more than 1% by @xmath11 = 1.0 for the 1h mode , and it seems the differences would be noticeable by @xmath11 = 0.4 .",
    "if this trend continues , as seems likely at least for the f and 1h modes , the frequency differences should be large enough to be detectable in these more rapidly rotating stars . as noted above",
    ", for some modes differential rotation causes the frequencies to increase as in figures [ fig:240fund ] and [ fig : l1_240 ] , while for others the frequencies decrease , as in figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "these plots do not include the 3h mode , as we found that the scatter in this mode remained a significant fraction of the variation , despite the improved radial zoning , and so have chosen not to include it in our discussion .",
    "the effects of differential rotation compared with uniform rotation are shown in figure [ fig : comp ] for the @xmath46 = 2 @xmath55 mode .",
    "differential rotation can change the frequencies by about a percent above and beyond the difference predicted based on surface equatorial velocity alone .",
    "the differences are small ; about 1% for the most extreme differentially rotating model at 120 km s@xmath9 . based on the frequencies we have calculated",
    ", it may be possible to discriminate between uniform and this type of differential rotation , given the right combination of properly identified frequencies .",
    "since frequencies increase relative to the uniformly rotating case for some @xmath46 , and decrease for others , these differences could be used to constrain the rotation .",
    "this would require a star with a few positively identified modes , some of which were either @xmath46 = 0 or 1 , and some of which were either @xmath46 = 2 or 3 .",
    "the number of modes required and the challenges presented by accurate mode identification in massive main sequence stars may make this extremely difficult in practice .",
    "if one considers two stellar models that are in the same evolutionary phase , and appear reasonably close to each other in the hr diagram , the frequencies can be approximately determined from the relevant pulsation constant , q. as the mass and radius change with position in the hr diagram , so will the frequencies .",
    "it is expected that for small changes in mass and radius the frequency differences ( either frequency separations or ratios ) will change , like q , much more slowly than the individual frequencies . as a result ,",
    "the large and small separations are probably more useful than individual frequencies as they are less sensitive to small changes in the models .",
    "the large separation , defined as @xmath56 can provide information about the outer layers of the stellar envelope .",
    "the large separation for the @xmath46 = 0 mode is shown as a function of the rotation rate in figure [ fig : largel0 ] .",
    "we note that the overall trend of the large separation for this mode is to decrease as the rotation rate increases . at other @xmath46",
    "the trend is the same and the large separation decreases for every pair of modes considered .",
    "the magnitude of the decrease in large separation does increase slightly with increasing @xmath46 , as can be seen by comparing figures [ fig : largel0 ] and [ fig : largel1 ] . for nonrotating zams models , both the frequencies and the large separations decrease as the mass ( hence the radius , luminosity and effective temperature ) increases .",
    "the decrease in the large separation occurs not only because the frequencies decrease , but also because the period ratios increase for increasing zams mass .",
    "however , for stars observed approximately equator on , rotation decreases the perceived luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "this offset between the perceived luminosity and temperature and the large separation may be useful as a rotation discriminant .",
    "of course , stars observed nearly pole on show an increase in perceived luminosity and effective temperature , which is in line with the decreasing large separation as the rotation rate increases .",
    "any discriminant of rotation may only be a matter of degree for low inclination objects .",
    "we noted in section [ sec : unifreq ] that the decrease in the frequencies with increasing rotation can not be explained purely by the decrease in the mean density ( i.e. , a constant q ) . the mean density decreases faster than the pulsation periods increase as the rotation rate increases .",
    "interestingly , the decrease in the large separation for @xmath46 = 0 in figure [ fig : largel0 ] is almost entirely offset by the mean density so that @xmath57 is nearly constant , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mean density does not offset the steeper decline in the large separation for the @xmath46 = 2 modes shown in figure [ fig : largel1 ] .",
    "the large separations provide information about the region near the surface of the star , while the frequencies provide information on more global properties . as discussed above , the separations are less sensitive to small changes in the mass or radius of the star , but since they probe the surface region , may provide information about changes in this region as a result of rotation .",
    "a comparison of figures [ fig : shapeuniform ] and [ fig : shapediff ] shows that the polar radius is significantly more affected by differential rotation than the radius at lower latitudes .",
    "this kind of effect may be detectable using the large separations .",
    "indeed , based on the results in the previous section , we expect there to be significant changes in the period differences , as we have found that differential rotation can sometimes introduce a significant shift in only one or two of the harmonics .",
    "although the individual frequencies can show significant relative differences , this does not carry over to the large separations . the large separation for the @xmath46 = 0 modes of a differentially rotating model with surface equatorial velocity of 120 km",
    "s@xmath9are shown in figure [ fig : large_120 ] .",
    "the large separations shown in this plot show very little change with increasing @xmath11 , much less than the differences shown in figure [ fig : largel0 ] . the same lack of variation is seen for all modes .",
    "given that the large separation probes the surface regions , this might be regarded as somewhat surprising because changing the @xmath11 does change the surface configuration , particularly near the rotation axis .    at 240 km s@xmath9 , the large separations , shown in figure [ fig : large_240 ]",
    ", are again quite constant over the region shown .",
    "most separations either remain constant or show a slight increase , at least to @xmath11 = 0.6 , at which point some of the higher order separations decrease slightly .",
    "again , this is different from the trend seen in the uniformly rotating models . particularly at high @xmath11 , the separations moving in different directions may allow constraints to be placed on observed stars .",
    "the differences begin to become noticeable at @xmath11 @xmath54 0.6 for most of the high order modes considered .",
    "however , for most modes the large separation never differs by more than a few @xmath49hz . as for the frequencies",
    ", it seems that the large separations are unlikely to produce any very refined constraints on the internal rotation rate , at least for this particular rotation law .",
    "asymptotic theory @xcite , which predicts that the large separation should be approximately constant as @xmath48 gets large , also predicts near degeneracy between modes with the same value of @xmath58 : @xmath59 the deviations from this degeneracy are defined as the small separation : @xmath60 where @xmath34 is the sound speed .",
    "the sound speed changes in the core are sufficiently large that the ( 1/r ) variation dominates the integral on the right hand side of equation [ eqn : small ] , and hence the small separation is dominated by the structure in the core .      at slow uniform rotation , the size and shape of the convective core is nearly unaltered by the rotation , and one would expect the effects on the small separation to be minimal .",
    "figure [ fig : small ] shows this to be true , but also shows that the small separation for higher @xmath48 increases markedly with the rotation rate once the rotation exceeds approximately 150 km s@xmath9 .",
    "there are slight changes to both the shape and relative size of the convective core with rotation , although the absolute mass and radius of the core change only slightly .",
    "it is not obvious why the small separation increases so markedly .",
    "this effect has also been noted by @xcite    small separations are frequently used as probes of the core structure of stars , and can be used to constrain overshooting and core composition @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that convective core overshooting causes a slight decrease in the small separations , with the effect becoming more pronounced as the star evolves .",
    "this slight trend is opposite to that produced by at least moderate rotation , which appreciably increases the small separation .",
    "clearly , this is a situation in which caution must be exercised when using observed modes to constrain conditions deep in the stellar interior .      for differentially rotating models",
    ", the overall trend is the same , with small separations increasing with increasing differential rotation .",
    "however , figures [ fig : small_120 ] and [ fig : small_240 ] show that the variation in small separation is much less than for uniformly rotating models .",
    "the trends are consistent with the relationship between the effects of @xmath11 and those of increasing the uniform rotation rate as shown in figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "the effects of increasing @xmath11 on the convective core mimic to some extent those of increasing the uniform rotation rate , although high values of @xmath11 do make the convective core more oblate .",
    "the different effects of @xmath11 on the large and small separations is understandable in that increasing @xmath11 increases the rotation and its effects near the rotation axis , and this certainly includes the convective core .",
    "however , this trend of increasing @xmath11 producing similar trends to increasing uniform rotation rate does not give us confidence that we have a useful tool for diagnosing a rotation law of the kind we have considered through the small separation .",
    "we have investigated the effects of uniform and differential rotation on pulsational eigenfrequencies . for uniformly rotating models",
    ", we have found that the frequencies decrease as the rotation rate increases for all values of @xmath46 and @xmath48 considered here , although the rate of decrease varies with the mode in question . while this frequency behavior is expected assuming the period - mean density relation applies , the frequency changes are much smaller than the period - mean density would suggest .",
    "we do find a pulsation constant being approximately constant if we use the surface radius at a colatitude of about 40@xmath51 in the period - mean density relation , although this radius does not represent the mean density .    for the differential rotation law considered here , we find the frequencies at a given velocity may either increase or decrease , depending on @xmath46 , with increasing differential rotation , relative to the uniformly rotating model . however , the overall effects in all cases are comparatively small , with maximum differences typically on the order of 1% when compared to the uniformly rotating case",
    ".    uniform rotation decreases the large separation by several @xmath49hz ( @xmath61 10 ) over the entire range of rotation ( 0 - 360 km s@xmath9 ) considered here .",
    "the large separation was virtually unchanged ( @xmath61 1 @xmath49hz ) from that of uniform rotation for the range of differential rotation parameters considered here , despite the noticeable change in the surface shape .",
    "although this change in shape is noticeable , it is still considerably smaller than the change produced by uniform rotation .",
    "both uniform and differential rotation increase the small separation .",
    "the small separation can change markedly over the range of uniform rotation considered , while the dependence of the small separation on the rotation profile is more modest but not inconsistent with the other effects produced when comparing uniform and differential rotation .",
    "the effects of rotation on the frequencies and separations are generally large enough that rotation must be considered in the asteroseismology of these upper main sequence stars .",
    "while the precise rotation rate at which one must be concerned with rotation depends on the level of accuracy achievable , it is certainly no larger than 100 km s@xmath9  for our 10 m@xmath0  zams models .",
    "although we have shown there can be significant differences in the pulsation properties of rotating stars , it is not clear that these results can actually be used to constrain the interior rotation rate . given the possible combinations of effects from the rotation rate and distribution , the mass of the star , convective overshoot , evolutionary stage , etc , it seems unlikely that pulsation properties will give a unique solution , particularly if the number of observed modes is modest or can not be properly identified .",
    "however , we have found that some combinations of modes constrain some of these properties .",
