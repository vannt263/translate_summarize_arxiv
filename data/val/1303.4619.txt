    "while mechanical reinforcement with single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) has been a hot topic since the 1990s @xcite , recently interest is also growing in individual - layer or few - layer based nanomaterials such as graphene , bn and mos@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "bulk mechanical properties are commonly specified using well defined parameters such as young s modulus @xmath1 ( see also [ formule_e ] and @xcite ) . when making the transition to nanoobjects this leads to complications , since the object boundaries and hence volume and cross - section have no general and transferable definition .",
    "thus while elastic tensors remain unambiguously defined at these scales , the conversion of both experimental and theoretical strains and forces into mechanical constants such as young s modulus require a definition of mechanically active volume . + to date no such generalised and transferable volume definition exists . a common approach is to use geometric  macroscopic \" volume models such as a rectangular slab for flat graphene or an empty cylinder for swcnts .",
    "however literature values chosen for the thickness @xmath2 of the graphene slab or swcnt cylinder range from @xmath3  @xcite , leading to wildly different volumes or cross - sections .",
    "the result is a wide scatter in reported values of the in - plane young s modulus for graphene and the axial young s modulus for swcnts , between @xmath4 tpa @xcite .",
    "currently the most common approach for graphene is to consider it as a uniform slab with thickness of the interlayer spacing of graphite ( 3.35   ) .",
    "when both theory and experiment adopt this same value , the result is reasonably matching values of the in - plane young s modulus between theory @xmath5 @xcite - @xmath6 tpa @xcite and experiment @xmath7 @xcite - @xmath8 tpa @xcite .",
    "simply transferring the graphite inter - layer distance to the cylinder thickness for swcnts provokes questions about the influence of curvature on the volume @xcite , especially for narrow nanotubes . to date",
    "all such geometric approaches have in common the lack of a conceptual framework required for its generalisation to other related structures .",
    "+ volume can alternatively be defined based on a sum of spherical overlapping atomic radii , such as covalent or van der waals radii @xcite .",
    "however by drawing on a library of pre - existing small molecules rather than considering the precise system in hand , such definitions once again suffer from a lack in transferability .",
    "notably @xmath9-bond systems are very poorly represented via van der waals radii @xcite .",
    "thus to date there is no general method to describe mechanically active nanoobject volume , capable of describing different kinds of structures without introducing various empirical or experimental parameters .",
    "+ in this article we present a new geometry independent , parameter free and transferable volume definition based on the electron density distribution in the material , accessible from general density functional ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we apply this to calculations of young s modulus and poisson s ratio of nanosheets and single - wall carbon nanotubes .",
