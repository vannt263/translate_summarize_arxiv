    "explaining the existence of hot jupiters  jupiter - mass planets on circular orbits with periods of only a few days  is one of the oldest problems in exoplanetary science .",
    "theoretical models suggested that while it is formally possible for core accretion to produce a giant planet at @xmath2 au around a sun - like star , it is more likely that they form beyond the location of the water - ice line in the protoplanetary disk at @xmath3 au and subsequently migrate into the close proximity of the host star @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms for this migration have been proposed . in disk - driven migration ,",
    "interactions between a planet and the protoplanetary disk move a giant planet from the water - ice line to the inner edge of the disk within the few myr of the disk s lifetime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in high - eccentricity migration ,",
    "a giant planet initially forms on a circular orbit near the water - ice line .",
    "the orbital eccentricity is then excited to @xmath4 in one of several possible ways : close encounters with other planets , secular interactions with another massive body in the system , or a combination of scattering and secular interactions .",
    "thereafter , the strong tidal interactions between the planet and its host star at periastron extract energy from the planetary orbit , leaving behind a giant planet on a circular orbit with @xmath5 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "several of the observed properties of the giant exoplanet population support the high - eccentricity scenario . @xcite and @xcite identified a `` three - day pile - up '' of hot jupiters ",
    "an enhancement in the occurrence rate @xmath6 at @xmath7 days  which is compatible with the action of tidal circularization .",
    "@xcite showed that this pile - up is also apparent in the sample of metal - rich _ kepler _ giant - planet - candidate host stars , although not among the more metal - poor giant - planet - candidate hosts .",
    "they argued that this is a natural outcome of planet ",
    "planet scattering .",
    "the reason is that metal - rich stars likely had protoplanetary disks with more solid material and therefore a better chance of forming a multiple - giant - planet system that could undergo planet ",
    "planet scattering .",
    "protoplanetary disk around more metal - poor stars likely had less solid material and therefore rarely produced multiple - giant - planet systems capable of strong scattering . in addition , the discovery of hot jupiters for which the orbit is significantly misaligned with the rotation of the host star is seemingly at odds with disk migration , and naturally explained by high - eccentricity migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also widely cited as support for high - eccentricity migration is the idea that hot jupiters seem to be less likely than other types of planets to be found with additional planetary companions . in other words ,",
    "hot jupiters have a reputation as `` lonely '' planets .",
    "this inference relies on a generic prediction of the high - eccentricity migration scenario : in systems with a hot jupiter , there should be few if any planets exterior to the hot jupiter and interior to the water - ice line . the body that gained the angular momentum lost by the hot - jupiter progenitor must be exterior to the water - ice line . at the same time ,",
    "any pre - existing planets interior to the water - ice line would have been destabilized during the high - eccentricity phase of the migration process , leading to the ejection of that planet from that region or the interference with the tidal circularization process .",
    "furthermore , some variants of high - eccentricity migration rely on kozai - lidov oscillations excited by a stellar companion , which are incapable of exciting high eccentricities in the presence of companion planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to hot jupiters , the population of `` warm jupiters '' with @xmath1 days probably did not form through high - eccentricity migration , as star ",
    "planet tidal interactions at their more distant periastron distances are not strong enough to shrink their orbits .",
    "moreover , the possibility that warm jupiters are actively circularizing and are being observed in a low - eccentricity phase of long - timescale kozai - lidov oscillations been investigated and found to be in tension with results from doppler surveys and the _ kepler _ survey @xcite .",
    "the high - eccentricity scenario singles out hot jupiters and predicts they will have different companion statistics than warm jupiters .",
    "the frequency of long - period companions to hot jupiters therefore provides an observational test .",
    "if the occurrence rate of long - period companions to hot jupiters inside the water - ice line were systematically lower than the equivalent occurrence rate for cooler giant planets , it would support the high - eccentricity migration scenario . on the other hand , if the occurrence rates were comparable , it would disfavor the high - eccentricity migration scenario .",
    "this work was motivated by the fact that we were aware of the widely cited statement that hot jupiters are lonely , but could not find in the literature any quantitative results for the conditional probability for a hot jupiter to have a companion inside the water - ice line .",
    "previous studies of the `` loneliness '' phenomenon have generally used different metrics or had other features that prevented us from performing the exact tests mentioned above .",
    "@xcite found the distribution of orbital distances of all the planets in multiple - planet systems to be different from that of all the single - planet systems .",
    "in particular , the three - day pile - up discovered by @xcite was absent from the multiple - planet systems .",
    "the sample analyzed by @xcite included systems discovered by both the doppler and transit techniques .",
    "because the transit technique is especially biased toward short - period planets , many of the apparently single systems analyzed by @xcite may have long - period giant planet companions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that short - period _ kepler _ giant planet candidates are less likely to have small - planet candidate companions than close - in neptune - sized planet candidates or more distant giant - planet candidates .",
    "more than 50% of the giant planet candidates discovered by _",
    "kepler _ have now been shown to be astrophysical false positives @xcite .",
    "the false - positive rate for small - planet candidates appears to be much smaller @xcite .",
    "an astrophysical false positive would be much less likely to present evidence of additional planets than a genuine exoplanet system .    a direct approach to measuring",
    "the companion probability for close - in giant planets is to undertake long - term doppler observations of stars known to have such planets .",
    "several groups have embarked on such efforts .",
    "@xcite searched 48 systems with close - in jupiter mass planets for long - period companions , finding 14 systems likely to have an external companion .",
    "assuming a double - power law for the companion mass  semimajor axis distribution , they found that approximately 50% of their targets have a companion in the range 1 au @xmath8 au and @xmath9 .",
    "the same group has expanded their search for companions using direct imaging to find distant companions and infrared spectroscopy to find close companions @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite expanded their sample beyond hot jupiter hosts to include giant planets over a broader range of orbital distances .",
    "they found that the occurrence of companions in the range @xmath10 and 5 au @xmath11 20 au may be higher for hot jupiters than for cooler giant planets .",
    "that result is subject to the caveat that the companion statistics may be systematically affected by stellar jitter ( poorly understood , time - correlated radial - velocity noise ) , the effect of which is magnified in their hot jupiter sample because of a relative lack of radial velocity measurements .",
    "they also did not make the specific comparison between hot and cool jupiters in the occurrence of companions within the water - ice line .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the occurrence of long - period giant - planet companions to both hot jupiters and more distant giant planets .",
    "we consider exterior companions both inside the water - ice line and out to the completeness limit of our input sample .",
    "we find that contrary to the expectation from the high - eccentricity migration scenario , there is no significant difference in the companion fraction for hot jupiters and more distant giant planets .",
    "the same result applies to companions both inside the water - ice line and out to the completeness limit of our input data .",
    "we describe our sample definition in section 2 , we detail our analysis procedures in section 3 , we discuss the results and implications in section 4 , and we summarize our findings in section 5 .",
    "we would like to calculate @xmath12 , the conditional probability that a long - period jupiter - mass planet exists in a system given that it has a hot jupiter . rather than directly measuring this quantity with long - term doppler observations and high - contrast imaging ,",
    "we calculate it using bayes theorem and publicly available data .",
    "in particular , we use ( i ) the occurrence rates for giant planets as a function of mass and orbital distance reported by @xcite ; ( ii ) the occurrence rate for hot jupiters reported by @xcite ; and ( iii ) a sample of giant planets discovered by the doppler technique",
    ". we will refer to these data as the `` doppler sample '' and describe its construction below .",
    "the planets discovered by the doppler technique typically orbit bright host stars that have been been subject to long - term high - precision radial - velocity measurements , in some cases for more than 20 years .",
    "this sample therefore provides the sensitivity to @xmath13 planets at @xmath14 days and to @xmath15 planets at @xmath16 days @xcite .",
    "we use ` exoplanets.org ` to identify all giant exoplanets with @xmath17 discovered by the doppler technique @xcite .",
    "we exclude systems that were first discovered using the transit technique , because of the extreme bias of the transit technique toward short - period planets ( figure  [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "we also wish to exclude evolved stars , because they have markedly different giant - planet population statistics that may be due to tidal evolution or other effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to identify and exclude evolved stars , we obtain for each star the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes and tycho @xmath18 colors from @xcite and apparent tycho-2 @xmath19-band magnitudes from @xcite",
    "we then select for main - sequence fgk stars showing little or no evolution , using the criteria @xmath20 and @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22    and    @xmath23    where the coefficients @xmath24 are taken from @xcite and represent the average _ hipparcos _ main sequence in the tycho-2 system = ( 1.11255 , 5.79062 , @xmath25 , 76.47777 , @xmath26 , 127.38044 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , 14.07945 , @xmath29 ) . ] .",
    "because of this criterion we are forced to reject all planets orbiting stars without _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .",
    "we are left with 266 giant planets orbiting 225 different stars and 35 multiple - giant - planet systems .",
    "we list these systems in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the multiple - giant - planet systems are the focus of this study , and we plot them in figure  [ fig02 ] .",
    "we only use the doppler sample to count interior giant - planet companions to announced long - period giant planets .",
    "since the radial velocity signal of interior giant planets always has a shorter period and usually a larger amplitude than more distant giant planets , the doppler sample should be complete to such planets .",
    "we plot the giant planet occurrence from @xcite and @xcite as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in figure  [ fig03 ] .",
    "we assume that there is not a significant undiscovered population of short - period giant planets in systems with at least one long - period giant planet .",
    "given the biases of the doppler technique and the search strategy of existing doppler surveys , this should be a safe assumption .",
    "in addition , we assume that the long - period giant planet occurrence rate observed by @xcite applies to the unobserved long - period giant planet population in the larger sample of stars analyzed by @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the probability that a star hosts a hot jupiter , as defined by @xcite : a planet with @xmath33 and @xmath0 days .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the probability that an fgk star hosts a long - period jovian planet , defined here as a planet with @xmath35 and 10 days @xmath36 days .",
    "the outer limit of 4080 days is adopted to match that of @xcite , whose results are necessary for our analysis .",
    "then by bayes theorem , the conditional probability @xmath37 that a system has a long - period giant planet given that it has a hot jupiter is    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the conditional probability that a system with a long - period giant planet has a hot jupiter , @xmath40 is the probability that a system with no long - period giant planet has a hot jupiter , and @xmath41 is the probability that a system has no long - period giant planet .",
    "first we will compute @xmath39 .",
    "the doppler sample contains 136 systems with at least one long - period giant planet , according the definition given above .",
    "the doppler sample also includes four systems with both a hot jupiter and at least one long - period companion : @xmath42 and , hip 14810 , hd 187123 , and hd 217107 .",
    "however , hd 217107c has an orbital period @xmath43 days , which is outside of the period range defined in table 1 of @xcite and can not be used in this analysis .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 .",
    "we calculate our uncertainties using a binomial distribution and an uninformative beta@xmath45 ) prior ( see section 3.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the hot jupiter probability @xmath32 has already been the subject of a careful study by @xcite .",
    "they found 10 hot jupiters in their sample of 836 stars , using the criteria defined above , giving @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath34 we rely on the work by @xcite .",
    "they found that 8.5% of fgk stars have a @xmath15 planet in the range 11.5 days @xmath47 days ( or 0.1 au @xmath48 au ) , giving @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "to determine @xmath40 , we note that two of the 10 hot jupiters in the sample of @xcite have longer - period companions .",
    "none of the other eight hot jupiters have longer - period companions . although the sample of 836 stars from which they are drawn has not been searched completely , we know from the occurrence rates of @xcite that 8.5% of them ( on average ) have longer - period companions . therefore @xmath51 = 0.010_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$ ] .",
    "we now have measurements and uncertainties for all the quantities on the right side of equation ( 3 ) . plugging in the numbers",
    "reveals that @xmath52 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result to @xmath53 .",
    "evidently , the fact that a hot jupiter has been observed in a system increases the probability that another giant planet will be found within 5 au in the same system , by nearly a factor of two ( with a large statistical uncertainty ) .    to test the prediction of the high - eccentricity migration scenario , we need to calculate @xmath37 for the specific case of companions that are inside the water - ice line .",
    "@xcite determined that the water - ice line in a solar - composition protoplanetary disk around a sun - like star during the planet formation epoch is at @xmath54 au , or @xmath55 days .",
    "hence we define a long - period jovian planet inside the water - ice line ( insideicejup ) as a planet with @xmath56 and 10 days @xmath57 days , and repeat the calculation from the preceding paragraph . using this revised definition ,",
    "only the @xmath42  and and hip  14810 systems have both a hot jupiter and at least one long - period companion , and there are 105 systems with at least one long - period giant planet .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 is the same as before .",
    "the overall giant - planet occurrence rate from @xcite is now 3.9% for fgk stars in the range 11.5 days @xmath60 days ( or 0.1 au @xmath61 au ) , giving @xmath62 and @xmath63 . only @xmath42 and b is in the sample of @xcite , so @xmath64 = 0.011_{-0.004}^{+0.004}$ ] . once again using equation ( 3 ) with insideicejup in place of longperjup , we find that @xmath65 .    to complete the test of the high - eccentricity migration scenario ,",

    "because the sample in @xcite is specific to hot jupiters , in the general calculation we only use the sample of multiple - giant - planet systems described in section 2 and the data in table 1 of @xcite .",

    "<S> the origin of jupiter - mass planets with orbital periods of only a few days is still uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> it is widely believed that these planets formed near the water - ice line of the protoplanetary disk , and subsequently migrated into much smaller orbits . </S>",
    "<S> most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified either as disk - driven migration , or as excitation of a very high eccentricity followed by tidal circularization . in the latter scenario , the giant planet that is destined to become </S>",
    "<S> a hot jupiter spends billions of years on a highly - eccentric orbit , with apastron near the water - ice line . eventually , tidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> if this is correct , then it should be especially rare for hot jupiters to be accompanied by another giant planet interior to the water - ice line . using the current sample of giant planets discovered with the doppler technique , we find that hot jupiters with @xmath0 days are no more or less likely to have exterior jupiter - mass companions than longer - period giant planets with @xmath1 days . </S>",
    "<S> this result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the approximate location of the water - ice line . </S>",
    "<S> these results are difficult to reconcile with the high - eccentricity migration scenario for hot jupiter formation . </S>"
