    "in this paper , we investigate the problem of mining numerical data .",
    "this problem arises in many practical situations , e.g. analysis of gene and transcriptomic data in biology , soil characteristics and land occupation in agronomy , demographic data in economics , temperatures in climate analysis , etc .",
    "we introduce an original framework for mining numerical data based on advances in itemset mining and in formal concept analysis ( fca ,  @xcite ) , respectively condensed representations of itemsets and pattern structures in fca  @xcite .",
    "the mining of frequent itemsets in binary data , considering a set of objects and a set of associated attributes or items , is studied for a long time and usually involves the so - called `` pattern flooding '' problem @xcite .",
    "a way of dealing with pattern flooding is to search for equivalence classes of itemsets , i.e. itemsets shared by the same set of objects ( or having the same image ) . for an equivalence class , there is one maximal itemset , which corresponds to a `` closed set '' , and possibly several minimal elements corresponding to `` generators '' ( or `` key itemsets '' ) . from these elements , families of association rules",
    "can be extracted .",
    "these itemsets are also related to fca , where a concept lattice is built from a binary context and where formal concepts are closed sets of objects and attributes .",
    "the present work is rooted both in fca and pattern mining with the objective of extracting interval patterns from numerical data .",
    "our approach is based on `` pattern structures '' where complex descriptions can be associated with objects . in  @xcite",
    "we introduced closed interval patterns in the context of gene expression data mining .",
    "intuitively , an interval pattern is a vector of intervals , each dimension corresponding to a range of values of a given attribute ; it is closed when composed of the smallest intervals characterizing a same set of objects .    in the present paper , we complete and extend this first attempt . considering numerical data , some general characteristics of equivalence classes remain , e.g. one maximal element which is a closed pattern and possibly several generators which are minimal patterns w.r.t . a subsumption relation defined on patterns .",
    "we show that directly extracting patterns data from numerical is more efficient using pattern structures than working on binary data with associated scaling procedures .",
    "we also provide a semantics to interval patterns in the euclidean space , design and experiment algorithms to extract frequent closed interval patterns and their generators .",
    "the problem of mining patterns in numerical data is usually referred as quantitative itemset / association rule mining  @xcite .",
    "generally , an appropriate discretization splits attribute ranges into intervals maximizing some interest functions , e.g. support , confidence . however",
    ", none of these works covers the notion of equivalence classes , closed patterns , and generators , and this is one of the originality of the present paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "firstly , we introduce the problem of mining numerical data and interval patterns .",
    "then , we recall the basics of fca and interordinal scaling .",
    "we pose a number of questions that we propose to answer using our framework of interval pattern structures dealing with numerical data .",
    "we then detail two original algorithms for extracting closed interval patterns and their generators .",
    "these algorithms are evaluated in the last section on real - world data .",
    "finally , we end the paper in discussing related work and giving perspectives to the present research work . as a complement , an extended version of this paper",
    "is given in  @xcite , providing algorithms pseudo - code and a longer discussion on the usefulness of interval patterns in classification problems and privacy preserving data - mining .",
    "we propose a definition of interval patterns for numerical data .",
    "intuitively , each object of a numerical dataset corresponds to a vector of numbers , where each dimension stands for an attribute .",
    "accordingly , an interval pattern is a vector of intervals , and each dimension describes the range of a numerical attribute .",
    "we only consider finite intervals and that the set of attributes / dimensions is assumed to bed ( canonically ) ordered .",
    "a numerical dataset is given by a set of objects @xmath0 , a set of numerical attributes @xmath1 , where the range of @xmath2 is a finite set noted @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 means that @xmath5 is the value of attribute @xmath6 for object @xmath7 .    .a",
    "numerical dataset .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in both cases , using binary data is better when the minimal support is high ( e.g. 90% ) . for low supports , a critical issue , our algorithms deliver better execution times .",
    "most importantly , the global redundancy effect discards the use of binary data , e.g. only @xmath8 of all fisg are actually fipg in dataset bl .",
    "finally , the algorithm _ minintchangeg - t _ outperforms _ minintchangeg - h_. _ minintchangeg - t _ however needs more memory since it stores each closed set of objects as a word in the trie , and to each word the list of associated fipg .",
    "it is very interesting to analyse the compression ability of closed interval patterns and generators .",
    "for that , we compare in each dataset the number of those patterns w.r.t . to all possible interval patterns .",
    "it gives the ratio of closed ( generators ) in the whole search space . in both cases ,",
    "ratio varies between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the volume of useful interval patterns , either closed or generators , is very low w.r.t .",
    "the set of all possible interval patterns , justifying our interest in equivalence classes for interval patterns .",
    "we discussed the important problem of pattern discovery in numerical data with a new and original formalization of interval patterns .",
    "the classical fca / itemset - mining settings are adapted accordingly : from a closure operator naturally rise the notions of equivalence classes , closed and generator patterns , and we designed corresponding algorithms .",
    "an appropriate semantics of interval patterns shows from a theoretical ( redundancy ) and practical ( computation times ) points of view that mining equivalent binary data ( encoding all possible intervals ) is not acceptable .",
    "this is due to the fact that interval patterns are provided with a stronger partial ordering than is - itemsets ( classical set inclusion ) , hence pattern structures yield significantly less generators w.r.t .",
    "their semantics .    dealing with interval patterns has applications in computational geometry , machine learning and data - mining , e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is indeed highly related to the actual problem of ( maximal ) @xmath11-boxes which corresponds to interval patterns ( generators ) with support @xmath11 . when @xmath12 , it corresponds to largest empty subspaces of the data .",
    "our contribution to this field is the characterization of smaller subsets ( closed and generators ) .    in data - mining ,",
    "closed patterns and their generators are crucial for extracting valid and informative association rules  @xcite , while generators can be preferable to closed patterns following the minimum descriptions length principle for so - called itemset - based classifiers  @xcite .",
    "how these notions can be shifted to interval patterns is an original perspective of research rising questions concerning missing values , fault - tolerant patterns , and interestingness measures that are critical issues even in classical itemset mining : although the compression ability of closed interval patterns and generators is spectacular , the number of patterns remains too high for large datasets .",
    "however , bringing the problem of numerical pattern mining into well known settings in favor of these perspectives of research .",
