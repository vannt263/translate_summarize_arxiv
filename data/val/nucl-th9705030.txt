    "an interest in the constituent quark model ( cqm ) has recently been revitalized @xcite after recognizing the fact that the constituent ( dynamical ) mass of the light quarks appears as a direct consequence of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) @xcite and is related with the light quark condensates @xmath3 of the qcd vacuum .",
    "this feature becomes explicit in any microscopical approach to scsb in qcd , e.g. in the instanton gas ( liquid ) model @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the dynamical mass generation in the nambu - goldstone mode of chiral symmetry is very transparent within the @xmath4-model @xcite or nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the chiral symmetry in the nambu - goldstone mode is the appearance of an octet of goldstone bosons ( @xmath5 mesons ) .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that beyond the scale of scsb , nonstrange and strange baryons should be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks which interact via the exchange of goldstone bosons and are subject to confinement .",
    "this type of interaction between the constituent quarks provides a very satisfactory description of the low - lying nonstrange and strange baryon spectra @xcite including the correct ordering of the levels with positive and negative parity in all parts of the considered spectrum .",
    "so far , all studies of the short - range nn interaction within the constituent quark model were based on the one - gluon exchange interaction ( oge ) between quarks .",
    "they explained the short - range repulsion in the nn system as due to the colour - magnetic part of oge combined with quark interchanges between 3q clusters .",
    "( for reviews and earlier references see @xcite ) .",
    "there are also models which attribute the short - range repulsion in the nn system to the colour - electric part of oge @xcite .    in order to provide the necessary long- and intermediate - range attraction in the baryon - baryon system , hybrid models",
    "were suggested @xcite , where in addition to oge , the quarks belonging to different 3q clusters interact via pseudoscalar and scalar meson exchange . in these hybrid models",
    "the short - range repulsion in the nn system is still attributed to oge between the constituent quarks .",
    "it has been shown , however @xcite , that the hyperfine splittings as well as the correct ordering of positive and negative parity states in spectra of baryons with u , d , s quarks are produced in fact not by the colour - magnetic part of oge , but by the short - range part of the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) interaction .",
    "this short - range part of gbe has just opposite sign as compared to the yukawa tail of the gbe interaction and is much stronger at short interquark separations .",
    "there is practically no room for oge in light baryon spectroscopy and any appreciable amount of colour - magnetic interaction , in addition to gbe , destroys the spectrum @xcite .",
    "if so , the question arises which interquark interaction is responsible for the short - range nn repulsion .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that the same short - range part of gbe , which produces good baryon spectra , also induces a short - range repulsion in the nn system .",
    "the present study is rather exploratory .",
    "we calculate an effective nn interaction at zero separation distance only .",
    "we also want to stress that all main ingredients of the nn interaction , such as the long- and middle - range attraction and the short - range repulsion are implied by the chiral constituent quark model .",
    "indeed , the long- and middle - range attraction automatically appear in the present framework due to the long - range yukawa tail of the pion - exchange interaction between quarks belonging to different nucleons and due to 2@xmath6 ( or sigma ) exchanges .",
    "thus , the only important open question is whether or not the chiral constituent quark model is able to produce a short - range repulsion in the nn system .    for this purpose ,",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian of ref.@xcite in a six - quark harmonic oscillator basis up to two excitations quanta . using the born - oppenheimer ( adiabatic ) approximation",
    ", we obtain an effective internucleon potential at zero separation between nucleons from the difference between the lowest eigenvalue and two times the nucleon mass calculated in the same model .",
    "we find a strong effective repulsion between nucleons in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels of a height of 800 - 1300 mev .",
    "this repulsion implies a strong suppression of the nn wave function in the nucleon overlap region as compared to the wave function of the well separated nucleons .    due to the specific flavour - spin symmetry of the gbe interaction",
    ", we also find that the highly dominant 6q configuration at zero - separation between nucleons is @xmath7_o [ 51]_{fs}>$ ] . as a consequence the 6q region ( i.e. the nucleon overlap region )",
    "can not be adequately represented by the one - channel resonating group method ( rgm ) ansatz @xmath8 which is commonly used at present for the short - range nn interaction with the oge interaction .",
    "the symmetry structure @xmath9_o [ 51]_{fs}$ ] of the lowest configuration will induce an additional effective repulsion at short range related to the ",
    "pauli forbidden state \" in this case .",
    "this latter effective repulsion is not related to the energy of the lowest configuration as compared to two - nucleon threshold and thus can not be obtained within the born - oppenheimer approximation procedure .",
    "we notice , however , that the structure of the six - quark wave function in the nucleon overlap region is very different from the one associated with the soft or hard core @xmath10 potentials .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , in a qualitative analysis at the casimir operator level , we show that the short - range gbe interaction generates a repulsion between nucleons in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "we also suggest there that the configuration with the @xmath11_{fs}$ ] flavour - spin symmetry should be the dominant one .",
    "section 3 describes the hamiltonian .",
    "section 4 contains results of the diagonalization of the 6q hamiltonian and of the nn effective interaction at zero separation between nucleons .",
    "the structure of the short - range wave function is also discussed in this section . in section 5 , we show why the single - channel rgm ansatz is not adequate in the present case . in section 6 , we present a summary of our study .",
    "in order to have a preliminary qualitative insight it is convenient first to consider a schematic model which neglects the radial dependence of the gbe interaction . in this model the short - range part of the gbe interaction between the constituent quarks",
    "is approximated by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 with an implied summation over f ( f=1,2, ... ,8 ) and @xmath14 are the quark flavour gell - mann and spin matrices respectively .",
    "the minus sign of the interaction ( [ opfs ] ) is related to the sign of the short - range part of the pseudoscalar meson - exchange interaction ( which is opposite to that of the yukawa tail ) , crucial for the hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the constant @xmath15 can be determined from the @xmath16 splitting . for that purpose one",
    "only needs the spin ( s ) , flavour ( f ) and flavour - spin ( fs ) symmetries of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 states , identified by the corresponding partitions [ f ] associated with the groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath21_{fs } [ 3]_f [ 3]_s > .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the matrix elements of the interaction ( [ opfs ] ) are @xcite : @xmath22 hence @xmath23 , which gives @xmath24mev , if one uses the experimental value of 293 mev for the @xmath25 splitting .    to see the effect of the interaction ( [ opfs ] ) in the six - quark system ,",

    "the latter potential produces a very rich high - momentum component , which is in contradiction with the deuteron electromagnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "the high - momentum component , implied by a  very soft node \" , like in our case , will be much smaller and closer to that one obtained from the potentials with strong repulsive core",
    ".    we also see large projections onto other @xmath127 channels ( exemplified by the @xmath126 channel in fig .",
    "these components can not be taken into account in any simple @xmath10 potential , in principle .",
    "thus , if we are interested in effects , related to the short - range @xmath10 system , there is no way , other than to consider the full 6q wave function in this region .",
    "in this section we show that the currently used one - channel resonating group method ( rgm ) ansatz for the two - nucleon wave function is not adequate in a study of the short - range @xmath10 interaction with the chiral quark model .    in the one - channel rgm approximation",
    "the 6q wave function has the form @xmath141 this is reasonable in the case where the short - range quark dynamics is described in terms of the oge interaction . in this case",
    "the addition of new channels , orthogonal to ( [ wf ] ) , does not change considerably the full wave function in the nucleon overlap region .",
    "this is not the case for the chiral constituent quark model , where the short - range quark dynamics is due to the gbe interaction . to have a better insight why ( [ wf ] ) is a poor approximation in the present case",
    ", we begin with the explanation why ( [ wf ] ) is reasonable for oge model @xcite .    to this end",
    ", it is very convenient to use the six - quark shell model basis for the nn function in the nucleon overlap region @xcite .",
    "such a basis is much more flexible than ( [ wf ] ) . diagonalizing a hamiltonian comprising oge and a confining interaction in the harmonic oscillator basis up to two excitation quanta",
    ", one can obtain the 6q wave function in the form @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath99 lists all possible configurations in the n=2 shell : @xmath143_o [ 222]_{cs}$ ] , @xmath9_o [ 42]_{cs}$ ] , @xmath9_o [ 321]_{cs}$ ] , @xmath9_o [ 222]_{cs}$ ] , @xmath9_o [ 3111]_{cs}$ ] , @xmath9_o [ 21111]_{cs}$ ] . with the oge interaction , the cs coupling scheme based on the chain",
    "@xmath144 is more convenient .",
    "it has been found that there are a few most important configurations - @xmath145_o[222]_{cs } > , |s^4p^2 [ 42]_o [ 42]_{cs } > , |s^4p^2 [ 42]_o [ 321]_{cs } > , |(\\sqrt{5/6 } s^52s - \\sqrt{1/6 } s^4p^2 ) [ 6]_o [ 222]_{cs}>$ ] - with sizeable amplitudes @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "now , let us expand the rgm wave function ( [ wf ] ) in the shell model basis .",
    "for that purpose , the trial function @xmath147 in ( [ wf ] ) should be expanded in a harmonic oscillator basis too @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a harmonic oscillator state with n quanta and @xmath121 .",
    "thus in the ansatz ( [ wf ] ) the variational coefficients based on the expansion ( [ exp ] ) are @xmath150 .",
    "the last step is to use the expressions ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath151 , @xmath152 , written in the shell model basis",
    ". these are transformations from one basis to another and do not depend on the 6q dynamics .",
    "if it turns out that for a given hamiltonian the variational coefficients @xmath146 in ( [ sum ] ) are close to the algebraical ones , then one can conclude that ( [ wf ] ) is a good approximation for the variational solution ( [ sum ] ) .",

    "diagonalizing a hamiltonian in a basis consisting of the most important 6q configurations in the nucleon overlap region , we have found a very strong effective repulsion of the order of 1 gev in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath10 partial waves . due to the specific flavour - spin symmetry of the goldstone boson exchange interaction the configuration @xmath7_o [ 51]_{fs}>$ ] becomes highly dominant at short range . as a consequence",
