    "the origin of cp violation , is one of the outstanding problems of particle physics today .",
    "so far cp violation has only been observed in the neutral kaon system .",
    "the observed cp violation can be explained in many models .",
    "it is therefore important to study other cp violating experimental observables and compare the results with different model predictions .",
    "such study may reveal the real origin of cp violation .    in the minimal @xmath2 standard model ( msm )",
    ", there is only one higgs doublet .",
    "when the higgs develops valcuum expectation value ( vev ) v , all fermion receive masses . in the mass eigenstate basis , the higgs coupling to fermions is diagonal , it does not mediate cp violating interaction .",
    "however , the coupling of the charged current to the w - boson becomes complex .",
    "it is given by @xmath3 where the matrix @xmath4 is the ckm matrix @xmath5@xcite .",
    "for three generations of quarks , there is a non - removable phase in the matrix .",
    "this is the source of cp violation in the msm .",
    "this matrix is conveniently parametrized as , following wolfenstein @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , cp is violated .",
    "unitarity constraints on the matrix elements provide very powerful and interesting realtions .",
    "the most interesting one is the triangle defined by @xmath9 in the wolfenstein parametrization , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 this defines the triangle shown in figure 1 with three angles @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the area of the triangle is given by @xmath16 .",
    "cp violation in the neutral kaon system can be explained by the `` box '' interaction@xcite .",
    "if cp violation due to the phase in the ckm matrix is the only source for cp violation , experiments at b factories will be able to determine all the three angles@xcite .",
    "another class of model for cp violation is the multi - higgs doublet model . if there are more than one higgs doublets , the neutral scalar couplings to the quarks are not necessarily diagonal , and therefore provide new sources for cp violation@xcite .",
    "cp violation can arise in three places in this type of models : 1 ) non - trivial phase in the @xmath5 matrix ; 2)non - trivial phases in the yukawa couplings ; and 3 ) mixings of scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons . in cases 2 ) and 3 ) , cp violation can occurs at the tree level by exchanging neutral higgs bosons . in this talk",
    "we will present some studies of cp violation in multi - higgs models with flavour changing neutral currents at the trre level which has cp violation predominantly throug mechanisms 2 ) and 3 ) .",
    "a most general study suffers from too many free parameters . to have a definite idea , we carry out the study in a @xmath17 model proposed by ma@xcite .",
    "this model has some very interesting predictions for fermion masses and their mixings .",
    "it also has interesting predictions for cp violation@xcite .",
    "we study the predictions for : ( i ) @xmath1 ; ( ii ) cp violation in the neutral b system ; and ( iii ) the neutron and electron electric dipole moments ( edm ) .",
    "we compare these predictions with those in the msm .",
    "in the @xmath17 model , there are four higgs doublets , @xmath18 .",
    "the quarks and higgs bosons transform under the @xmath17 symmetry as@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the @xmath22 element .",
    "the yukawa couplings consistent with the @xmath17 symmetry are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "without loss of generality we work in a basis where all vevs are real .",
    "the up - quark mass matrix is diagonal : @xmath25 , and the down - quark mass matrix can be written as , with a suitable choice of quark phases , @xmath26 with a , b , c , d real and @xmath27 complex .",
    "@xmath28 can be diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the diagonalized down quark mass matrix . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are unitary matrices . because the up quark mass matrix is already diagonalized , @xmath33 is the ckm matrix @xmath5 .",
    "it is convenient to work in a basis of the higgs bosons in which the goldstone bosons are removed . to this end",
    "we define the following@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the transformation is the same for both the neutral and charged higgs bosons . for the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the goldstone boson eaten by z , and",
    "@xmath40 is a physical field whose couplings are the same as the higgs boson in the msm",
    ". for the charged higgs bosons g is the goldstone boson eaten by w. in this basis , we have    @xmath41    where @xmath42 are the component fields of @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the couplings @xmath47 can be easily expressed in term of quark masses , @xmath48 , and vevs .    in general @xmath49",
    "are not the mass eigenstates .",
    "we can parametrize the mixings as @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the mass eigenstates , the matrix @xmath54 is a @xmath55 othogonal matrix , and @xmath56 is a @xmath57 unitary matrix .",
    "the specific values for the mixings depend on the details of the higgs potential .",
    "unfortunately they are not determined .",
    "to simplify the problem , we will discuss two cases : a ) cp violation only comes from complex yukawa couplings ; and b ) cp violation only comes from the mixings of real and imaginary @xmath58@xcite .",
    "case a ) can be realised by constraining certain soft symmetry breaking terms in the potential@xcite .",
    "we further assume , for simplicity , that @xmath59 are the mass eigenstate @xmath51 and consider their effects .",
    "the same analysis can be easily carried out for @xmath60 in the same way .",
    "the source for cp violation is the non - zero value for @xmath61 which is a free parameter .",
    "we will present our results for @xmath62 , which is close to the maximum of the allowed phase .",
    "case b ) can be realised by requiring spontaneous cp violation .",
    "the value of @xmath61 will be zero and cp violation arises due to scalar - pesudoscalar higgs boson mixing .",

    "we shall comment on effects of changing these values later .",
    "the @xmath17 model has very restrictive allowed values for the non - trivial cp violating phase in the ckm matrix .",
