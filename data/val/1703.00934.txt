    "wd stars constitute the ultimate fate of most the stars that populate the universe , including our sun . indeed ,",
    "single stars that born with masses below @xmath0 ( woosley & heger 2015 ) will end their lives as wds .",
    "typical ages of wds are in the range @xmath1 gyr ( 1 gyr @xmath2 yr ) .",
    "details about the formation and evolution of wds can be found in the review papers of winget & kepler ( 2008 ) , fontaine & brassard ( 2008 ) , and althaus et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . here , we only give a brief summary of the main characteristics of these stars .",
    "wds are characterized by stellar masses comparable to the mass of the sun ( @xmath3 ) but with sizes of the order of the size of planets ( @xmath4 ) , which implies very high mean densities ( @xmath5 gr/@xmath6 ) and strong degeneration of matter . in particular , the equation of state describing the mechanical properties of wds is that of a fermi gas of degenerate electrons ( chandrasekhar 1939 ) , which provides most of the pressure that counteracts the force of gravity , thus preventing the collapse .",
    "immersed in this sea of electrons and decoupled thereof coexists a non - degenerate gas of ions that provide the heat reservoir of the star , resulting from the previous evolutionary history .",
    "wds cover a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath7 k ) and hence a large interval of luminosities ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "average mass wds ( @xmath9 ) harbor cores likely made of @xmath10c and @xmath11o , although massive wds could have cores made of @xmath11o , @xmath12ne y @xmath13 mg , and the lowest - mass wds ( extremely low mass wds , abbreviated as elm wds ) could contain cores of @xmath14he .",
    "roughly speaking , wd evolution is nothing but a slow cooling ( mestel 1952 ) , in which the star gets rid of its thermal energy content into space , being the nuclear energy sources ( nuclear burning ) almost extinct .",
    "the rate at which this heat is removed ( i.e. , the cooling rate of the wd ) is controlled by the outer layers of the star . according to the chemical composition of the outer layers , wds come in two main flavors : das ( @xmath15 , almost pure - h atmospheres ) and dbs ( @xmath16 , almost pure - he atmospheres ) , although there are also some wds which show atmospheres of he , c , and o ( pg1159 stars ) or c and he ( dq wds ) .",
    "we have to add to this list the dz wds , which show only metal lines , without h or he present .",
    "finally , there is the exotic object called sdssj1240 + 6710 , that has an almost pure o atmosphere , diluted only by traces of ne , mg , and si ( kepler et al .",
    "2016a ) . in the case of da and db wds , the purity in the surface chemical composition is the result of the extremely high surface gravity ( @xmath17 [ cm / s@xmath18 ) , which results in the settling of the heavier elements , leaving the lightest nuclear species to float at the stellar surface .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we plot the internal chemical structure of a typical da wd model with @xmath19 and @xmath20 k. for instructional purposes , we have included in the figure a brief explanation indicating the origin of each feature in the chemical structure of the star .",
    "note that the adopted @xmath21-coordinate , @xmath22 , strongly amplifies the outer part of the star . as it can be seen in the figure , in a typical wd star",
    "the @xmath23 of the mass is made of a mixture of @xmath10c and @xmath11o in uncertain proportions , being the @xmath24he content of @xmath25 at most , and the @xmath26h content at the envelope of @xmath27 .",
    "the number of known wd stars is increasing fast thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "in fact , sdss increased the number of spectroscopically - confirmed wd stars more than an order of magnitude prior to the sdss ( see kepler et al .",
    "at present , there is a total of around @xmath28 wds identified , @xmath29 of which are from dr7 ( kleinman et al .",
    "2013 ) , dr10 ( kepler et al .",
    "2015 ) and dr12 ( kepler et al 2016b ) of sdss , and @xmath30 correspond to the mccook & sion ( 1999 ) catalog ( s. o. kepler , private communication ) .",
    "and @xmath20 k. plotted is the mass fraction ( @xmath31 ) of @xmath11o , @xmath10c , @xmath24he , and @xmath26h in terms of the outer mass coordinate .",
    "we include in the plot a brief explanation about the origin of each part of the internal chemical structure .",
    "also , we indicate a few values of the percentage of the total mass of the star associated to the outer mass coordinate.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    wds are very old objects , so they harbor valuable information about the history of our galaxy . as such , these exotic objects have application to various fields of modern astrophysics :    * cosmochronology : the derivation of the ages of stellar populations using the wd luminosity function .",
    "wds provide independent chronometers for the age and star formation history of the galactic disk ( e.g. , harris et al .",
    "2006 ) , and halo ( isern et al . 1998 ) through cosmochronology .",
    "furthermore , wd cosmochronology can be applied to galactic globular clusters ( hansen et al . 2013 ) and open clusters ( e.g. , garca - berro et al . 2010 ) as well . *",
    "initial to final mass relation ( ifmr ; cataln et al .",
    "2008 ) : more than 95 % of stars will end their lives as wds , so that they can be considered as a boundary condition for stellar evolution .",
    "the difference between the initial main sequence masses and the final wd masses highlights the role of mass - loss during the agb phase . * progenitors of snia , cataclysmic variables ( novae ) : energetic events ( @xmath32 erg ) of mass transfer on the wd by its companion .",
    "* cosmic laboratories : the interiors of wds are composed of matter under extreme conditions ( that is , extremely high density and pressure ) .",
    "this allows the study of equation of state ( eos ) , crystallization , particle physics , fundamental constant variations .    until recent years",
    ", the only available tools for studying wds were spectroscopy , that provides @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the surface chemical composition , the magnitude of magnetic fields , and photometry , that allows to infer the stellar mass .",
    "these techniques provide global information of the wds .",
    "but , in what way could we dig beneath the surface layers of these stars ?",
    "wd asteroseismology , that is , the comparison of the observed pulsational spectrum of variable wds with that emerging from theoretical models of evolution and pulsations , comes to help ( winget & kepler 2008 ; fontaine & brassard 2008 ; althaus et al .",
    "asteroseismology allows to `` see '' inside these stars , otherwise inaccessible by other means ( catelan & smith 2015 ) .",
    "wd asteroseismology allows to infer the chemical stratification , the core chemical composition , and the stellar masses , to measure rotation and magnetic fields , to detect planets around wds , and to probe for exotic particles that are strong candidates for dark matter , like axions .",
    "within the framework of the linear theory of stellar pulsations , in which the perturbations of the stellar fluid are assumed to be small , spheroidal nonradial stellar pulsations are described by the lagrangian displacement vector ( unno et al .",
    "1989 ) :    @xmath35 y^m_{\\ell } e^{i \\sigma_{k \\ell m } t},\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 are the spherical harmonic functions , @xmath37 is the pulsation eigenfrequency , and @xmath38 y @xmath39 are the radial and horizontal eigenfunctions , respectively , of the eigenmode characterized by the set of quantum numbers @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in the linear theory of pulsations , the eigenmodes are described by a sinusoidal temporal dependence given by the factor @xmath41 , an angular dependence defined by the spherical harmonics @xmath36 , and a radial dependence through the eigenfunctions @xmath38 y @xmath39 , which have to be determined by numerically solving the set of differential equations= constant ) sphere , that admits an analytic solution ( pekeris 1938 ) , although such a configuration is not of much astronomical relevance . ] that describe the nonradial pulsations ( unno et al .",
    "this set is a fourth - order system of equations in real variables in the adiabatic approximation , and a sixth - order system of equations in complex variables for the full problem of nonadiabatic pulsations .",
    "the quantum numbers are defined as : ( 1 ) harmonic degree , @xmath42 , that represents @xmath43 nodal lines ( parallel circles ) on the stellar surface ; ( 2 ) azimuthal order , @xmath44 , that represents nodal lines ( meridian circles ) on the stellar surface , and ( 3 ) radial order , @xmath45 , that represent nodal concentric spherical surfaces on which the displacement is null .",
    "we note that in the absence of any physical agent able to remove spherical symmetry , such as magnetic fields or rotation , the eigenfrequencies are @xmath46-fold degenerate in @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show an illustration of single spherical harmonics .     and its three - dimensional representation .",
    "figures adapted from www.atmos.albany.edu.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    there exist three families of spheroidal pulsation modes : ( 1 ) @xmath48 modes : characterized by large pressure variations and displacements mostly in the radial direction , the dominant restoring force being the compressibility .",
    "@xmath48 modes have high frequencies ( short periods ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath49 modes : characterized by small pressure variations and displacements almost tangential , being the dominant restoring force is the buoyancy .",
    "@xmath49 modes have low frequency ( long periods ) ; ( 3 ) @xmath50 modes : have intermediate characteristics between @xmath48 and @xmath49 modes , and exist only for @xmath51 .",
    "generally , these modes do not have nodes in the radial direction ( @xmath52 ) , except for stellar models with a high central density .",
    "the first pulsating wd star , hl tau 76 , was discovered by landolt ( 1968 ) .",
    "pulsating wds exhibit @xmath49-mode pulsations with @xmath53 and @xmath54 could be excited in wds , but their detection should be hampered by geometric effects of cancellation ( dziembowski 1977 ) . ] .",
    "there is only one reported case of a pulsating wd ( specifically , a low - mass wd ) that could be pulsating with periods at @xmath55 s associated to @xmath48 modes or even radial ( @xmath56 ) modes and low radial order @xmath57 ( hermes et al .",
    "the amplitude of the variations of wd pulsations are typically between 0.005 y 0.4 mag . a plethora of light curves , some sinusoidal and with small amplitudes , other nonlinear and with large amplitudes , are observed .",
    "generally , pulsating wds are multimode pulsators , that is , they exhibit more than just a single period . in some cases",

    "two evolutionary tracks for low - mass he - core wds are plotted for reference .",
    "also shown with dashed lines are the theoretical blue edges of the different instability domains.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "an increasing number of kinds of wd pulsators has been discovered in the last years . at present , there are seven classes of pulsating wds . to begin with ,",
    "the variables zz ceti or davs ( pulsating wds with almost pure h atmospheres ) are the most numerous ones .",
    "the other classes comprise the dqvs ( atmospheres rich in he and c ) , the variables v777 her or dbvs ( atmospheres almost pure in he ) , the hot davs ( h - rich atmospheres ) , and the variables gw vir or pulsating pg1159 pre - wd stars ( atmospheres dominated by c , o , and he ) that include the dovs and pnnvs objects . to these families of pulsating wd stars , we have to add the elmvs ( extremely low - mass wds variable ) and the pre - elmvs ( the probable precursors of elmvs ) . in fig . [ fig:3 ]",
    "we depict the location of the several families of pulsating wds known hitherto in the @xmath58 plane .    regarding the driving mechanisms involved in the excitation of the pulsations in wds , there is a strong consensus that they correspond to thermal processes that give place to self - excited pulsations .",
    "the more relevant mechanism is the @xmath59 mechanism acting in partial ionization regions of the dominant chemical element : h@xmath60 ( davs , elmvs ) , he@xmath60 ( dbvs ) , he@xmath61 ( pre - elmvs ) , c@xmath62 and and o@xmath63 ( pulsating pg119 pre - wd stars ) .",
    "when the outer convection zone deepens , wd pulsations are excited by the `` convective driving '' mechanism ( davs , dbvs , elmvs ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath64 mechanism due to stable nuclear burning could be responsible for the excitation of short - period @xmath49 modes in gw vir stars ( he burning ; crsico et al .",
    "2009 ) , elmvs ( h burning ; crsico et al .",

    "<S> at present , a large number of pulsating white dwarf ( wd ) stars is being discovered either from earth - based surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey , or through observations from space ( e.g. , the kepler mission ) . </S>",
    "<S> the asteroseismological techniques allow us to infer details of internal chemical stratification , the total mass , and even the stellar rotation profile . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we first describe the basic properties of wd stars and their pulsations , as well as the different sub - types of these variables known so far . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we describe some recent findings about pulsating low - mass wds .    1.0 cm    pulsating white dwarfs and asteroseismology    actualmente , un gran nmero de estrellas enanas blancas variables pulsantes est siendo decubierto ya sea a partir de relevamientos basados en observaciones desde tierra , tales como el sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , u observaciones desde el espacio ( por ejemplo , la misin kepler ) . </S>",
