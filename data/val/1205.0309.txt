    "we demonstrate a robustness to mis - specification of rank@xmath4 ; in particular , if a practitioner overestimates the rank of @xmath4 in carrying out adjacency spectral partitioning to estimate the blocks , then the consistency of the procedure is not lost .",
    "indeed , this is a model selection result , and we provide estimators for @xmath1 and prove their consistency .",
    "our analysis and results are valid for both directed and undirected graphs .",
    "we also allow for more than one modality of adjacency .",
    "for instance , the stochastic block model can model a social network in which the vertices are people , and the blocks are different communities within the network such that probabilities of communication between individual people are community dependent , and there is available information about several different modes of communication between the people ; e.g.  who phoned whom on cell phones , who phoned whom on land lines , who sent email to whom , who sent snail mail to whom , with a separate adjacency matrix for each modality of communication .",
    "indeed , if there are different matrices @xmath4 for each mode of communication , even if there is dependence in the communications between two people across different modalities , our analysis and results will hold  provided that every pair of blocks is  probabilistically discernable \" within at least one mode of communication .",

    "taking these words to heart , our focus in this article is on showing a robustness in the consistency of spectral partitioning in the stochastic block model when using the adjacency matrix .",
    "our focus is on removing the need to know a priori the parameters , and to still attain consistency in partitioning .",
    "this robustness opens the door to explore principled use of spectral techniques even for settings where the stochastic block model assumptions do not strictly hold , and we anticipate more future progress in consistency results for spectral partitioning in nonparametric models .",
    "we conclude the article with additional discussion of consistent estimation of @xmath1 ( section  [ nnn ] ) , illustrative simulations ( section [ ppp ] ) , and a brief discussion ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",

    "the model is defined ( and the parameters have roles ) as follows :    there are @xmath0 vertices , labeled @xmath15 , and they are each randomly assigned to blocks labeled @xmath16 by a random _ block membership function _",

    "conditioned on @xmath27 , the probability of there being an @xmath23 edge is @xmath28 , independently of the other pairs of vertices .",
    "our analysis and results will cover both the _ undirected setting _ in which edges are unordered pairs ( in particular , @xmath29 and @xmath4 are symmetric ) and also the _ directed setting _ in which edges are ordered pairs ( in particular , @xmath29 and @xmath4 are not necessarily symmetric ) . in both settings the diagonals of @xmath29 are all @xmath26 s ( i.e.  there are no  loops \" in the graph ) .",
    "we assume that the parameters of the stochastic block model are not known , except for one underlying assumption ; namely , that a positive integer @xmath30 is known that satisfies rank@xmath31 .",
    "( of course , @xmath30 may be taken to be rank@xmath4 or @xmath1 if either of these happen to be known . )",
    "however , for now through section [ f ] , we also assume that @xmath1 is known ; in section  [ e ] we will provide a consistent estimator for @xmath1 if @xmath1 is not known , and then in section  [ hhh ] we utilize this consistent estimator for @xmath1 to extend all of the previous procedures and results to the scenario where @xmath1 is also not known ( and then the only remaining assumption is our one underlying assumption that a positive integer @xmath30 is known such that rank@xmath31 ) .",
    "although the realized adjacency matrix @xmath29 is observed , the block membership function @xmath27 is not observed and , indeed , the inferential task here is to estimate @xmath27 . in section [ b ] ,",

    "block * assignment * function _",

    ". then theorem  [ a ] in section [ d ] asserts that almost always the number of misassignments @xmath33 is negligible .",
    "a more complicated scenario is where there are multiple  modalities of communication \" for the vertices . specifically , instead of one probability communication matrix",
    ", there are several probability communication matrices @xmath34^{k \\times k}$ ] which are all parameters of the model , and there are corresponding random adjacency matrices @xmath35 such that for each _ modality _ @xmath36 and for each pair of vertices @xmath23 that are distinct , @xmath24 is @xmath25 with probability @xmath37 independently of the other pairs of vertices but possibly with dependence across the modalities .",

    "we will also describe next in section  [ b ] how the adjacency - spectral partitioning procedure of that section can be modified for this more complicated scenario so that theorem [ a ] will still hold for it .",
    "the adjacency - spectral partitioning procedure that we work with is given as follows :    first , take the realized adjacency matrix @xmath29 , and compute a singular value decomposition @xmath44 ( \\sigma \\oplus \\sigma_r ) [ v|v_r]^t$ ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are such that @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] are each real - orthogonal matrices , and @xmath51 is a diagonal matrix with its diagonals non - increasingly ordered @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the diagonal matrix whose diagonals are the nonnegative square roots of the respective diagonals  of  @xmath54 , and then compute @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then , cluster the rows of @xmath57 or @xmath58 or @xmath59 $ ] into at most @xmath1 clusters using the minimum least squares criterion , as follows : if it is known that the rows of @xmath4 are pairwise not equal , then compute @xmath60 which minimizes @xmath61 over all matrices @xmath62 such that there are at most @xmath1 distinct - valued rows in  @xmath63 , otherwise , if it is known that the columns of @xmath4 are pairwise not equal , then compute @xmath60 which minimizes @xmath64 over all matrices @xmath62 such that there are at most @xmath1 distinct - valued rows in @xmath63 , otherwise compute @xmath65 which minimizes @xmath66 \\|_f$ ] over all matrices @xmath67 such that there are at most @xmath1 distinct - valued rows in @xmath63 .",
    "( although our analysis will assume the use of this minimum least squares criterion , note that popular clustering algorithms such as @xmath1-means will also ( empirically ) produce good results for our inferential task of block assignment . )",
    "the clusters obtained are estimates for the true blocks ; i.e.  define the block assignment function @xmath68 such that the inverse images @xmath69 partition the rows of @xmath70 ( by index ) so that rows in each part are equal - valued .",
    "this concludes  the  procedure .    in the more complicated scenario of multiple modalities of communication ,",
    "carry out the above procedure in the same way , mutatis mutandis : for each modality @xmath71 , compute the singular value decomposition @xmath72 ( \\sigma^{(s ) } \\oplus \\sigma_r^{(s ) } ) [ v^{(s)}|v^{(s)}_r]^t$ ] for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 such that @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] are each real - orthogonal matrices and @xmath79 is a diagonal matrix with its diagonals non - increasingly ordered , then define @xmath80 and @xmath81 and then , according as the rows of all @xmath82 are known to be distinct - valued , the columns of @xmath82 are known to be distinct - valued , or neither , compute @xmath70 which minimizes @xmath83 \\|_f$ ] or @xmath84 \\|_f$ ] or @xmath85 \\|_f$ ] such that there are at most @xmath1 distinct - valued rows in @xmath63 , and then define @xmath86 as the partition of the vertices into @xmath1 blocks according to equal - valued corresponding rows in @xmath70 .",
    "we consider a sequence of realizations of the stochastic block model given in section [ c ] for successive values @xmath2 with all stochastic block model parameters being fixed . in this article ,",
    "an event will be said to hold _ almost always _ if almost surely the event occurs for all but a finite number of @xmath0 .",

    "[ a ] with the adjacency - spectral partitioning procedure of section [ b ] , for any fixed @xmath87 , the number of misassignments @xmath33 is almost always less than @xmath88 .",
    "theorem [ a ] holds for all of the scenarios we described in section [ c ] ; whether the edges are directed or undirected , whether there is one modality of communication or multiple modalities",
    ". it also does nt matter if for each successive @xmath0 the partition function and adjacencies are re - realized for all vertices or if instead they are carried over from previous @xmath0 s realization with just one new vertex randomly assigned to a block and just this vertex s adjacencies to the previous vertices being newly realized .",
    "( note that if the partition function and adjacencies are re - realized for all vertices for successive @xmath0 then when we invoke the strong law of large numbers we will be using the version of the law in @xcite . )    in sussman et al .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that if @xmath89 rank@xmath4 then the number of misassignments of the adjacency spectral procedure in section [ b ] is almost always less than a constant times @xmath90 ( where the constant is a function of the model parameters ) .",
    "indeed , both @xmath90 and @xmath88 , when divided by the number of vertices @xmath0 , converge to zero , and in that sense we can now say that whether rank@xmath4 is known or if it is overestimated then either way the number of misassignments of spectral - adjacency partitioning is negligible . this is a useful robustness result .",

    "we first emphasize that knowing the values of these constants @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 which we are about to identify and knowing the values of the latent vectors which we are about to define are not at all needed to actually * perform * the adjacency - spectral clustering procedure of section [ b ] , nor is any such knowledge needed in order to invoke and * use * the consistency result theorem [ a ] .",

    "there does nt currently seem to be a clear answer ; for some choices of stochastic block model parameters it seems empirically that the adjacency matrix gives fewer misassignments than the laplacian , and for other choices of parameters the laplacian seems to be better .",
    "a determination of exact criterion ( on the stochastic block model parameters ) for which the adjacency matrix is better than the laplacian and vice versa deserves attention in future work .",

    "<S> for random graphs distributed according to a stochastic block model , we consider the inferential task of partioning vertices into blocks using spectral techniques . </S>",
    "<S> spectral partioning using the normalized laplacian and the adjacency matrix have both been shown to be consistent as the number of vertices tend to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , both procedures require that the number of blocks and the rank of the communication probability matrix are known , even as the rest of the parameters may be unknown . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we prove that the ( suitably modified ) adjacency - spectral partitioning procedure , requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix , is consistent . indeed , this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis - specification ; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty , but the procedure is still consistent . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we extend this procedure to the setting where adjacencies may have multiple modalities and we allow for either directed or undirected graphs . </S>"
