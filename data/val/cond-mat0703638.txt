    "( [ l4]b ) . the incomplete transfer and occupation",
    "are restricted due to unequal effective rabi frequencies in two paths .",
    "once the external field optimizes the efficiency of one path , the efficiency of the other is not optimal .    the formulae in eq .",
    "( [ lambdaeqn ] ) clearly show that the probability @xmath192 has a maximum value at @xmath193 with an odd integer @xmath194 and a minimum value at @xmath195 with an even integer @xmath196 . at these extreme points",
    "we have the ratio @xmath197 ^ 2/4(r_{+}^{12})^2(r_{-}^{13})^2 $ ] , which indicates the optimal transfer at @xmath198 . away from this ratio",
    ", the transfer efficiency will decrease . in fig .",
    "( [ l4]b ) , transition among a doublet of @xmath199 and 2.5 and an auxiliary level of @xmath200 at @xmath201 is considered . in this case , there is only 45@xmath202 occupation on @xmath158 for @xmath203 0.38 .",
    "if the effective rabi frequencies of the paths @xmath204 and @xmath205 are the same , the optimal control of electron dynamics is feasible . to show this",
    ", we calculate the time - dependent occupation probability on each states . in the inset , it is clear that at extreme times , occupation on @xmath158 based on a pseudo @xmath188 transition process has a maximum value .",
    "meanwhile , states @xmath166 and @xmath157 are empty left .",
    "moreover , we also investigate the transition process stimulated by chirped pulse irradiation . by setting @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208",
    ", we obtain a long - time occupation of the final state , obeying estimation of landau - zener s formula .",
    "the result is shown by dash - dotted line in the inset .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) a sketch of the @xmath188type scheme .",
    "states here are all with effective up - spin orientations .",
    "an electron initially occupies state @xmath157 can be optically pumped to an outer - ring state @xmath158 mediated by state @xmath166 .",
    "( b ) the population probabilities among three levels .",
    "the long - time occupation of an excited state is feasible by applying an short and intense pulse . in the inset",
    "we show the optimal transfer is feasible provided that there is common rabi frequency in the two paths .",
    "( c ) an alternative output signal can be obtained under successive pulse stimulations.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    within proper controls of the pulse width @xmath176 against the typical level spacings and the dephasing time of electrons , it is easy to manipulate electronic states in @xmath188scheme system by successive application of pulses.@xcite using the same parameters as in fig .",
    "( [ l4]b ) , we simulate the pulse - induced periodic oscillations . here the gaussian pulse duration @xmath209 and the pulse interval is about @xmath210 .",
    "different from the sinusoidal ros , an alternative square wave is shown in fig .",
    "( [ l4]c ) . apparently , the level occupation time in both inner and outer ring is prolonged .",
    "moreover , since the duration of the pulse is properly tuned , it can be expected that time evolution of the occupation should be complete in the pseudo @xmath188 transition process .",
    "otherwise , under - excitation or over - excitation takes place corresponding to the duration being too short or too long , respectively .",
    "level occupation will never be or just be transiently complete .",
    "the well control of pulse delay time also shows the flexibility of manipulations on quantum states .",
    "in this work we have studied magnetic - optical transitions in a semiconductor double ring in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling and the magnetic flux .",
    "first , based on accurate numerical calculations we obtain soi - accompanied ab energy spectra and corresponding eigenstates .",
    "the presence of the soi has important influences on the occurrence of level crossings showing the evidence both for the periodic orbital motion and spin flips .",
    "in addition , there are anti - crossing levels playing the role of the magnetic - resonant extraditions of electrons between inner and outer rings . in high energy regime ,",
    "occurrence of avoided crossings indicates a chaotic signature in its classical analogy . to facilitate the peculiar features of the double - ring system we have designed some interesting dynamic processes such that the system can be easily explored experimentally in the near future .",
    "we have studied the temporal evolution processes in a two - level and two three - level models .",
    "the interaction between external fields and the electron results in the successive stimulating absorption and emission of a photon and turn out as the effective rabi oscillators .",
    "in the two - level model , we demonstrate an alternative manipulation of electrons transiting between two rings . in cascade scheme ,",
    "aperiodic and incomplete population transfer is revealed under the sinusoidal field excitations . by appropriate tuning soi strength ,",
    "the gap between avoided crossing levels can be reduced such that the rectified output signals are measurable .",
    "moreover , by short pulse excitations we also demonstrate the possibility on optimal control of selective and direct signals . in this work , only one lader transition is demonstrated , which however can be extended to multi - ladder transitions following the same principle .",
    "finally , we have explored the photon - assisted tunneling in the @xmath188type model .",
    "in addition to generation of ros also we give the criterion of the most efficient transfer via the mediated - indirect - tunneling paths .",
    "further , by successive pulse irradiations the well control on pulse delay results in the time prolongation on state populations . we should also emphasize that in the @xmath188type scheme the minimization of the intermediate - level population is achieved which is an important and practical strategy in device realization .",
    "the presence of soi allows the manipulation of spin degree of freedom and it is timely to examine the spin - dependent optical response . since , similar features could be found in double - dot systems , the above theoretical results in a double ring might shed light on the future experimental findings in these burgeoning quantum systems . while there are few works on optically induced and soi driven spin dynamics in quantum systems,@xcite we believe that the theoretical and experimental works of related spin read - out information by optical pumping in ring - like systems could be carried out in the near future .",
