    "ultracold atomic fermi gases provide unique opportunities to investigate the crossover from the bardeen - cooper - shrieffer ( bcs ) type superfluids to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of tightly bound molecules@xcite in a unified manner@xcite .",
    "one of the key ingredients to achieve this bcs - bec crossover in fermi gases is a feshbach resonance@xcite , which allows one to tune the pairing interaction from the weak - coupling bcs limit to the strong coupling bec limit@xcite .",
    "since the bcs - bec crossover is a fundamental many - body problem , it has recently attracted much attention , not only in cold atom physics , but also in various research fields , such as condensed matter physics and high energy physics . in particular , this system is expected to be helpful for further understanding of high-@xmath1 cuprates , which has been one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics@xcite .    in the under - doped regime of high-@xmath1 cuprates , the so - called pseudogap phenomenon has been extensively studied@xcite . in this phenomenon ,",
    "the single - particle density of states ( dos ) in the normal state exhibits a dip structure around the fermi energy .",
    "the temperature at which the pseudogap appears is referred to as the pseudogap temperature @xmath2 , which is higher than the superconducting phase transition temperature @xmath1 . in the region between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ,",

    "however , because of the complexity of high-@xmath1 cuprates , other scenarios have been also discussed , such as antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite and a hidden order@xcite .",
    "thus , a simple system only having strong pairing fluctuations would be helpful to confirm whether or not preformed pairs are responsible for the pseudogap formation in high-@xmath1 cuprates .    in this regard",
    ", the cold fermi gas system meets this demand .",
    "this system is much cleaner and simpler than high-@xmath1 cuprates , and the pairing mechanism associated with a feshbach resonance has been well understood .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is dominated by strong pairing fluctuations , so that one can focus on how they affect physical quantities .",
    "indeed , effects of pairing fluctuations on single - particle spectral weight have been theoretically studied by many researchers@xcite .",
    "they clarified that pairing fluctuations lead to a bcs - type double peak structure in the spectral weight above @xmath1 , which is a signature of pseudogap phenomenon .",
    "they also found that the two peaks in the spectral weight merge into a single peak at high temperatures . in ref .",

    "a photoemission - type experiment has recently become possible in cold atom physics@xcite , we can now examine strong - coupling effects on single - particle excitations within the current experimental technology .",
    "although cold fermi gases are not exactly the same as high-@xmath1 cuprates ( e.g. , pairing symmetry ) , the study of pseudogap phenomenon in cold fermi gases is expected to be useful for further understanding of the underdoped regime of high-@xmath1 cuprates .    in this paper",

    "in addition , preformed pairs also induce the particle - hole coupling , which gives the double peak structure in @xmath52 . between the two effects associated with pair formation , while @xmath3 is directly related to the latter by definition , the former is crucial for @xmath2 : in the bcs regime , since the peak - to - peak energy in @xmath52 is small , the double - peak pseudogap structure is easily smeared out by the lifetime effect , namely , the broadening of two peaks . on the other hand , dos around @xmath68 is suppressed , when the height of quasiparticle peak at @xmath167 is lowered by the broadening effect . as a result , one obtains @xmath4 in the bcs regime , and one may use @xmath2 as the characteristic temperature where preformed pairs are formed .",
    "the double peak structure can be clearly seen in @xmath52 in the crossover - bec regime , because the peak - to - peak energy becomes larger than the peak widths . however , as discussed previously , the lower peak becomes very broad and the weight becomes small in the bec regime , reflecting that the system is close to a gas of two - body bound molecules .",
    "thus , one can not see the dip structure in dos even when the particle - hole coupling induce the double peak structure in @xmath115 below @xmath3 .",
    "as one further decreases the temperature , the lower peak in @xmath52 shrinks and the peak height increases , because the system approaches the superfluid phase .",
    "this clearly enhances the intensity of dos in the negative energy region , leading to the dip structure below @xmath168 .",
    "the different behaviors of two pseudogap temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 imply that the pseudogap region may depend on what we measure .",
    "when we consider a quantity where dos is crucial , @xmath2 would give the boundary between the pseudogap region and normal fermi gas regime .",
    "on the other hand , when we consider a quantity dominated by the spectral weight , @xmath3 would be observed as the boundary between the two regions .",
    "while the specific heat is an example of the former quantity , the recent photoemission - type experiment@xcite is considered to be a latter example .",
    "we note that , when the temperature is lower than the binding energy @xmath169 of a two - body bound molecule in the bec regime , thermal dissociation of molecules is suppressed . in this sense",
    ", one may regard this regime as a molecular bose gas , rather than a ( strongly - correlated ) fermi gas . including this",
    ", we obtain the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phdgm ] . in this figure , the pseudogap regime is the region surrounded by @xmath2 or @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath65 .",
    "we briefly note that except for @xmath1 , other temperatures @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath170 , are all crossover temperatures without accompanied by any phase transition .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the pseudogap behaviors of an ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover above @xmath1 .",
    "we have calculated the single - particle density of states ( dos ) , as well as the single - particle spectral weight , including pair fluctuations within the framework of @xmath0-matrix approximation .",
    "we showed how the pseudogap structure appears / disappears in dos above @xmath1 in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "starting from the weak - coupling bcs regime , while the pseudogap in dos becomes remarkable near the unitarity limit , it continuously changes into a fully gapped dos in the bec regime .",
    "we determined the pseudogap temperature @xmath2 as the temperature when the dip structure in dos disappears .",
    "we also introduced another pseudogap temperature @xmath3 at which the double peak structure in the spectral weight vanishes .",
    "we showed that , although both the dip structures in dos and the double peak structure in the spectral weight originate from pairing fluctuations , their values are very different from each other in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "while one finds @xmath4 in the bcs side ( @xmath171 ) , @xmath3 becomes much higher than @xmath172 in the bec side ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "this means that the pseudogap region may depend on the physical quantities which we measure .",
    "in particular , since the recent photoemission - type experiment@xcite is related to the spectral weight , one expects that @xmath3 would work as the pseudogap temperature in this experiment . including @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we determined the pseudogap region in the bcs - bec phase diagram with respect to temperature and the strength of pairing interaction . since the pseudogap effects are crucial in understanding strong - coupling fermi superfluids , our results would be useful in the search for the pseudogap region in the bcs - bec crossover regime of ultracold fermi gases .",
