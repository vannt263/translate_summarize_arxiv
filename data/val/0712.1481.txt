    "fr cnc is a by dra type star , showing its light variations ( 017 ) , caused , as assumed , by the presence of star - spots and axial rotation @xcite .",
    "very recently golovin , a. , pavlenko , e. , kuznyetsova , yu . and krushevska , v. @xcite detected the first ever - observed large optical flare ( 102 in b - band , 049 - v - band , 021 - r - band , 014 - i - band ) at crao .",
    "fr cnc has unusually short ( for such class of objects ) rotational period of 0.@xmath58267 . as it was shown in @xcite , short rotational period",
    "allow to expect large flare activity in the star .    in the aim to detect other flares in this object",
    ", we decided to continue photometrical monitoring of fr cnc .",
    "observations were carried out by the authors at crao during 4 nights on november , 2006 with the help of 38-cm cassegrain telescope and sbig st-9 ccd camera , as well as in terskol observatory during 7 nights in march , 2007 using 0.29-m telescope and apogee-47 alta ccd camera ( see table 1 for log of observations ) .",
    "all observations were done in b - band as far as the flare amplitude is increasing with decreasing of the wavelength .",
    "the duration of each observational run varies from 2 to 7 hours .",
    "calibration process of the obtained frames , comparison and check stars are remain the same as described in @xcite .",
    "the obtained lightcurve during the course of fr cnc monitoring in march , 2007 , folded with fr cnc rotational period of 0.8267 days , is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "as it is clearly seen , one - humped 017 variations with the rotational period are clearly distinguishable , while no flares were detected that could imply that flares is a rare event for fr cnc and makes this object even more interesting for follow - up observations . taking into account large amplitude of the flares in short wavelengths ,",
    "b - band would be recommended , nevertheless , multicolour ccd photometry is highly valuable as well .",
