    "it is commonly recognized that realization of full potential of organic electronics is closely related on the ability to accurately analyze and predict the electronic properties of the various interfaces that play a role in the devices.@xcite such concept is particularly evident in the case of organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) , whose performances are decisively affected by local interactions of the organic semiconductor at its interface with gate dielectric@xcite and air.@xcite .    the important phenomenon of voltage threshold shift during continuous gate bias ( also known as `` bias stress effect '' ) can be considered a representative example of the influence exerted on ofets charge transport properties by the organic semiconductor / gate dielectric interplay.@xcite bias stress effect is commonly attributed to charge trapping occurring in the semiconductor / dielectric transitional region and the issue of actual location ( either semiconductor or gate dielectric ) of the fixed charges has remained elusive for some time,@xcite until the possibility to probe the trapped charge in a direct manner has been demonstrated by semiconductor removal through scotch - tape exfoliation followed by scanning kelvin probe microscopy analysis of the exposed dielectric layer.@xcite even if these analysis are very convincing and important , they involve some technical complications ( e.g. films need to be mechanically robust to allow a complete exfoliation , ambient light can de - trap the charge ) and , in particular , the analysis implies the device destruction .",
    "ultimately , such complications can be avoided only by developing a non - contact and spatially - selective probing of the buried interface .",
    "optical analysis can indeed provide a direct and contact - free probing of electronic processes,@xcite but it is also to be noted that many of the most common optical spectroscopy techniques are based on linear matter - radiation interaction processes ( such as absorption , reflection , fluorescence , etc . ) taking place in the whole bulk of the medium : as a consequence , they are not intrinsically spatially - selective .",
    "exploitation of optical processes carrying an intrinsic sensitivity to the physical state of surfaces and/or interfaces is instead desirable : one example of such processes is represented by optical second harmonic generation ( shg ) , consisting in the generation of an electromagnetic wave of frequency 2@xmath1 ( `` second - harmonic '' or sh wave ) caused by the interaction between a material medium and a laser beam ( `` fundamental beam '' ) of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , symmetry considerations allow to demonstrate that such process can not take place in material regions where inversion symmetry holds.@xcite therefore , shg analysis is intrinsically spatially - selective , as it allows probing electronic properties related only to regions where the inversion symmetry is broken by material discontinuities ( surfaces , interfaces ) or by the presence of local field having a well - defined direction .    as being an optical spectroscopy technique , shg analysis allows to exploit peculiarities such as access to interfaces , absence of physical contacts , possibility to study dynamic processes by time - resolved detection.@xcite also thanks to such peculiarities , shg spectroscopy has been successfully employed in last years in the field of organic field - effect transistors for investigations on carrier mobility,@xcite channel formation,@xcite trap states@xcite and charge transfer at heterostructures.@xcite    driven by such considerations , we report about the first shg analysis - assisted by photoluminescence ( pl ) investigations - devoted to the study of interfacial charge trapping and internal built - in electric field formation in n , n-bis(n - octyl)-(1,7&1,6)-dicyanoperylene-3,4:9,10- bisdicarboximide ( pdi8-cn@xmath0 ) films grown on silicon dioxide ( sio@xmath0 ) .",
    "pdi8-cn@xmath0 is a perylene diimide derivative considered to be one of the most promising materials for realization of stable n - channel ofets@xcite and complementary circuits,@xcite also yielding high - performance devices by sublimation or from solution methods.@xcite recent investigations allowed to establish that the molecular packing in pdi8-cn@xmath0 films is characterized by planar centrosymmetric perylene cores stacked cofacially , with  interactions almost perpendicular to the substrate surface.@xcite thus , shg spectroscopy appears to be particularly suited to the study of surface / interface processes in pdi8-cn@xmath0 considering its centrosymmetry and its in - plane charge delocalization.@xcite    analyzing a set of variable thickness pdi8-cn@xmath0 thin films by polarization - resolved shg ( pr - shg ) and extracting the amplitude of @xmath2 second - order dielectric susceptibility tensor elements , a finite three - dimensional pdi8-cn@xmath0 region where the spatial distribution of charge carriers lacks inversion symmetry has been evidenced .",
    "a model to interpret this finding has been developed on the basis of a debye - huckel charge screening mechanism triggered by charges localized in the sio@xmath0 dielectric layer .",
    "such picture , confirmed by photoluminescence findings , is used here to develop an expression of electric field - induced shg ( efishg ) susceptibility associated to the screening field , allowing extracting an effective debye length for the charge distribution induced in the semiconductor by the fixed charge located in the gate dielectric .",
    "the work is organized as follows : the experimental methods and details are described in section 2 ; section 3 is devoted to the experimental results , involving pr - shg and excitation - resolved photoluminescence ( ple ) analysis ; in section 4 the interpretation model developed to elucidate the experimental results is described , followed by a discussion on pl - ple results and on other literature findings .",
    "main conclusions are finally drawn in section 5 .",
    "experimental investigation in the present work was carried out on a set of five different thickness pdi8-cn@xmath0 thin films deposited on sio@xmath0 , indicated hereafter as s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 and having a thickness ( @xmath3 ) of 6 nm , 10 nm , 20 nm , 42 nm and 70 nm respectively .",

    "the polarization angle @xmath11 of the linearly - polarized laser beam was varied through a 1064 nm half - wave retardation plate mounted on computer - controlled motorized rotation stage .",
    "sharp cut - off optical filters were used to block fundamental beam reflected by the sample and the undesired residual sh wave generated in the various optical elements composing the setup .",

    "it can be recognized that the centre of mass of the emission profile does not coincide with the peak position , suggesting therefore the presence of more than a single pl band .",

    "the experiments were performed by detecting the optical intensity of the reflected p - polarized ( i.e. parallel to the plane of incidence @xmath22 in fig .",
    "3 ) sh wave as a function of the polarization angle @xmath11 .",
    "the general purpose of the pr - shg approach is to extract from experimental data the individual shg susceptibilities ( i.e. tensor elements of the @xmath24 tensor that drives the shg process ) , as they represent the physical quantities that carry information on both surface properties and electric field - induced effects . in the case of isotropic media , @xmath24 tensor",
    "is composed by only three independent non - null elements , namely @xmath25 , @xmath2 and @xmath26 . using the axis representation shown in fig .",
    "3 , the polar pattern of p - polarized shg intensity @xmath27 vs. @xmath11 ( indicated also as `` @xmath11p plot '' ) can be directly related to the non - null susceptibility elements as follows:@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 : therefore , the @xmath2 coefficient can be singled out through a best - fit of @xmath11p plots , while the term a has a more complicated expression , combining all the susceptibility elements with trigonometric function of the angle of incidence.@xcite    in fig .",
    "4 ( upper panel ) the experimental @xmath11p plots are reported for some of the investigated samples ( to improve the readability of the graph the @xmath11p curve of the s3 sample is omitted ) .",
    "all of the investigated pdi8-cn@xmath0 films indeed exhibited the same @xmath11p polar pattern , in accordance with eq.[eq:1 ] and differing only in actual values of the shg intensity ( and , thus , in actual values of the best - fit coefficients ) .",
    "in other words , all investigated pdi8-cn@xmath0 films exhibited an shg polar pattern representative of an average isotropic symmetry extended over the size of the optical interaction spot .",
    "observation of such planar isotropy was indeed predictable , after considering that the optical excitation probes a surface area including a very high number of elongated domains with random in - plane orientation .",
    "as a rough estimation , we can take the in - plane correlation length @xmath30 as a characteristic average size of an ordered domain : considering typical @xmath30 values ranging in pdi8-cn@xmath0 from about 80 to 150 nm,@xcite an estimated number of 10@xmath31 randomly - oriented domains are probed on average in our measurements , thus smoothing out local in - plane anisotropy of individual domains .",

    "the corresponding best - fitting values for @xmath33susceptibility coefficient are plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 as a function of pdi8-cn@xmath0 films thickness .",
    "it can be seen that the shg susceptibilities exhibit a peculiar behavior , characterized by a thickness dependence which is marked for smaller film thicknesses and fades into a plateau at larger film thicknesses . even at this pre - analysis stage",
    ", it can thus be anticipated that the results strongly suggest that the observed nonlinear response can not be assigned to interface - localized processes only , which are not expected to depend on film thickness .",
    "as previously mentioned , the observed dependence of pdi8-cn@xmath0 shg intensities and susceptibilities on sample thickness suggests that interfacial - related optical nonlinearity is not the sole contribution to the second harmonic signal .",
    "indeed , the behavior represented in the bottom panel of fig 4 indicates that the `` shg - active '' region is not limited to only one or two molecular layers as in `` standard '' surface / interface - related shg , but indeed extends for several nanometers , defining a finite three - dimensional volume corresponding to a semiconductor thickness above which the shg signal saturates .",
    "actually , inversion symmetry in centrosymmetric semiconductors can be broken not only by material discontinuities - leading to the properly called surface / interface shg - but also by local fields having a well - defined direction , leading in this case to the electric field - induced shg ( efishg ) phenomenon .",
    "it is worth underlining that the two situations involve different shg - active regions , namely a quasi - two dimensional transitional region in the former case and a three - dimensional region ( in which local electrostatic fields are present ) in efishg .    in this section",
    "we show that the observed features can be actually interpreted in terms of efishg induced by a non - uniform charge distribution related to the presence of a charged interfacial layer . to this aim , we start by developing the nonlinear susceptibility term associated to electric field - induced shg phenomenon . the latter is a third - order phenomenon , driven by the @xmath34 susceptibility tensor:@xcite as being an odd - order term , @xmath34 is not restricted by inversion symmetry considerations and is therefore non - vanishing in the bulk of centrosymmetric media .",
    "the efishg term arises from the local presence of a static electric field ( indicated by @xmath35 ) giving rise to a nonlinear polarization whose expression ( using tensor notation ) is @xcite @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is assumed to be directed along the normal to material surface due to the isotropy of the system in the ( xy ) plane .",
    "the previous expression clearly indicates that the efishg polarization represents an additional shg contribution , originating from the presence of a @xmath38 term that breaks the symmetry under inversion of the z - axis .    for the present work",
    ", we derived the expression of the total effective shg susceptibility in presence of both interfacial and electric field - induced shg by using the green function formalism developed by sipe for surface optics.@xcite the details for the calculation of the effective @xmath2 susceptibility ( which is the quantity determined though the experimental @xmath11p polar plots ) for the case of an isotropic film are reported in appendix , where the following expression is demonstrated : @xmath39 where @xmath3 is the semiconductor thickness , @xmath40 represents the interfacial second - order nonlinear susceptibility and @xmath41 is the @xmath42 element of @xmath43 tensor element ( i.e. one of the three non - null independent tensor elements of @xmath44 tensor characterizing an isotropic medium , see appendix for the exact definition ) .",

    "finally , @xmath53,where @xmath54 is the extinction coefficient of pdi8-cn@xmath0 at sh wavelength .    on the basis of the above expression",
    ", we show here that the peculiar behaviour obtained for shg susceptibility @xmath55 in sio@xmath0/pdi8-cn@xmath0 systems can be interpreted as resulting from the presence of a net charge in sio@xmath0 gate dielectric , localized about its interface with the organic semiconductor . to this aim , it is to be underlined that the organic molecules are in the neutral state in shg experiments : as a consequence , accumulation of localized charges has to be compensated by redistribution of opposite charge , screening out the local charge and guaranteeing the overall charge neutrality of the organic semiconductor .",
    "the built - in electrostatic field @xmath56 induced by the redistributed charge can thus give rise to an efishg term in the total shg response , according to eq.([eq:2 ] ) and eq.([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "the spatial profile @xmath57 of the electrostatic field is of course ruled by the poisson equation @xmath58 , where @xmath59 indicates the density of redistributed charge in the organic semiconductor . in the general case",
    ", the latter has to be solved numerically@xcite due to its intrinsic non - linear nature ( i.e. the charge density itself depends on the local value of electrostatic potential @xmath60 ) .",

    "expression for the electric field takes into account the main features observed for shg susceptibilities of pdi8-cn@xmath0 . in fact , using eqs.([eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) the field - dependent quantity @xmath45 becomes :    @xmath67 dz } \\label{eq:5}\\ ] ]    it is easily seen that the modulus of eq.([eq:5 ] ) describes a thickness - dependent quantity that increases for @xmath68 , followed by saturation and attenuation as film thickness approaches the attenuation length @xmath69 , thus reproducing the behavior of experimentally determined quantity .    in the case",
    "where the built - in electric field extends up to a debye length @xmath62 much less than the shg coherence length @xmath70 , a first - order taylor approximation ( @xmath71 \\cong 1 $ ] ) leads to the following simple expression : @xmath72 \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] while the imaginary part of @xmath45 has to be considered for the @xmath73 calculation in the more general case of a debye length not negligible compared to the coherence length @xmath70 .",

    "is found to be about 3% , a result that can be considered satisfactory within the experimental uncertainties .",

    "interesting considerations can be expounded from pl+ple findings previously reported .",
    "even if no specific references are available to elucidate the nature of states contributing to pl emission in pdi8-cn@xmath0 , it is worth citing a recent in - situ pl analysis performed on molecular films of perylene cores.@xcite in this work , authors evidenced the different spectral contributions originating from excimers and from defects states at room temperature , with the former contributing to a pl peak significantly red - shifted ( @xmath85 540 mev ) with respect to the 0 - 0 monomer transition.@xcite these results are very close to the ones here reported for pdi8-cn@xmath0 , whose pl also can be decomposed as a superposition of two contributes , one approximately peaked at @xmath86=1.76 ev ( red dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 ) and another at about @xmath87=1.90 ev ( blue dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 ) . it is to be noted that the energy distance between @xmath86 and the first absorption transition ( @xmath19 ) is @xmath88 520 mev , almost equal to the result reported by chen and richardson.@xcite it is also to be underlined that the second emission band occurs at photon energies very close to the onset of optical absorption @xmath18 evidenced by the ple spectra . on these basis",
    ", the pl components peaked at energies @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be reasonably assigned to excimer emission and below - bandgap defective states , similarly to ref.49 .",

    "it is a key point that the above described occupation of near band - edge states implies a pinning of the fermi level close to the lumo edge and , as a consequence , a non - negligible occupation of lumo states at finite temperature .",
    "this supports the presence of mobile electrons able to spatially redistribute themselves in as - grown pdi8-cn@xmath0 films .",
    "other recent literature works also support this latter conclusion .",
    "a very direct evidence of lumo occupation was obtained by recent ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy investigations evidencing a fermi level positioned very close to the lumo edge in pdi8-cn@xmath0 films.@xcite furthermore , the presence of mobile bulk electrons in pdi8-cn@xmath0 thin - film transistors using non - passivated sio@xmath0 layers as gate dielectric was also evidenced in ref .",

    "the experimental results pointed out a finite three - dimensional `` shg - active '' semiconductor region in which spatial distribution of charge carriers lacked inversion symmetry , suggesting that purely - interfacial shg did not represent the only contribution to the total sh intensity .",
    "in particular , we showed that the experimental findings could be modeled in terms of electric field - induced shg , resulting from the presence of a net charge lying in the sio@xmath0 gate dielectric and inducing a non - uniform charge distribution in bulk pdi8-cn@xmath0 , according to a debye - like charge screening mechanism .",

    "44 , the output sh electric field @xmath97 generated by a polarization @xmath98 and radiated in reflection geometry is given by :      we fix the origin of z axis ( @xmath100 ) at sio@xmath0/pdi8-cn@xmath0 buried interface , so that the amplitude of the output field is obtained by using @xmath101 . using the expression of electric field - induced polarization @xmath102",
    "( see also the main text ) and eq.([eq : a1 ] ) , one obtains :      where the fundamental and sh fields are expressed as @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 = @xmath106 represent the wave - vector component perpendicular to sample surface of the i - th field ( @xmath50 for the fundamental field , @xmath51 for the sh field ) and @xmath107 indicates the pdi8-cn@xmath0 complex refractive index .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath108 can be safely considered as a real quantity ( as negligible optical absorption occurs in pdi8-cn@xmath0 at the fundamental wavelength @xmath10=1064 nm ) , while absorption is instead not negligible at sh wavelength @xmath12 = 532 nm and a finite imaginary part @xmath54 in the complex refractive index @xmath109 has to be considered .",
    "eq.([eq : a2 ] ) can therefore be rewritten as : @xmath110 where @xmath111}dz\\ ] ] and where @xmath112 @xmath113 are the optical attenuation length and the coherence length for reflected sh wave , respectively .        where the first member represents the i - th component of the electric field - induced sh wave and where the standard einstein convention of summing over repeated indexes is used .",
    "a relation similar to ( [ eq : a4 ] ) can of course be given for the interface sh wave :      noting that in this latter case no integration over the z coordinate occurs , due to the local nature of the interfacial susceptibility .",
    "the total sh signal can thus be conveniently expressed as proportional to @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "being 3-rd rank tensors , both @xmath118 and the contracted @xmath119 tensor ( with forth index fixed to `` z '' ) that appear in the previous expressions are described , in principle , by up to @xmath120 tensor elements .",
    "however , symmetry considerations can reduce significantly this number .",
    "in particular , in the case we are considering ( @xmath121 symmetry ) both tensors are described by only three non - null independent elements , namely @xmath2 , @xmath26 and @xmath25 for the interfacial second - order susceptibility tensor and @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the @xmath43 tensor ( the superscript `` ( 3 ) '' for the @xmath43 tensor elements has been omitted for the sake of brevity ) . from symmetry consideration",
    "the following equalities can be obtained:@xcite      the sh wave components can now be developed from eq.([eq : a4 ] ) and eq.([eq : a5 ] ) using the above listed non - null independent susceptibility elements .",
    "after calculation , the following expressions are obtained :        @xmath128 \\cdot \\left [ { \\chi _ { zxx}^{(i ) } + { \\gamma _ 3}{e^ { - d/\\lambda } } f(d ) } \\right ] + \\\\ & + { \\left ( { e_z^\\omega } \\right)^2 } \\cdot \\left [ { \\chi _ { zzz}^{(i ) } + \\gamma { e^ { - d/\\lambda } } f(d ) } \\right ] \\end{split } \\label{eq : a8}\\ ] ]        as a final check , it can be seen that in the s - in / p - out configuration ( @xmath131 in the @xmath11p plots , corresponding to @xmath132 ) the equalities @xmath133 and @xmath134 are obtained by means of eqs.([eq : a6]),([eq : a6 ] ) and ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the p - polarized sh signal measured at @xmath11=0 input polarization @xmath135 is proportional to the square modulus of @xmath2 , as also prescribed by eq .",
