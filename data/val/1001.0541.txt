    "perturbations of black holes decay first with complex frequencies , known as the quasinormal modes of of the black hole , taken over at late times by the tails of the perturbation field decaying as power",
    " laws of time .",
    "the decay rate of the late  time tails in the spacetime of spinning black holes has been the subject of much debate and some confusion .",
    "much of the debate in the literature was focused on the late  time decay rate of an initially pure azimuthal hexadecapole ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) scalar field perturbation .",
    "all authors agree that at late times the field is dominated by its monopole moment , and that the decay rate would be according to an inverse power of time , but different claims were made as to the value of the power  law exponent .",
    "specifically , there were claims for decay rate along fixed boyer ",
    "lindquist @xmath10 according to @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , and even @xmath13 @xcite .    in the last couple of years the behavior of the power ",
    "law tails has been clarified in a number of papers @xcite ( and the reader is referred to the detail therein ) , yet there are some remaining interesting detail waiting to be unveiled . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the disagreement between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 behaviors can be attributed to the use of different initial data sets ( see also @xcite ) , but not to the use of different slicing conditions as was suggested in @xcite .",
    "most importantly , boyer ",
    "lindquist slicing is not unique in terms of the resulting tails as had been argued , but rather belongs to an equivalency class of slicing conditions ( including also ingoing kerr slicing ) , all having similar tail structure properties .    for the evolution of scalar fields on a fixed background of a kerr black hole",
    ", the value of the power - law index , namely the exponent @xmath14 in the late - time decay rate @xmath3 , was given by hod @xcite as @xmath15 for even @xmath16 , n=@xmath17 for odd @xmath16 , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the multipole moment of the initial perturbation and @xmath2 is its azimuthal number .",
    "this expression for @xmath14 is rather complicated and notably depends on the azimuthal number @xmath2 .",
    "we argue that the added tacit requirement that it is the decay rate of the slowest decaying mode that is of usual interest masks the inherent simplicity of @xmath14 in the hod formula . specifically , we propose that the decay rate of the @xmath21 mode because of an initial @xmath20 mode is independent of @xmath2 , and is given by @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "notice that this proposal is consistent with hod s formula and with @xcite when they are applicable , and generalizes them also to all other cases .",
    "it is therefore a proposal for the general formula for the decay rate of any multipole moment of the tail because of any multipole moment of the initial data .",
    "it is striking that this more general formula is simpler than the formula for the decay rate of the least damped mode , that was the question that @xcite was addressing .",
    "we believe that this simple , general formula will provide insight into a more complete understanding of the tail phenomenon in spinning black hole spacetimes .",
    "our general formula allows up to address some questions left open also in the analysis of barack and ori @xcite .",
    "barack and ori studied analytically the late  time tails for generic families of initial data ( only assuming compactly supported outgoing initial pulses ) . instead of carrying the analysis in the frequency domain",
    "which turns out to be complicated on a kerr background because the frequency dependence of the spheroidal harmonics implies that separation of the two angular variables depends on the frequency barack and ori analyzed the evolution of perturbations in the time domain .",
    "barack and ori found the decay rate of the @xmath21 multipole given generic initial data , which they considered to be data in which all multipoles are present .",
    "in fact , because the smallest multipole contribution to the initial data turns out as we show below to dominate the decay rate of the @xmath21 multipole at late times , barack and ori found the decay rate of an even ( odd ) mode @xmath21 excites by the scalar field monopole ( dipole ) mode of the initial data . the barack  ori formula for the decay rate of the @xmath21 multipole has not been confirmed by numerical simulations , which we do below for the first time .",
    "our proposed formula also generalizes it to any initial multipole , not just the monopole ( or dipole ) as in @xcite .",
    "consider next the question of the decay rate of a certain multipole moment @xmath21 . in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    "the decay rate depends only the the value of @xmath21 , specifically it is @xmath3 where @xmath22 .",
    "most notably , the decay rate is independent of the history of the mode .",
    "this is no longer the case in the kerr spacetime : the decay rate of a multipole @xmath21 does depend on how that mode came into existence , specifically , it depends on both @xmath23 . in the schwarzschild case",
    "the dependence is only on @xmath21 because of the degeneracy @xmath24 and the absence of mode couplings (  spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the wave operator \" ) .",
    "therefore , in the schwarzschild case one may say that  a multipole is a multipole , \" and consequently its decay rate is intimately linked to its angular distribution and the associated symmetry group . specifically , in schwarzschild there is a one  to ",
    "one relation of the symmetry group of the mode in question and the mode s late  time decay rate , such that the symmetry determines the time evolution of the mode .",
    "previous studies of tail behavior in kerr have suggested that it is not correct to say in kerr that  a multipole is a multipole , \" although the authors are not aware of explicit statements in this regard .",
    "we bring here new evidence that that is indeed the case , and the tail decay rate has nothing to do with the symmetry group of the mode in question",
    ". this insight may be helpful in the understanding of cases where more than one channel contributes to a mode of a certain @xmath21 value , although each channel contributes so that the decay rate is different , in what might be construed as an apparent violation of the superposition principle .",
    "the realization that in kerr one may no longer correctly argue that  a multipole is a multipole \" completely resolves this apparent violation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : code ] we describe the numerical code and the type of initial data sets that we use .",
    "specifically , we describe the code development that was necessary in order to support our proposal for the tail decay - rate formula . in this paper",
    "we discuss three related questions : first , in section [ sec : generic ] we address the difference in the time evolution of late  time tails between generic and non  generic initial data sets .",
    "generic initial data sets were first considered by barack and ori @xcite , but their results have not been confronted with numerical simulations . in addition to verifying the results of @xcite",
    ", we also discuss the meaning of genericity of initial data sets .",
    "as we demonstrate , not any mixture of all multipole modes is in fact generic , and one needs to exclude mixtures that are the outcome of the evolution of non - generic initial data , although such mixtures exhibit similar properties to mixtures that represent _ bona fide _ generic data sets .",
    "then , in section [ sec : up ] , we consider an aspect of late  time tails that has not been studied before , specifically the decay rate of excited higher multipole modes , which we call  up \" excited modes , namely the case @xmath25 . the decay rate of  up \" excited modes generalized the barack  ori result in @xcite to some interesting cases : the case of non  generic initial data in which ( only ) the lowest dynamically allowed mode is not present , and the case in which only one multipole mode is present in the initial data .",

    "we next define the ` momentum ' @xmath33 of the field @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 , according to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the regular kerr spacetime ` tortoise ' coordinate defined by @xmath38 .",
    "our code is a 2 + 1d first  order code for the time evolution of modes @xmath2 of @xmath39 given two independent functions of two variables at @xmath40 as initial data , based on @xcite .",

    "order angular operators ) .",
    "the standard grid resolution we use is @xmath41 grid points in the radial direction , and @xmath42 angular grid points ( which we denote as @xmath43 ) , unless stated otherwise , taking the temporal step to be the largest step consistent with the courant condition .    in practice , we choose as initial data @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the radial function @xmath46 is chosen to be a gaussian @xmath47 $ ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the outer and inner boundaries are placed at @xmath50 , which allows us to integrate to @xmath51 at @xmath52 without seeing boundary reflection effects .",
    "we choose the kerr parameter @xmath53 .",
    "we use quadrupole or octal precision floating ",
    "point arithmetic throughout according to need .",
    "we emphasize that our choice of initial data based on the field and its conjugate momentum is in accord with other common choices .",
    "specifically , when we choose a single value of @xmath21 , our choice of initial data is a pure multipole moment , equivalent to choices made based on the field and its time derivative .",
    "there is no ambiguity in the definition of a pure multipole @xcite .      since the goal of this work is to investigate the late - time decay rate of higher multipole modes of kerr black holes a number of improvements to our time - domain teukolsky equation code",
    "were necessary .",
    "this is because generating accurate numerical data in the context of higher multipole modes involves a number of challenges .",
    "firstly , these simulations need to be rather long  this is because typically the observed field exhibits an exponentially decaying oscillatory behavior ( `` quasi- normal ringing '' ) in the initial part of the evolution and only much later this transitions over to a clean power - law decay .",
    "one needs to wait for these oscillations to dissipate away . for higher multipoles this phase lasts much longer , thus requiring significantly longer evolutions . secondly , because each multipole has a different decay rate ( which increases with an increase in @xmath21 ) at late times one ends up with numerical data in which different multipoles have widely different amplitudes ( often 30  40 orders of magnitude apart ! ) .",
    "for this reason , not only does the numerical solution scheme have to be high - order ( to reduce the discretization errors to the required levels ) but it also requires high - precision floating - point numerical computation ( due to the large range of amplitudes involved ) .    below we list the major improvements made since the publication of @xcite to our teukolsky equation evolution code :    1 .   _",
    "higher - order algorithm : _ as mentioned above , we require a higher - order numerical evolution scheme to keep the discretization errors to sufficiently low levels , otherwise these can overwhelm the numerical data associated to the weakly excited higher multipole modes of interest .",
    "it turns out that it is sufficient that only the angular differentiation ( i.e. @xmath54-derivatives of the field ) be implemented using a higher - order numerical stencil .",
    "the temporal and the radial direction related operations can simply stay 2nd - order and such a mixed approach yields sufficiently good results @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in this work we choose the finite - difference angular differentiation operator to be 10th - order accurate and leave the rest of the numerical scheme as a standard 2nd - order lax - wendroff algorithm .",
    "_ higher - order projection integrals : _ we also require a matching 10th - order accuracy in mode projection integrals to prevent numerical integration errors from overwhelming the higher multipole numerical data .",
    "higher - order numerical precision : _ as pointed out above , we also require high - numerical precision in our computations .",
    "in particular , double , quadruple and octal precision may be required depending upon the details of kerr tails simulation being attempted .",
    "this is simply to prevent roundoff error from overwhelming the weakly excited modes of interest  especially important for  up \" excited higher multiple modes !",
    "we made use of quadruple precision ( in some cases , octal precision ) floating - point accuracy in this work .",
    "now , very few current computer processors support full quadruple - precision ( 128bit ) datatype and operations .",
    "and to the best of our knowledge , no compute hardware natively supports octal - precision ( 256bit ) arithmetic .",
    "thus , we implemented such high - precision computations in software using publicly available software libraries .",
    "this made our work particularly challenging computationally , because with each such increase in numerical precision , our code s overall performance drops by an order - of - magnitude .",
    "_ code parallelism and hpc hardware : _ in order to perform the numerical simulations in a reasonable time - frame , we made use of message - passing ( mpi ) based parallelism in our code and also used sophisticated hpc hardware . in particular , domain - decomposition based parallelism was implemented in the code and ibm cell be and power7 systems with specialized optimizations @xcite were used to perform these long evolutions in a reasonable time - frame .",
    "_ other enhancements : _ we also enhanced the code further to be able to evolve non - axisymmetric mode computations ( both odd and even @xmath2-modes ) .",
    "the even @xmath2-mode case was straightforward to implement , since these simply require some additional terms in the evolution equation .",
    "for the odd @xmath2-mode case we used the following procedure to simplify our implementation : instead of evolving the scalar field @xmath27 itself , we transformed the teukolsky equation to evolve the field @xmath55 .",
    "this simple transformation enabled us to reuse several of our even @xmath2-mode code algorithms ( such as the higher - order angular boundary condition imposition ) and also avoid the introduction of non - polynomial functions of the code s angular grid variable , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "we first show for the first time numerical tests of the barack  ori formula @xcite .",
    "then , in section [ sec : up ] we show how the barack  ori formula is a particular case for  up \" excitation of modes .",
    "barack and ori noted that in the generic case of black hole perturbations , all dynamically allowed modes are present .",
    "specifically , in the case of scalar field perturbations , all modes , starting with the monopole ( @xmath57 ) evolve .",
    "the decay rate of a multipole @xmath21 with azimuthal number @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath58 where @xmath59 if @xmath60 is even or odd , respectively .",
    "notably , the barack  ori formula depends explicitly on the azimuthal number @xmath2 , and like the hod formula includes a certain complexity that has to do with whether @xmath60 is even or odd .",
    "the meaning of  generic \" initial data is that the relative amplitudes of the various multipoles and their radial profiles are not fine tuned .",
    "consider , e.g. , the following initial data set , @xmath44 and @xmath61 , where @xmath46 is any localized radial function , say a gaussian .",
    "these initial data include non - vanishing monopole and quadrapole moments .",
    "we evolved these data numerically , and found that as expected the late  time tail includes all even multipoles , and is dominated by the monopole field that decays according to @xmath11 at late times .",
    "the quadrapole projection of the late ",
    "time field decays according to @xmath12 , in accordance with the barack  ori formula .",
    "other choices of initial data sets and multipoles are also found to be in agreement with the barack  ori formula .",
    "as far as the present authors are aware , this is the first direct numerical confirmation of the barack  ori formula .",
    "let us now consider the following scenario : one starts with initial data as above , and evolves the field to a certain value of time , say to @xmath62 .",
    "the field at @xmath62 is a complicated mixture of modes , each with its own radial profile .",
    "now consider a different initial value problem , in which at @xmath40 only a pure multipole , say the quadrapole moment , is non - vanishing , and evolve these initial data to @xmath62 .",
    "these pure mode initial data also evolve to a complicated mixture of multipole moments at @xmath62 , and at first look one does not notice much qualitative difference between the fields at @xmath62 .",
    "however , treating the fields at @xmath62 as new initial value problems , further time evolution leads to different decay rates at late times .",
    "specifically , the generic data lead to quadrapole projection that drops off like @xmath12 , and the pure data lead to quadrapole projection that drops off like @xmath63 . considering only the values at @xmath62 as the initial data sets , what is the fundamental difference between the two sets , that leads to very different late ",
    "time evolutions ?",
    "even though either set appears at @xmath62 to be a set of amplitudes with weighted ratios for the various multipole moments ( as functions of the radial coordinate ) , the set describing the pure mode evolution is made at @xmath62 of a very carefully chosen set of ( @xmath10 dependent ) amplitudes .",
    "in fact , it is the outcome of fine  tuned evolution of a pure mode of the original initial value problem .",
    "examination of the data set at @xmath62 does not reveal anything qualitative different about it : it is the specific amplitude ratios and radial profiles that make it non - generic .     with a pure quadrapole field .",
    "time field behavior is computationally found to be given by @xmath64 .",
    "the power law index , and all the indices in this paper , were calculated by extrapolating the local power - law index to infinite time.,width=326 ]    one may test these ideas by injecting at @xmath62 another field , say that of a pure mode .",
    "start at @xmath40 with a pure quadrapolar field .",
    "at @xmath62 the projection of the field is a mixture of all even multipoles .",
    "then , at @xmath62 , inject either a pure monopole or a pure quadrapole with some radial profile .",
    "the multipolar content of the field after the injection is changed in that the relative multipolar amplitudes changed ( as functions of the radius ) . when the injected field is quadrapolar , the late  time decay rate of the quadrapole moment is @xmath63 , as should be expected from the fact that we have a superposition of two linear pure mode evolutions ( which a certain time delay between them ) ( fig .",
    "[ wave0 ] ) .",
    "when the injected field is a monopole , the late  time decay rate of the quadrapole moment is @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ wave1 ] ) .",
    "the addition of a monopole field ( without fine tuning its amplitude and radial profile ) makes the multipolar content of the total field generic .",
    "one may pose the following question : when the injected field is a quadrapole , its time evolution will excite a monopole .",
    "why in the presence of this excited monopole the quadrapole projection of the field decays like @xmath63 , whereas in the presence of an injected monopole the decay rate is the slower @xmath12 ? there is a fundamental difference between the two cases : the excited monopole is not an arbitrary field : it is carefully chosen by the dynamics of the problem , and may be viewed as a fine tuned field ; the injected monopole is arbitrary , and is not fine tuned to lead to a different late  time decay rate .     with a pure monopole field . the late  time field behavior",
    "is computationally found to be given by @xmath65.,width=326 ]",
    "most interest has been devoted to finding the decay rate of the slowest decaying mode , for obvious reasons .",
    "specifically , the slowest decaying mode determines the late  time behavior of the full field . as",
    "lower multipole modes typically have a slower decay rate , most interest has naturally focused on the excitation of  down \" modes , specifically the excitation of lower multipole modes starting with higher multipole modes .    here , we are interested in the converse , i.e. , in the excitation and decay rate of  up \" modes , i.e. , the excitation and decay rate of a higher multipole mode than the one initially excited .",
    "such modes are typically sub - dominant , and do not dominate the late  time behavior of the full field .",
    "our interest in the  up \" modes is therefore only tangentially related to the question of the decay rate of the full field .",
    "instead , it is the gaining of more insight towards a more complete understanding of the dynamics and mode coupling properties thereof we are interested in here .",
    "denoting the initially excited _ pure _ multipole by @xmath20 , and the multipole moment of the field whose excitation and decay are is of interest by @xmath21 ( so that for  up \"- modes @xmath25 and for  down \"- modes @xmath5 ) , we propose that the late  time decay rate for excited @xmath66 modes along a @xmath67 worldline , is given by @xmath3 where @xmath68 notably , this formula is independent of @xmath2 . specifically , for all ( allowed ) values of @xmath2 the decay rate of the @xmath21 excited multipole because of an initial @xmath20 is the same .",
