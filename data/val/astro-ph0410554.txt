    "the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) is the largest statistically complete gravitational lens survey ever undertaken .",
    "a complete sample of 11  685 flat - spectrum radio sources ( @xmath0 where @xmath1 between 1.4 and 4.85  ghz ) was observed with the very large array ( vla ) in a configuration at 8.46  ghz between 1994 and 1999 .",
    "the 0.2-arcsec angular resolution provided by the vla allowed the straight forward identification of galaxy - scale gravitational lenses , which typically have image separations of @xmath2  arcsec .",
    "class sources were identified as promising gravitational lens candidates if the vla 8.46  ghz image contained multiple compact components with gaussian fwhm @xmath3  mas , the image separations were between @xmath4  arcsec , the total integrated flux - density was @xmath5  mjy and the component flux - density ratio was @xmath6 .",
    "the detection of compact structure and extended emission in the multiple components at higher resolutions with merlin ( multi - element radio linked interferometer network ) and the vlba ( very long baseline array ) confirmed the lensing hypothesis for 21 gravitational lenses during the first three phases of class ( see @xcite and references therein for a discussion of all the gravitational lenses discovered by class ) .    in this paper , we present observations of the gravitational lens candidate class b2108 + 213 , which was discovered during the fourth and final phase of class . in section [ radio ]",

    "is presented in section [ photometry ] . using the available observational data , the lensing hypothesis , along with an analysis of the lensing potential , is discussed in section [ disc ] .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarise our findings and outline the future work we intend to carry out on this intriguing new gravitational lens from class . for all calculations we adopt an @xmath7 , @xmath8 flat - universe , with a hubble parameter of @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "class b2108 + 213 was observed with the vla in a configuration at 8.46  ghz as part of the final phase of class on 1999 august 17 .",
    "the total on - source integration time was @xmath11 seconds .",
    "a 3.3 second correlator integration time with two 50  mhz ifs were used .",
    "3c286 was chosen as the primary flux - density calibrator and phase - referencing was carried out with jvas b2059 + 034 ( jodrell bank vla astrometric survey ; @xcite ) .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated in the standard way using aips ( astronomical image processing software ) and imaged within the caltech vlbi difference mapping package ( difmap ; @xcite ) using the class mapping script @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12-data were naturally weighted and elliptical gaussian model components were fitted to each image .",
    "the rms noise level was 180  @xmath13jy  beam@xmath10 and the beam size was @xmath14  arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "the vla detected three compact components , shown in fig .",
    "[ vla - map ] , whose flux - densities and relative positions are given in table [ data - tab ] and table [ 2108-relative ] , respectively . with an image separation between components",
    "a and b of 4.56  arcsec , class b2108 + 213 has a wider image separation than any gravitational lens system thus far discovered by class ( see fig .",
    "[ image - sep ] for the class gravitational lens image separation distribution ) .",
    "the total integrated flux - density of the system at 8.46  ghz is 18.5  mjy and the flux - density ratio between the brightest and faintest components is @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , class b2108 + 213 failed to meet the strict lens candidate selection criteria due to its total integrated 8.46  ghz flux - density being less than 20  mjy .",
    "however , class b2108 + 213 was followed up as a promising lens candidate even though it was no longer part of the statistically well defined class sample .",

    "we have presented radio and optical observations of the new gravitational lens class b2108 + 213 .",
    "this system comprises two lensed images , which are separated by 4.56  arcsec , thus making class b2108 + 213 the widest separation gravitational lens discovered by class .",
    "optical imaging found two lensing galaxies within the einstein radius of the system .",
    "intriguingly , we also detected radio emission from a third component which was coincident with the optical emission from the primary lensing galaxy .",
    "the extension of the third radio component and its different radio spectrum from the two lensed images suggests that it is unlikely to be a third lensed image .",
    "however , it is too early to completely discount the possibility that scatter broadening effects might have been responsible for modifying the properties of a third image .",
    "the positions and flux - densities of the lensed images were successfully reproduced by a model containing two singular isothermal spheres and an external shear . however , further observational constraints will need to be obtained for a detailed analysis of the class b2108 + 213 lensing potential to be carried out .",
    "the wide image separation of class b2108 + 213 implies a group / cluster assisted lensing potential .",
    "therefore , class b2108 + 213 provides an excellent opportunity to study the structure and mass distribution of galaxy groups beyond the local universe ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we have begun a spectroscopic programme to determine the redshifts of the lensing galaxies and lensed source in class b2108 + 213 , and to identify which nearby galaxies are part of the lensing group .",
    "thus far we have found four nearby galaxies at similar redshifts to g1 ( @xmath18 ; mckean et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . furthermore , our spectrum of g1 has sufficient signal - to - noise for the stellar velocity dispersion to be measured .",
    "these observations will provide additional constraints for a future mass model .",
    "the other interesting feature of class b2108 + 213 is the possible detection of a third lensed image .",
    "although the observations presented here show that this is almost certainly not the case , this conclusion could be confirmed by measuring the flux - density , polarization and size of the radio emission from each component as a function of frequency .",
    "if scattering of a third lensed image is occurring then we would expect the high frequency spectrum of each radio component to be identical .",
