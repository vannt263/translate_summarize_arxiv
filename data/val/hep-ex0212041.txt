    "neutrino oscillations @xcite have been observed at experiments such as homestake @xcite , super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite , and sno @xcite",
    ". further exploration using a neutrino factory could reveal effects such as cp violation in the lepton sector which could explain the matter  antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this synchrotron must accelerate muons from 4 to 20 gev / c with moderate decay loss . because synchrotron radiation goes as @xmath2 , muons radiate two billion times ( @xmath3 ) less power than electrons for any given ring diameter and lepton energy .",
    "magnet eddy current losses are minimized by the low duty cycle of the machine plus thin iron laminations and copper conductors .",
    "grain oriented silicon steel is used to provide a high magnetic field with a high @xmath4 to minimize magnetic energy stored in the return yoke . the magnetic energy stored in the gap",
    "is minimized by reducing its size .",
    "cool muons @xcite with low beam emittance allow this . stored energy goes as @xmath5 .",
    "the voltage required to drive a magnet is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "very high voltage is expensive .",
    "@xmath7 must be large because of the 2 @xmath4sec muon lifetime , so the main option for lowering voltage is to shrink the volume of stored energy to reduce the inductance , @xmath8 .",
    "acceleration to 4 gev might feature fixed field dogbone arcs @xcite to minimize muon decay loss .",
    "fast ramping synchrotrons @xcite might also accelerate muons to higher energies for a @xmath9 collider @xcite .",
    "as a first step , we form arcs with sequences of combined function cells formed within continuous long magnets , whose poles are alternately shaped to give focusing gradients of each sign .",
    "an example of such a cell has been simulated using synch @xcite .",
    "the example has gradients that alternate from positive 20 t / m gradient ( 2.24 m long ) , to zero gradient ( .4 m long ) to negative 20 t / m gradient ( 2.24 m ) to zero gradient ( 0.4 m ) , etc .",
    "the relatively short zero gradient section is included to approximate a real smooth change in the gradients .",

    "to get an idea , take the maximum b - field during a cycle to be that generated by a 0.025 m radius conductor carrying 26000 amps . the eddy current loss in a rectangular conductor made of transposed square wires .25 mm wide ( sometimes called litz wire @xcite ) with a perpendicular magnetic field is as follows .",

    "so the iron will need some cooling .",
    "the ring only ramps 30 time per second , so the @xmath15 hysteresis losses will be low , even more so because of the low coercive force , h@xmath16 , of grain oriented silicon steel .",
    "the low duty cycle of the neutrino factory leads to reasonable eddy current losses in a 4600 hz ring .",
    "muon survival is 83% . the high permeability of grain oriented silicon steel permits high fields with little energy stored in the yoke .",
    "gradients are switched within dipoles to minimize eddy current losses in ends .",
    "time dilation allows extra orbits with little muon decay at the end of a cooling cycle .",
    "this allows one to use more of the stored rf energy .",
    "much of the magnetic field in our lattice is used for focusing rather than bending the muon beam .",
    "more muon cooling would lead to less focusing , more bending , and an even smaller ring .",
