    "various approaches to quantum gravity , such as string theory and loop quantum gravity as well as black hole physics , predict a minimum measurable length of the order of the planck length , @xmath1 . in the presence of this minimal observable length",
    ", the standard heisenberg uncertainty principle attains an important modification leading to the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) . as a result",
    ", corresponding commutation relations between position and momenta are generalized too @xcite . in recent years",
    "a lot of attention has been attracted to extend the fundamental problems of physics in this framework ( see for instance @xcite ) . since",
    "in the gup framework one can not probe distances smaller than the minimum measurable length at finite time , we expect it modifies the hamiltonian of systems too .",
    "recently it has been shown that the gup affects lamb shift , landau levels , reflection and transmission coefficients of a potential step and potential barrier @xcite .",
    "in addition , they speculated on the possibility of extracting measurable predictions of gup in the future experiments . in this work we will follow the procedure introduced in the ref .",
    "@xcite , but we are going to address the effect of gup on the ramsauer - townsend ( rt ) effect . the rt effect can be observed as long as the scattering does not become inelastic by excitation of the first excited state of the atom .",
    "this condition is best fulfilled by the closed shell noble gas atoms .",
    "physically , the rt effect may be thought of as a diffraction of the electron around the rare - gas atom , in which the wave function inside the atom is distorted in such a way that it fits on smoothly to an undistorted wave function outside .",
    "the effect is analogous to the perfect transmission found at particular energies in one - dimensional scattering from a square well .",
    "the one - dimensional treatment of scattering from a square well and also three - dimensional treatment using the partial waves analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "we generalize the one - dimensional treatment of the scattering from a square well to the gup framework .",
    "we also address the condition for interference in the fabry - perot interferometer in the framework of gup .",
    "quantum mechanics with modification of the usual canonical commutation relations has been investigated intensively in the last few years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . such works which are motivated by several independent streamlines of investigations in string theory and quantum gravity , suggest the existence of a finite lower bound to the possible resolution @xmath2 of spacetime points .",
    "the following deformed commutation relation has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite @xmath3=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2 ) , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] and it was shown that it implies the existence of a minimal resolution length @xmath4 .",
    "this means that there is no possibility to measure coordinate @xmath5 with accuracy smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "since in the context of the string theory the minimum observable distance is the string length , we conclude that @xmath7 is proportional to this length . if we set @xmath8 , the usual heisenberg algebra is recovered .",
    "the use of the deformed commutation relation ( [ eq1 ] ) brings new difficulties in solving the quantum problems .",
    "a part of difficulties is related to the break down of the notion of locality and position space representation in this framework @xcite .",
    "the above commutation relation results in the following uncertainty relation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gup parameter and @xmath11 is a positive constant that depends on the expectation value of the momentum operator . in fact , we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planck mass and @xmath14 is of the order of unity .",
    "we expect that these quantities are only relevant in the domain of the planck energy @xmath15gev .",
    "therefore , in the low energy regime , the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are irrelevant and one recovers the well - known heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "these parameters , in principle , can be obtained from the underlying quantum gravity theory such as string theory . moreover , the comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) shows that @xmath16 .",
    "now , let us define @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 obey the canonical commutation relations @xmath20=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "one can check that using eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is satisfied up to @xmath21 .",
    "also , from the above equation we can interpret @xmath19 as the momentum operator at low energies ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 as the momentum operator at high energies .",
    "now , consider the following form of the hamiltonian : @xmath24 which using eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in the quantum domain ,",
    "this hamiltonian results in the following generalized schrdinger equation in the quasi - position representation @xmath28 where the second term in the left side is due to the generalized commutation relation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this equation is a fourth - order differential equation which in principle admits four independent solutions .",
    "therefore , solving this equation in @xmath18 space and separating the physical solutions is not an easy task . with these preliminaries , in the next section we solve equation ( [ eq7 ] ) for a quantum well to address the rt effect and the fabry - perot interferometer resonance condition in the presence of the minimal observable length .",
    "we choose the following geometry of the quantum well ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a positive constant and we assume @xmath31 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a particle in this potential well satisfy the generalized schrdinger equation ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "we need to find the solutions in three different regions which are indicated in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . to proceed further , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) in these regions separately as @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 elsewhere , where by definition @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . as state",
    "before , the above equations are forth - order differential equations which in general admit four independent solutions",
    ". however , some solutions would be unphysical which should be removed upon imposing the boundary conditions . as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , alternatively , we can find the equivalent physical solutions by adding the following constraint : the physical solutions should also satisfy the ordinary schrdinger equation but with different eigenenergy . in fact , for the cases of a free particle and a particle in a box , this additional condition prevents us from doing equivalent but lengthy calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we demand that the eigenfunctions also satisfy the following second - order differential equations : @xmath39 for @xmath33 , and @xmath40 elsewhere , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq12a ] ) and ( [ eq13a ] ) in regions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath46 respectively .",
    "these solutions should also satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) which result in @xmath47 these solutions are similar to the solutions of the ordinary quantum mechanics but with modified wavenumbers .",
    "now the boundary conditions are the continuity of the wave functions and their first derivatives at the boundaries .",
    "the resulting equations can be solved analytically to obtain the coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . for our purposes ,",
    "the solution for @xmath48 is as follows @xmath52 so the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath53 because of the smallness of the planck length , we can obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 from eq .",

    "this figure compares also the ordinary quantum mechanical result with corresponding result in the presence of a minimal observable length .",
    "versus the energy @xmath57 for @xmath8 ( solid line ) , @xmath58 ( dashed line ) , @xmath59 ( dot - dashed line ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62.,width=302 ]    at this point , it is worth to mention that the rectangular potential well is an idealization , and it would be desirable to evaluate the admitted deviations of a real potential from this ideal one . indeed , in reality , the sharp edges are changed to the smoothed out edges .",
    "a proper candidate for this case is the woods - saxon potential which has the following functional form @xcite : @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are real and positive , and @xmath66 is the heaviside step function . for @xmath67",
    "this potential closely resembles a rectangular well with smooth edges and size @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this potential is exactly solvable in relativistic and non - relativistic cases and the solutions can be written in terms of the hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "since these solutions smoothly converge to the plane wave solutions for @xmath67 , we expect that the gup - corrected reflection coefficient of this system also continuously tends to eq .",
    "( [ wide ] ) at this limit .",
    "however , for this case the wave function can not satisfy both the ordinary and gup - corrected schrdinger equations simultaneously .",
    "this is due to the fact that the potential is not constant inside the well .",
    "this problem needs further investigation and we are going to study it in a separate program .     with @xmath68 ( solid line ) and @xmath69 ( dashed line).,width=302 ]    for the particular case where @xmath70=0 $ ] , there is no reflection , that is @xmath71 and therefore we will have maximum transmission .",
    "this is the ramsauer - townsend effect . in this case @xmath72 in ordinary quantum mechanics this effect occurs at those wavenumbers that satisfy the condition @xmath73 .",
    "this feature shows that there is a shift ( @xmath74 ) in the wavenumber of the transmission resonance and this shift itself is wavenumber - dependent .",
    "up to the first - order in the gup parameter , we find @xmath75 we also note that in ordinary quantum mechanical description , the condition for resonance is @xmath76 which is the same condition as in fabry - perot interferometer . in the presence of the minimal observable length , this condition modifies as follows @xmath77 therefore , in the presence of the minimal length , the condition for interference in fabry - perot interferometer will change too .",
    "amazingly , this change is itself wavelength - dependent .    up to this point , we have addressed the rt effect and the fabry - perot interferometer resonance condition in the gup framework . to complete our treatment of this interesting quantum mechanical problem ,",
    "let us consider the negative energy case @xmath78 which results in the quantized energy spectrum .",
    "in this case , eqs .",
    "( [ eq12a ] ) and ( [ eq13a ] ) cast into the following equations : @xmath79 for @xmath33 , and @xmath80 elsewhere , where by definition @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "so the solutions are @xmath83 if we choose the center of the well as the center of the coordinate system , it is straightforward to check that the energy eigenvalues are given by the roots of equations @xmath84 for even and odd eigenstates , respectively .",
    "these eigenvalues can also be written in terms of physical quantities @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87&= & \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2mv_0}{\\hbar^2}-q^2}\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{p}^{2 } \\left(\\frac{2mv_0}{\\hbar^2}-q^2\\right)\\right]}{q\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{p}^{2}q^2\\right)},\\\\ \\cot\\left[q\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{p}^{2}q^2\\right)a/2\\right]&= & -\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2mv_0}{\\hbar^2}-q^2}\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{p}^{2 } \\left(\\frac{2mv_0}{\\hbar^2}-q^2\\right)\\right]}{q\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{p}^{2}q^2\\right)}. \\label{eq030}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , for the negative energy case , the energy eigenvalues are the roots of eq .",
    "( [ eq030 ] ) .",
    "we note that there is no trace of the rt effect for @xmath78 case .",
    "the scattering cross section of electrons in noble gas atoms exhibits a minimum value at electron energies of approximately @xmath0ev , an effect of which is called the ramsauer - townsend effect .",
    "we studied the rt effect in the presence of the minimal observable length in the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of the minimal observable length there is a shift @xmath88 in the wavenumber of the transmission resonance and this shift itself is wavenumber dependent .",
    "this shift also affects the resonance in the fabry - perot interferometer in such a way that this change is itself wavelength dependent .",
    "if in the future experiments one finds a similar shift in fabry - perot interferometer resonance wavelength , it would be an explicit trace of underlying quantum gravity scenario .",
    "we note also that the rt effect is in principle a 3-dimensional effect that needs a 3-dimensional analysis .",
    "corresponding calculations in 3-dimensions are so lengthy and the essential ingredients and outcomes are the same as presented in this one - dimensional analysis . finally , we note that this problem can be treated with more real potentials such as the woods - saxon potential to have more realistic situation .",
    "this potential is exactly solvable in relativistic and non - relativistic cases and the solutions can be written in terms of the hypergeometric functions . since these solutions smoothly converge to the plane wave solutions in appropriate limit , we expect that the gup - corrected reflection coefficient of this system also continuously tends to our result at this limit .",
    "we are going to treat this more real situation in a separate research program .",
