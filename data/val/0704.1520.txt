    "another consequence is the anomalous statistical physics that includes the non - maxwellian velocity distributions @xcite and the breakdown of energy equipartition in mixtures @xcite .    for an elastic gas in equilibrium ,",
    "the temperature , defined as the average kinetic energy , characterizes the entire distribution function including all of the moments , the bulk of the distribution , as well as the tail of the distribution . outside of equilibrium ,",
    "the temperature is not sufficient to characterize the energy distribution .",
    "granular gases are inherently out of equilibrium and a complete characterization must therefore include the behavior of typical particles , the behavior of energetic particles , as well as the moments of the distribution .",
    "for example , the energy distribution may have power - law tails with divergent high - order moments @xcite and consequently , the moments exhibit multiscaling @xcite .",
    "generally , nonequilibrium effects are pronounced in the absence of energy input to balance the dissipation but can be suppressed by injection of energy where the deviation from a maxwellian distribution affects only extremely energetic particles @xcite .    while there is substantial understanding of the energy distribution of frictionless granular gases , much less",

    "equipartition does not hold for the average rotational and translational temperature  neither in the free cooling case @xcite nor for a driven system @xcite . in general ,",
    "rotational and linear degrees of freedom are correlated in direction @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nature of the full energy distribution , that is , the bivariate distribution of rotational and translational energy . motivated by the fact that on average the total energy is not partitioned equally between rotational and translational degrees of freedom ,",
    "we focus on the bivariate distribution @xmath5 of total energy @xmath0 and the modified ratio @xmath1 of rotational to total energy .",
    "we thereby generalize the understanding of frictionless granular matter in terms of the energy distribution to rough grains .",
    "our starting point is the nonlinear boltzmann equation with a collision rule that accounts for the coupling of translational and rotational motion due to tangential restitution .",
    "we study stationary solutions of the inelastic boltzmann equation that describe steady states achieved through a balance between energy injections that are powerful but rare and energy dissipation through inelastic collisions . for high - energy particles",
    "we derive a linear equation for the bivariate energy distribution .",
    "the latter can be shown to factorize  @xmath6  into a product of the distribution of the total energy , @xmath7 , and the distribution of the fraction of energy stored in the rotational degrees of freedom , @xmath3 .",
    "the former distribution decays algebraically with energy : @xmath8 .",
    "the fraction of energy stored in rotational motion is universal for energetic particles in the sense that @xmath3 approaches a limiting distribution independent of energy .",
    "furthermore , this quantity has a number of interesting features .",
    "first , the distribution is not uniform , as it would be , if equipartition were to hold .",
    "second , the distribution is not analytic but has singularities at special energy ratios .",
    "third , the distribution and in particular its singularities depend sensitively on the moment of inertia and the collision parameters . only for energetic particles is this distribution well defined . in general",
    ", the partition of energy into rotational and translational motion depends on the magnitude of the energy .",
    "this paper specifically addresses two - dimensions , although the theoretical approach and the reported qualitative behavior are generic .",
    "we also develop a general framework for describing high - energy collisions and we use this framework to study freely cooling maxwell molecules where the moments of the energy distribution can be found in a closed form .",
    "for example , the two granular temperatures corresponding to the rotational and translational motions are coupled and generally , they are not equal . the high - energy behavior found for driven steady - states extends to freely cooling gases .",

    "@xmath19 with the labels @xmath20 , change according to @xmath21 where the postcollision velocities are denoted by primes . in a binary collision ,",
    "rotational and translational energy are exchanged , while the total energy decreases . in this study , we consider tangential restitution in addition to the standard normal restitution .",
    "let @xmath22 be the position of particle @xmath23 , then the directed unit vector connecting the centers of the colliding particles is .",
    "we term this vector the impact direction .",
    "the collision rules are most transparent in terms of @xmath24 the particle velocity at the contact point    [ relative ] @xmath25    the inelastic collision laws state that the normal component of the relative velocity @xmath26 is reversed and reduced by the normal restitution coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "the tangential component is either reversed ( rough particles ) or not ( smooth particles ) and in any case reduced by the tangential restitution coefficient @xmath28 , according to the following collision rules :    [ law ] @xmath29    inelastic collisions conserve linear and angular momentum .",
    "conservation of linear momentum implies that the total linear velocity does not change , and conservation of angular momentum enforces that the angular momentum of each particle with respect to the point of contact remains the same , because there is no torque acting at the point of contact .",
    "the collision laws combined with these conservation laws specify the postcollision velocities as linear combinations of the precollision velocities @xcite    [ rule ] @xmath30    where the shorthand notations and were introduced .",
    "these collision rules involve the normal and tangential collision parameters , defined as @xmath31 their range of values is bounded by and .",
    "details of the derivation of the collision rules are given in appendix a , as they are relevant for our discussion .",

    "there are two gain terms and two loss terms , because the velocities of interest @xmath51 can be identified with any one of the four velocities in the collision rule and the kernel is simply the collision rate .",
    "the focus of this study is the energy distribution that generally depends only on two variables : @xmath52 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is our aim to compute the distribution @xmath53 for asymptotically large energies .",
    "this will be done for a system which is driven at very high energies as well as for an undriven system .    as a first step to this goal",
    ", we simplify the boltzmann equation in the limit of large energies .",
    "extremely energetic particles are rare and as a result it is unlikely that such particles will encounter each other .",
    "hence , energetic particles typically collide with much slower particles .",
    "since the collision rules are linear , the velocity of the slower particle barely affects the outcome of the collision .",
    "we can therefore neglect the slower velocity .",

    "a collision between a high - energy particle and a typical - energy particle produces two energetic particles with an energy total that is smaller than the initial energy .",

    "formally , this linear rate equation can be obtained from the full nonlinear equation by treating either one of the precollision velocities as negligible and then integrating over this small velocity .",
    "this procedure leads to four gain terms and two loss terms and thus , the factor @xmath63 in drops out .",
    "we stress that the linear equation is valid only in the high - energy limit .",
    "we also comment that the linear equation for the high - energy tail of the velocity distribution may be valid in cases where the full nonlinear equation is not .",
    "whereas the nonlinear equation requires that all possible velocities are uncorrelated , the linear equation merely requires that energetic particles are uncorrelated with typical particles .",
    "this is a much weaker condition .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to two space dimensions , i.e. rotating disks . in that case",
    "the rotational velocities are always perpendicular to the linear velocities .",
    "thus , we conveniently denote the unit vector in the tangential direction by @xmath64 and the unit vector coming out of the plane by @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "indeed , the postcollision angles depend only on the precollision angle .",
    "the cascade process has the following geometric interpretation : a three dimensional vector is duplicated into two vectors .",
    "subsequently , these two vectors are scaled down by the contraction parameters , and rotated according to the angular transformation .",

    "henceforth , we implicitly assume that the distribution @xmath106 is independent of @xmath109 because the distribution of _ linear _ velocities must be isotropic .",
    "the integration over the energy is performed using the collision rule , leading to the linear rate equation for the tail of the energy distribution @xmath110.\\]]this is a non - local equation as the density of particles with energy @xmath0 is coupled to the density of particles with the higher energies @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we stress that this equation is a straightforward consequence of the cascade process and that it can also be derived from the full nonlinear boltzmann equation . yet , there may be situations where the linear equation is valid , while the nonlinear equation is not valid .",
