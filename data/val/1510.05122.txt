    "the linear polarization of light scattered by airless solar system objects ( i.e. comets and asteroids ) is a useful tool for investigating the physical properties of their surfaces .",
    "the phase - polarization curves display a common behaviour , having a negative polarization branch at 0@xmath10@xmath2@xmath1120 , positive branch at @xmath1220 , and maximum polarization around @xmath2=90100 , where @xmath2 denotes the solar phase angle ( i.e. sun  object ",
    "observer s angle ) .",
    "the phase - polarization curves of asteroids , usually observed in the mainbelt at a low phase angle ( @xmath1330 ) , provide information about composition ( i.e. taxonomic type ) , optical properties , porosity of the surface regolith layers , and so on ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , comets , which are usually enclosed in a dust coma plus gas contamination , have been observed with polarimeters at a wide range of phase angles , providing the composition , size and structure ( fluffy or compact ) of dust grains in comae @xcite .",
    "although several near - earth asteroids ( neas ) and active comets were observed at large phase angles , little is known about the polarimetric properties of bare comet nuclei at large phase angles . whenever comets are observed at large phase angles ( i.e. @xmath1490 ) ,",
    "their nuclei are supposed to shrouded in thick cometary comae , because comets are located within 1 au in the geometry where they are heated up , creating outflow of dust particles and sublimating ice .",
    "this paper attempted to obtain unique data of the linear polarization degree , @xmath7 , for a bare cometary nucleus as well as dust particles of 209p / linear ( hereafter 209p ) .",
    "the comet is classified among the jupiter - family comets ( hereafter jfcs , the semimajor axis @xmath15=2.932 au , eccentricity @xmath16=0.692 , inclination @xmath17=19.4 , and the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , @xmath18=2.80 ) and known as the parent body of a meteor shower , the may camelopardalids @xcite .",
    "it closely encountered the earth in late may , 2014 , providing us with the opportunity to observe it at large phase angles .",
    "@xcite noticed that 209p nucleus was largely mantled by the surface dust layer , showing very weak activity when it closely approached earth in 2014 april  may .",

    ", we subtracted the faint coma components to derive the nuclear @xmath0 , and compare the results with those of previous studies .",
    "polarimetric observations of 209p were conducted for five nights in 2014 april  may using two telescopes : the hiroshima optical and near - infrared camera ( honir ) on the 1.5-m kanata telescope ( hereafter kanata ) at the higashi - hiroshima astronomical observatory , hiroshima , and the visible multi - spectral imager ( msi ) on the 1.6-m pirka telescope ( pirka ) at hokkaido university s nayoro observatory in hokkaido , japan . in the imaging polarimetric mode ,",
    "each instrument employs a wollaston prism beam - splitter and a rotatable half - wave plate modulator , which produces reliable data sets taking ordinary and extraordinary images simultaneously at four position angles @xmath19=0 , 45 , 22.5 , and 67.5 .",

    "we observed 209p with honir / kanata and msi / pirka at large phase angles , that is , 85.599.5  ( r@xmath21-band ) and 85.589.9  ( j - band ) .",
    "we employed a non - sidereal ( cometary motion ) tracking with msi / pirka , and a sidereal tracking with honir / kanata .",
    "the exposure times were chosen ranging from 45 seconds to 180 seconds depending on the detected fluxes and the apparent motion of 209p .",
    "note that the apparent motion of the comet was fast in late may 2014 ( 57  min@xmath22 with respect to the sidereal tracking ) so that we chose short exposure times to reduce the risk of tracking errors of these telescopes .",
    "details of those observations are summarized in table [ tab : t1 ]",
    ".      observed raw data were processed in the standard manner for astronomical imaging data .",
    "all object frames were bias subtracted , flat fielded , and cosmic ray corrected using the iraf reduction package .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the processed images , which are produced by summing up the reduced ordinary images .",
    "we found that the cometary tail was faint in the image on ut 2014 april 23 but became obvious in the r@xmath21-band image in may 2014 .",
    "the tail extended between the sun  comet vector and the negative heliocentric velocity vector , which is typical of cometary dust tails ( rather than ion tails ) . on the contrary , the tail was not detected in the j - band image due to the low s / n ratio . we noticed the comet was slightly stretched in the apparent direction of movement in the image taken with honir / kanata because we could not employ a comet - tracking mode with the kanata telescope ( theoretically , it stretched by 1.8  on may 23 , 2.8  on may 1 , and 3.7  on may 17 , comparable to or slightly larger than the fwhm in honir images ) .    imaging polarimetric data have often been analyzed to produce the two - dimensional polarization maps @xcite . however , since the dust tail was too faint to permit us to make a map , we examined the spatial variation of the linear polarization degrees in the following manner : we first extracted individual source fluxes on the ordinary and extraordinary images by means of the iraf _ apphot _ task .",
    "each flux was numerically integrated over the desired circular aperture and the sky background was subtracted using the surrounding annulus ( i.e. aperture photometry ) .",
    "we set the aperture size ranging from one to five times the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm , 2.63.5 ) of 209p .",

    "it is unclear for the flux contrast between the nucleus and the coma @xcite .",
    "we chose the data from two nights ( ut 2014 may 4 and 19 ) obtained with pirka to allow the use of the precise non - sidereal tracking . the radial profiles of 209p",
    "were obtained from the co - added frames , which used only ordinary intensities at the four half - wave plate angles .",
    "stellar radial profiles were defined from the standard star images in the same night .",
    "these data were converted into the one - dimensional azimuthally averaged surface brightness by the _ pradprof _",
    "task in iraf .",
    "the profile parameters were determined by the best fit model with the moffat psf fitting function @xcite .",
    "the reduced magnitudes of the nucleus on these two nights , @xmath43=19.92@xmath400.26 mag and @xmath43=20.02@xmath400.26 mag , were calculated using an empirical formula , @xmath43=16.24 + 0.04@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows the radial profiles 209p ( open circles ) together with nucleus model ( solid line ) on these two nights .",
    "it is clear that the observed fluxes are dominated by the nucleus at the radial distance within @xmath442@xmath20fwhm , while by the coma beyond @xmath442@xmath20fwhm .",
    "to distinguish the nuclear polarization degrees from the coma polarization degree , we made a plot of the polarization degrees taken with different aperture sizes with respect to the ratio of the modelled nuclear flux to the observed flux , @xmath45 ( figure [ fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "we considered the error associated not only with the signal - to - noise ratio and the uncertainty in the sky background determination , but also with the uncertainty of the nuclear magnitude model ( i.e. 0.26 mag , * ? ? ? * ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , the data with smaller apertures are plotted in the upper right , while the data with larger apertures are plotted in the lower left .",
    "this trend implies that the cometary nucleus is more polarized than the coma . in principal , the @xmath7-intercept ( i.e. @xmath45=0 )",
    "is supposed to approach the coma polarization degree while the intersection with @xmath45=1 approaches the nuclear polarization degree .",
    "we thus assumed that the data points in figure [ fig : f3 ] can be fitted with a simple linear function , @xmath7 = ( @xmath46 ) @xmath20 @xmath45 + @xmath0 , where @xmath0 and @xmath4 are polarization degrees of the nucleus and coma , respectively , and derived these values by the method of least squares .",
    "as the result of fitting , we obtained the polarization degree @xmath0=30.3@xmath47% at @xmath2=92.2and @xmath0=31.0@xmath48% at @xmath2=99.5  for the nucleus , and @xmath4=28.8@xmath5% at @xmath2=92.2  and@xmath4=29.6@xmath6% at @xmath2=99.5  for the coma .",
    "a somewhat surprising result may be derived as the polarization degree for the nucleus .      in table",
    "[ tab : t2 ] , the position angle of the strongest electric vectors , @xmath30 , is in good agreement with those of normal vector to the scattering plane projected on the celestial plane , @xmath49 ( see table [ tab : t1 ] ) to an accuracy of a few degrees . for a spherical body , @xmath30",
    "is supposed to align to the normal vector of the scattering plane , and therefore , @xmath30=@xmath49 .",
    "although the radar image of 209p showed an irregular shape @xcite , such a regional irregularity may be smoothed out by integrating the flux through the disk .",
    "these high polarizations for nucleus indicate a light scattering feature on an object a few kilometers in size ( 2.5 km@xmath203.2 km , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the polarization degree for an airless body is primarily controlled by the surface albedos , the low albedo of the nucleus ( the geometric albedo @xmath500.05 , * ? ?",
    "* ) would result in the high polarization degree .",
    "however , we are unable to confirm this because of a lack of precedent for such dark airless bodies ( typically @xmath510.1 ) .",
    "the following studies were shown potential for becoming the high polarization degree ( @xmath4430% ) of the dark bodies around @xmath2=95 .",
    "there are studies of near - nuclear polarization for 2p / encke ( @xmath9=0.05@xmath400.02 , * ? ? ?",
    "high and low polarizations have been reported to @xmath7=34.9%@xmath401.7% at @xmath2=94.6  ( @xmath7=39.9%@xmath402.9% when corrected for the nh@xmath52 contamination ) in the red domain ( 662/5.9 nm ) @xcite and @xmath7=11%@xmath403% at @xmath2=92.9  in the green domain ( 526/5.6 nm ) @xcite respectively .",
    "considering the contamination by the gaseous species , both studies were measured through the narrow band filter for the same appearance .",
    "note the difference that only the spectral gradient is incompletely explained as pointed out by @xcite .",

    "thus , more observations of dark asteroids are needed to investigate the positive polarization at the higher phase angle .    for the coma ,",
    "such positive polarization with a maximum of @xmath8 = 2530@xmath53 around @xmath2=95  in the red domain was reported in previous studies of the high @xmath8 comets ( see figure [ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "our measurements for the coma are consistent with them .",
    "we found from honir measurements that the wavelength dependence of the polarization for the mixture of the nucleus and coma was negligibly small , that is , @xmath7=30%@xmath403% in r@xmath21-band and @xmath7=27%@xmath405% in j - band at @xmath2=89.9  with the aperture size of 13@xmath20fwhm , although the error of the measurement was not good enough to compare with previous studies .",
    "figure [ fig : f4 ] shows the phase angle dependence of the polarization degrees of the nucleus and coma . for comparison , we show the previous studies for cometary comae at phase angles larger than about 80  and two red continuum lines through the use of the database of comet polarimetry @xcite .",
    "our data shows a moderate increase from 83.5  to 99.5  and no clear peak .",
    "there are known to be two classes of comets in terms of the maximum polarization @xmath8 , so - called high - polarization comets and low - polarization comets. @xcite reported that these two classes of comets have similar polarization properties at @xmath5440  but are bifurcated at larger phase angles .",
    "the high - polarization comets have the peak polarization @xmath5525%28% around @xmath2=90100 , while the low - polarization comets have @xmath5515% around the same phase angle .",
    "in addition , @xcite described the high - polarization comets as tending to be classified as dusty comets , while the low - polarization comets tend to be classified as gassy comets based on optical spectra .",
    "however , the latter case was evaluated as a misleading definition due to the gas contaminations through the broadband filter @xcite . in the near - nucleus region ,",
    "the polarizations of some low - polarization comets reach to those of high - polarization comets @xcite .",
    "first of all , we would like to discuss the contamination of polarization degree by gas emissions .",
    "the observed polarization degrees of comets are known to be occasionally contaminated by gas emissions that reduce the observed polarization degree .",
    "in fact , gas - rich comets tend to display low polarization degrees probably because of the depolarization of the gas emission @xcite . however , we found that the observed spectra of the 209p coma showed no detectable gas emission in the wavelength range in which we deduced the polarization degree .",
    "figure [ fig : f5 ] shows the optical spectra on ut 2014 may 27 , only about a week after our polarimetric run , taken at the nishi - harima astronomical observatory with the medium and low  dispersion long  slit spectrograph ( malls ) attached to the nayuta 2.0m telescope .",
    "we employed the lowest - resolution grating ( 150 line mm@xmath22 ) , 8slit , and the order cut filter of wg320 , ensuring the available spectrum at the wavelength 500730 nm with the spectral resolution @xmath5690 .",
    "note that the continuum slope might be affected by insufficient calibration of the flux with the standard star taken at slightly different airmass .",
    "we normalized the obtained reflectance spectrum at 550 nm and subtracted the continuum by the spline interpolation .",
    "figure [ fig : f5 ] shows the continuum - subtracted spectrum with the typical emission lines labelled @xcite .",
    "there are clearly no detectable emission lines in the coverage of our r@xmath21 filter , dispelling the gas contamination .",
    "similar results are reported through spectroscopic observation on ut 2014 april 9 that a spectrum in the 350600 nm range reveals no cn , c@xmath57 , or c@xmath58 emission features @xcite .",
    "although there might be time variation in the intensity of gas emission , we conjecture that the variation would be small in our polarimetric data because the r@xmath21-band monitoring magnitudes did not change over this period @xcite .",
    "we distinguished the polarization of the nucleus @xmath0=3031% from that of the coma @xmath4=2930% taking account of the signal with different apertures ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "these two values are not necessarily the same , because we observe the scattered light from the coma dust grains in the former , while we observe the reflected light from a kilometer - sized body in the latter . as shown in figure [ fig : f4 ] , a comparison between observations performed in other comets indicates a lower trend for the coma polarizations of 209p .",
    "we may nevertheless underestimate the polarization degrees for the coma due to a very slight gas contamination .",
    "the polarization of the nucleus ( @xmath0 ) seems to show higher than the coma ( @xmath4 ) but the differences are insignificant to the accuracy of our measurement .",
    "figure [ fig : f6 ] compares the polarization degrees of the nucleus with those of asteroids at phase angles larger than about 60  from the asteroid polarimetric database @xcite .",
    "all asteroids in the database show polarization degrees remarkably lower than 209p .",
    "the phase - polarization curve of ( 4179 ) tautatis is well studied among these asteroids .",
    "@xcite determined the phase angle of the maximum polarization at @xmath59=107@xmath4010 .",
    "although we can not determine @xmath59 of 209p with our measurement , we conjecture that our polarimetric measurement was performed around the maximum polarization degree because both the s - type asteroid and cometary coma show the maximum values around the phase angle we measured . for a better understanding of the polarization properties of the nucleus and coma dust at large phase angles , we derived the @xmath8 using the lumme and muinonen function @xcite :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constant parameters . according to @xcite",
    ", parameters @xmath61 and @xmath64 affect the amplitude and slope of polarization and the inversion angle , and the other two parameters , the powers @xmath62 and @xmath63 , control shapes the phase curve .",
    "because the phase angle coverage of our data is limited , we first fit the phase - polarization relations for comets or asteroids , and then derived @xmath8 of 209p . therefore , assuming that the nucleus was essentially identical to low - albedo asteroids(@xmath510.1 ) , we deduced @xmath8 of the nucleus is 30.8% at @xmath59 of 96  with the fitted parameters @xmath61=34.81% , @xmath62=0.7838 , @xmath63=0.2400 and @xmath64=17.88 . for the coma , assuming that the fitted parameters @xmath62=0.7904 , @xmath63=0.2418 and @xmath64=21.59  for high - polarization comets and keeping @xmath61 as a free parameter , we deduced @xmath8 of the coma is 29.6% with @xmath59=98 .",
    "our @xmath8 values are higher polarization than other high - polarization comets and known airless bodies .",
    "it was suggetsed that the presence of jets and arcs in the ambient coma correlated with regions of higher polarization @xcite .",
    "however , according to @xcite , such structures were not identified for 209p .",
    "trends are shown as that are similar to the case with cometary nuclei split into fragments ( e.g. c/1999 s4 @xcite and 73p @xcite ) , whereas 209p is obvious without such an outburst .",
    "therefore the correlation between cometary activity and polarization excess are considered to be unsuitable for 209p .",
    "some physical properties such as grain size distribution and porosity @xcite may enhance the polarization degree of 209p , although we have no observational evidence to study these properties .",
    "asteroids show a similar trend of the phase - polarization relation having the maximum polarization at @xmath2=90120  @xcite but the polarization degrees of these asteroids are significantly lower than that of the 209p nucleus ( see figure [ fig : f6 ] ) .",
    "note that only a few asteroids including ( 1685 ) toro , ( 4179 ) toutatis ( 214869 ) 2007 pa@xmath65 were observed at large phase angles and they are classified as s - type asteroids .",
    "the s - type asteroids show very similar phase - polarization relations .",

    "the c - type asteroid shows large @xmath7 at @xmath6720 , although @xmath8 for c - type asteroids has not been determined yet .",
    "since s - type asteroids generally have albedos larger than those of c - type asteroids and e - type asteroids have albedos larger than others , it seems that @xmath8 for asteroids would have a correlation between albedo and @xmath8 .",
    "a slope of the linear region at the inversion angle @xmath68 ( as the solid line in figure [ fig : f6 ] shows ) was derived as 0.30%/@xmath400.01%/  from the phase - polarization curve .",
    "this polarimetric slope @xmath68 was slightly steeper than the mean value of c - type objects ( 0.282%/@xmath400.025%/ , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the relation between the geometric albedo @xmath9 and the slope @xmath68 has been found from the studies of the scattering properties @xcite , and is the following : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the constants .",
    "these recent values were presented as @xmath70=1.207@xmath400.067 and @xmath71=1.892@xmath400.141 by @xcite .",
    "the geometric albedo for the nucleus of 209p is calculated 0.05@xmath72 on these constraints , which are consistent findings for @xcite and 0.049@xmath400.020 as the average albedo of the potential dormant comets @xcite .",
    "this @xmath8albedo relationship has long been known as the umov law .",
    "since the effect is observed on the moon , mercury and mars , the umov law could essentially be applicable to asteroids and comets .",
    "the law is described as @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath9 is the geometric albedo .",

    "@xmath8 plot of 209p together with the umov function modified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the geometric albedo of 209p was unknown , so we adopted 0.05@xmath72 as the likely estimate from equation ( [ eq : pv - h ] ) .",

    "it is likely the albedo@xmath8 relation can be explained by the umov law .",
    "although the errors of albedos are too large to enable the regolith sizes on these bodies to be determined , we can safely say that our 209p data favours large ( @xmath781 ) particle sizes .",
    "submicron - sized particles were probably well accommodated by gas outflow and lost over time by repeated comet activities .",
