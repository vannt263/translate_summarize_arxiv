    "solar flares are sudden energy releases in the solar atmosphere caused by the magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the typical energy released by solar flares ranges from @xmath0 to @xmath1 erg .",
    "similar flares and larger `` superflares '' have been observed on various types of stars including solar - type stars ( g- and late f - type main sequence stars ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the recent space - based observations revealed that not only rapidly rotating and young solar - type stars but also slowly - rotating stars like our sun exhibit superflares with the bolometric energy of @xmath2 to @xmath3 erg , which are @xmath4-@xmath5 times larger than the energy of the largest solar flares .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of superflare stars show quasi - periodic light variations with the period and amplitude of @xmath6-@xmath7 days and @xmath8 % . by analogy with the time variations in the total solar irradiance due to sunspots ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the brightness variations of superflare stars are thought to be caused by the rotation of stars and the superflare stars have much larger starspots than our sun ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the energy released by superflares are basically a part of magnetic energy stored around starspots if we assumed that the magnetic energy can be estimated from the area of starspots and the starspot area corresponds to the amplitude of light variations .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopy of superflare stars ( @xcite ) revealed that projected rotation velocity @xmath9 of superflare stars is consistent with the rotation velocity estimated from the period of light variations .",
    "@xcite found that there is a clear correlation between the intensity of the chromospheric ca ii 8542    line and the amplitude of quasi - periodic light variations of superflare stars .",
    "these results suggest that the photometric variations of superflare stars are caused by the rotation of the star and the amplitude of brightness variations is a good indicator of the chromospheric activity .",
    "moreover , @xcite reported that superflare stars show higher intensities of the ca ii h and k lines than ordinary solar - type stars .",
    "this result indicates that superflare stars show higher magnetic activity than ordinary solar - type stars including our sun . since the existence of large starspots ( up to @xmath10 % of stellar hemisphere )",
    "is thought to be a key factor to produce superflares , it is important to investigate the statistical properties of large starspots ( e.g. , production rate and size distribution of starspots ) and their dependence on stellar properties ( e.g. , rotation period ) for the understanding of superflares . in this paper , we report ( 1 ) the relation between the flare activity and properties of starspots on solar - type stars , ( 2 ) the production rate and size distribution of starspots on solar - type stars , and ( 3 ) the comparison between the starspot - superflare connection on solar - type stars and the sunspot - solar flare connection on the sun .",
    "we selected solar - type stars ( early g- and late f - type main sequence stars ) from the kepler data set by using the effective temperature ( @xmath11 ) and the surface gravity ( @xmath12 ) of the star .",
    "the dynamo activity is thought to correlate with the stellar mass , which is related to the effective temperature , and rotation period of the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to compare the spot activity of the solar - type stars and that of the sun , we select the solar - type stars with the temperature similar to the sun . here",
    "we used the selection criteria of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the selection of solar - type stars .",
    "we also selected the stars exhibiting superflares from the flare star list in @xcite . in previous studies about superflares @xcite , we selected g- , k- , and m - dwarfs as the target of search for superflares by using stellar parameters in the original kepler input catalog @xcite .",
    "since the temperature and surface gravity of the stars taken from @xcite are slightly different from those in @xcite ( e.g. , systematic difference in effective temperature ) , some stars selected by using the above criteria are not included in the g - dwarf samples in @xcite . in order to avoid mismatch of the data caused by the difference in stellar parameters between @xcite and @xcite , we selected samples that fulfill the both criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xmath15 and @xmath14 in @xcite , which is the same criteria as those used in @xcite .",
    "the total number of samples is 64,239 .",
    "the typical length of observations to search for superflares is @xmath16 days @xcite .",
    "we used the data set of superflares detected by @xcite .",
    "however , since the effective temperature of the stars taken from @xcite is approximately 200 k higher than those from @xcite , we recalculated the bolometric energy of each superflare by using the stellar parameters taken from @xcite and the kepler pdc light curve ( dr24 ) .",
    "the bolometric energy emitted by each flare is estimated by time integration of the change in the stellar luminosity caused by the flare with the same manner as @xcite .",

    "the normalized amplitude of rotational light variation of the star ( @xmath19 ) with the apparent starspot area ( @xmath20 ) can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 indicates the apparent area of the star , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the temperature of unspotted photosphere of the star and starspot , respectively .",
    "the temperature difference between stellar photosphere and starspots depends on the photospheric temperature of the stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimated the temperature difference between photosphere and spots ( @xmath25 ) by using the following equation , @xmath26 which was derived from the second order polynomial fit to the data for all stars except for ek dra in table 5 of @xcite .",
    "the rms of residuals of the fit is @xmath27 k. therefore , from equation ( [ obs_amplitude ] ) and ( [ deltat ] ) , we can estimate the area of starspots normalized by the area of solar hemisphere ( @xmath28 ) as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is stellar radius in units of the solar radius .",
    "the equations ( [ obs_amplitude ] ) and ( [ spotarea ] ) are applicable only if ( a ) there are a few large spot groups on the surface of the star and ( b ) the lifetime of spots is much longer than the rotation period .",

    "as shown in figure [ solar_flare_sunspot_magnetic_class ] , both the flare frequency and the flare energy at the larger end of frequency - energy distribution of solar flares originated from the @xmath120-type spots are @xmath31-@xmath119 orders of magnitude lower than those from the @xmath118-type spots with the same spot area .",
    "if the correlation between the magnetic structure of large starspots and superflares on the solar - type stars is similar to that between the magnetic structure of smaller sunspots and solar flares on the sun , the large starspots with the simple ( @xmath120-type ) magnetic structure would produce less frequent and less energetic flares than the large starspots with the complex ( @xmath118-type ) magnetic structure . according to sunspot observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , majority of sunspot groups with large spot area are @xmath118-type sunspot group .",
    "the usaf / noaa sunspot data indicate that the fraction of @xmath118-type spot groups among the sunspots with the area of @xmath53-@xmath54 is approximately 92% .",
    "however , the small fraction of the stars with superflares among the stars with large starspots and longer rotation period ( figure [ flare_star_fraction ] ) suggests that if the difference in the flare activity of the stars with large starspots is caused by the difference in the magnetic structure of spots , the fraction of the @xmath118-type spots among the starspots with the area of @xmath136 on the solar - type stars would be lower than that among the sunspots with the area of @xmath137 .",
    "we need more detailed studies of the magnetic structure of large starspots on the stars with and without superflares .",
    "doppler imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) and zeeman doppler imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) techniques may help us to study the magnetic field geometry of the solar - type stars with large starspots and its correlation to the flare activity .",
    "the large starspots can cause the small fluctuations in the light curve of planetary transits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of the transit light curve with the future high photometric - precision and high time - resolution data ( e.g. , _ tess _ ; @xcite and _ plato _ ; @xcite ) may also be useful to reveal the difference in the structure of the starspot groups between the stars with and without superflares .",

    "as described in section 2 , we estimated the area of starspot groups from the amplitude of the rotational light variations under the assumption that observed light variations are caused by one or a few large starspot group(s ) . in the case of rapidly - rotating stars , the existence of the large starspots has been studied by using the light curve modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ) and doppler imaging technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , in the case of slowly - rotating stars , it is unclear whether the large amplitude light - variations are caused by a few large starspot groups or not . in order to check the assumption that light variations are caused by the large starspots , here we investigate the number of starspot groups on some of stars showing the light variations with large amplitude ( @xmath135 % ) and long period ( @xmath89 days ) .    in this analysis",
    ", we used a new simple method for identification of each starspot based on the rotational phase of local brightness minima in the light curve .",
    "the light curve of the rotating star with a starspot group shows a minimum brightness at the meridian passage of the spot during one rotation period .",
    "the time separation of each photometric minimum in the light curve is constant and equals to the rotation period . in the case of the star with two spot groups ,",
    "the light curve shows two local minima during the rotation period .",
    "the separation of the two local minima corresponds to the difference in longitudes between the two spots .",
    "moreover , if two spots are located at the different latitudes , the time separation of two local minima , which correspond to the the difference in longitudes between each spot group , changes in time due to the differential rotation of the star .",
    "figure [ spot_oc ] shows some examples of the light curves of slowly - rotating stars ( a , c , e , and g ) and the time variations of the rotational phase of local brightness minima ( b , d , f , and h ) .",
    "all of the stars shown in figure [ spot_oc ] are non - superflare stars .",
    "the vertical axis of figure [ spot_oc ] ( b , d , f , and h ) represents the rotational phase of each local minimum in the light curve .",
    "the phase of each minimum were calculated by using the rotation period of the star taken from @xcite .",
    "if a series of local minima are caused by the same spot group , the rotational phase of the local minima lie on a line on the phase - time plot until the spot group disappear .",
    "therefore , we can identify each starspot and can estimate the lifetime of starspots by using our method .",
    "the slope of the line corresponds to the difference in the apparent rotation period of the spot group due to the differential rotation .",
    "this indicates that we can also measure the differential rotation in the stars from the standard deviation of the mean slope in the phase - time plots . in figure [ spot_oc ] ( b ) , we can clearly see two series of the local minima between bjd 2455300 and 2455450 .",
    "this result indicates that there have been two major starspot groups on the surface of kic 8282807 during that period .",
    "if two or more spot groups are located at the same longitude , the amplitude of photometric variations would be large . as shown in figure [ spot_oc ] , the two different spots were located at almost the same longitude around bjd 2455500 and then the amplitude of photometric variations became large .",
    "this effect causes the overestimation of the area of starspots by using the equation ( [ spotarea ] ) .",
    "however , if the latitudes of each spot are not the same , the relative longitudes between each spots change in time and we can estimate the area of each spot group from the light curve .",

    "these results indicate that the typical lifetime of large starspot groups with the area of @xmath74 on solar - type stars is longer enough than the rotation period of the star . in the case of slowly - rotating stars ,",
    "the typical lifetime of large spots is the order of @xmath149 days , which is much longer than the lifetime of the typical sunspot groups ( @xmath150 days ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in section 4.2",

    "as described in section 2 , we used @xcite as the catalog of superflare stars .",

    "@xcite selected only flare stars showing @xmath157 flares during the kepler observations ( flare rate of @xmath164 events per year ) .",
