    "this paper is part of a program to found quantum gravity in relational topology ; more precisely , to replace point set topology with a special type of category as the underlying structure on which to put geometrodynamics .",
    "physically , the idea is that what we actually observe are interactions between bounded regions of spacetime .",
    "these could be either material systems or regions of empty space whose causal effects can be directly or indirectly distinguished by material systems .",
    "there should be a direct mathematical description of the flow of information between the regions , and points should appear only relative to an observer , as minimal distinguished regions .",
    "we will propose a specific axiomatic structure for a type of category which would contain the regions as objects and the relationships between them as different types of morphisms .",
    "the hope is that this would lead to a description of quantum physics free from ultraviolet divergences , by eliminating the underlying point set continuum .",
    "since categories as generalizations of topological spaces are well known in mathematics , where they are referred to as sites @xcite , we are calling our new structures causal sites . strictly speaking ,",
    "a site is a category together with a structure called a `` grothendieck topology , '' which is the analog of a topology for an ordinary space .",
    "we will explain below that our axioms also involve a structure very similar to a grothendieck topology .",
    "this paper will mainly discuss the `` topological '' side of the problem , i.e.  the structure of the causal sites themselves .",
    "we discover that , unlike manifolds , causal sites with suitable finiteness conditions have an intrinsic geometry .",
    "thus the distinction between topology and geometry is bridged over in our new picture .",
    "examples are described which reproduce the classical solutions to general relativity above the planck scale .",
    "we briefly consider the possibility of directly quantizing causal sites , thus directly producing a quantum theory of general relativity",
    ".    we will then briefly consider the appropriate classes of presheaves over causal sites , namely unitary and bisimplicial prestacks .",
    "we hope this can serve as a bridge between the topological aspects of causal site theory and the problem of constructing quantum physics over them .",
    "we will make some remarks as to how to construct a model for quantum gravity at the end .",
    "a very important feature of the topology of causal sites is that they have a tangent 2-bundle , which is analogous to the tangent bundle of a manifold .",
    "we believe this will serve as a setting for applications to quantum geometry and physics .",
    "the structure of causal sites is a synthesis of two constructions , one well known from homotopy theory and algebraic geometry , the other familiar in the relativity literature .",
    "a site  @xcite is a category thought of as a generalization of the lattice of open sets of a topological space , with a distinguished family of covers for objects .",
    "( we warn the reader that our construction does not fully conform to the accepted definition of a site , since the covers in it do not satisfy the axioms of a grothendieck topology , as explained below . )",
    "the morphisms of the category represent an abstract version of containment .",
    "doing sheaf theory over such generalized spaces is an important part of modern mathematics .    on the other hand ,",
    "a causal set  @xcite , or partially ordered set , is a discrete point set approximating the causal structure of a spacetime manifold .",
    "now , since up to this point nobody has tried to use sites as a foundation for relativity , the natural structure that occurs when we combine the two ideas has never been considered .",
    "we will show that it is surprisingly rich and elegant .",
    "since causal sets are well known as models for general relativity , let us mention some of their similarities and differences with causal sites .",
    "causal sites with a suitable finiteness condition have an intrinsic metric structure , as mentioned above .",
    "it is defined by counting the length of a maximal causal chain .",
    "this is quite similar to the intrinsic metric of a discrete causal set  @xcite .",
    "we believe the greater flexibility of the families of regions in a causal site will mean they give much better approximations to the geometry of spacetimes than causal sets do .",
    "there can be infinitely many regions intermediate between two given ones in a causal site , and yet causal paths can have a maximal finite length , as we show in examples below .",
    "while random causal sets which approximate minkowski space are believed to reproduce lorentz invariance in the infinite volume limit , examples of causal sites which approximate minkowski space have an invariance under germs of the lorentz group on bounded regions as well . as models for general relativity ,",
    "causal sites can be studied in many of the same ways as causal sets .",
    "mathematically , causal sites are a `` categorification '' of causal sets .",
    "the fundamental mathematical observation is that both the containment structure of a site and the causal structure of a causal set can be described as partial orders .",
    "as we will explain in section  [ se : simplicial ] , these two partial orders give rise to a natural bisimplicial set which we call the elementary classifying space of the causal site . from this point of view",
    ", certain collections of regions can be viewed as products of simplices , and these products are glued together in a well - defined way .",
    "we also construct another bisimplicial set , which we call the physical classifying space .",
    "this turns out to be a `` special '' bisimplicial set , a type of bisimplicial set which corresponds to a weak 2-category  @xcite .",
    "this means that causal sites fall into a class of structure which is already studied , and that the family of simplicial presheaves over it is well understood .",
    "we will argue at the end that this suggests an approach to doing quantum general relativity over causal sites , by putting state sum models on their tangent 2-bundles .",
    "this paper is meant to open a number of lines of research .",
    "the contents are as follows : in section 2 we present the axioms for a causal site and some simple consequences . in section 3",
    "we show how a causal site with suitable finiteness conditions can have an intrinsic geometry . in section 4 ,",
    "we briefly discuss quantization of sites and in section 5 we discuss the simplicial and bisimplicial structures inherent in a causal site . in section 6 ,",
    "we translate this into a bicategorical structure .",
    "sections 7 and 8 discuss the structure of the tangent spaces and tangent bundle , while section 9 discusses the general analog of a bundle for a causal site , namely a prestack . in sections 10 and 11",
    "we discuss how state sum models could emerge in a causal site .",
    "section 12 contains conclusions and outlook .",
    "we freely make use of terminology and ideas from category theory . in particular , we assume basic familiarity with weak 2-categories , which are also called bicategories .",

    "we are now going to axiomatize the structure of regions in a causal spacetime .

    "it is not hard to invent modifications of our examples which would have stronger finiteness conditions and still recover interesting geometrodynamics .",
    "for example , fix a discrete closed subspace @xmath116 of minkowski space and a discrete closed subspace @xmath42 of the hyperboloid of unit timelike vectors .",

    "such a model is computationally accessible , and is a good candidate for quantization , as discussed below .",
    "the discrete subspace @xmath116 of minkowski space could be chosen to be a random sprinkling of points , or a lattice . in a general manifold",
    ", @xmath116 would have to be an irregular collection of points .",
    "if the manifold is globally hyperbolic , then one again obtains a noetherian causal site .",
    "note that the use of fundamental diamonds is not crucial to any of the discussion in this section .",
    "one could use other shapes , such as `` fundamental cylinders , '' which are regions formed by working in normal coordinates and taking the cartesian product of a timelike interval of length 1 with a ball of radius 1 in the hyperplane orthogonal to the chosen timelike direction .    as yet",
    ", we do not know how to impose einstein s equation on a causal site purely intrinsically .",
    "a causal site can be thought of as a large number of answers to questions , either telling us one region is inside another , or that one region can observe another .",
    "the answers to these questions can be grouped together in certain good examples and reinterpreted as describing physically interesting geometries .",
    "it is therefore natural to reinterpret the statements that define a causal site as quantum observables and attempt to extract a quantum geometry from them .",
    "this could be a new avenue of attack on the problem of quantizing gravity .",
    "it is not hard to see how to begin such a program .",
    "we could tensor together a finite dimensional hilbert space for each pair of regions , and construct operators for containment and causal relatedness on each .",
    "the interesting part would be to see if suitable commutation relations could be found on the operators to reproduce einstein s equation in the classical limit , for suitable families of causal sites .",
    "we have not yet investigated this .",
    "we first remind the reader of the relationship between partial orders and simplicial sets .",
    "a good reference for simplicial sets is  @xcite .    roughly speaking , a simplicial set is a set of abstract simplices ( points , edges , triangles , tetrahedra , etc . )  with the faces of the simplices of dimension @xmath120 identified with simplices of dimension @xmath121 , thus gluing the simplices together into a combinatorial model of a space .",
    "the mathematically natural definition of a simplex includes an ordering of its vertices , and includes `` degenerate '' simplices in which some vertices are repeated .",
    "if @xmath122 is a simplicial set , we write @xmath123 for the set of @xmath120-simplices .",
    "associated to a given partially ordered set is a simplicial set which contains all of the information .",
    "an @xmath120-simplex of this simplicial set is a weakly ascending chain of length @xmath124 .",
    "the face maps come from omitting one member of the chain , and the degeneracies from repeating one member .",
    "since the regions of a causal site have two partial orders on them , they have a natural description as the vertices of a bisimplicial set . roughly speaking , a bisimplicial set is a collection of abstract cartesian products of pairs of simplices , with attachments along face maps corresponding to both simplicial factors separately .",
    "the product of a triangle with a tetrahedron , for example , has three faces which are edge @xmath125 tetrahedron , and four which were triangle @xmath125 triangle .",
    "if @xmath122 is a bisimplicial set , we write @xmath126 for the set of @xmath127-bisimplices .",
    "let us give an explicit description of the bisimplicial set of a causal site .",
    "an @xmath127-bisimplex is a family @xmath128 of regions in the site , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , such that if @xmath131 then @xmath132 or @xmath133 and if @xmath134 then @xmath135 . the two types of face maps come from omitting one value of @xmath136 or @xmath137 , and the two types of degeneracies from repeating items in the sequences .",
    "[ de : elem - class - space ] the bisimplicial set associated to a causal site above is called its elementary classifying space .",
    "note that if @xmath122 is any bisimplicial set , and we fix @xmath77 , then there is a natural simplicial set @xmath138 whose @xmath120-simplices are the @xmath127-bisimplices of @xmath122 .",
    "we call @xmath138 the simplicial set of @xmath77-simplices .",
    "it is now an important observation that the elementary classifying space of a causal site satisfies the segal condition  ( * ? ? ?",
    "ta ) , @xcite .",
    "the segal condition for a bisimplicial set has two parts",
    ". translated into our situation , the first part states that the simplicial set of @xmath77-simplices is the subset of the product of @xmath77 copies of the simplicial set of @xmath49-simplices , where the adjacent @xmath139-simplex objects are equal .",
    "more explicitly , it says that for each @xmath77 and @xmath120 , the natural map @xmath140 must be a bijection .",
    "this is true for the elementary classifying space , essentially because giving a chain @xmath141 is the same as giving @xmath120 chains @xmath142 , @xmath143 ,  , @xmath144 .",
    "the second part of the segal condition for bisimplicial sets is more subtle in general .",
    "the first part of the segal condition tells us that for each @xmath77 , the simplicial set @xmath138 can be regarded as a category .",
    "the second part of the segal condition then requires that for each @xmath77 , the natural map @xmath145 must be an equivalence of categories . in our case ,",
    "something stronger is true : for each @xmath77 and @xmath120 , the natural map @xmath146 is a bijection .",
    "the reason this is true is similar to the reason that the first part of the segal condition holds . and",
    "from this it follows that the categories above are equivalent .",
    "now let us describe the segal condition for a simplicial set @xmath7 .",
    "it simply states that there is exactly one @xmath120-simplex for each chain of @xmath120 @xmath49-simplices with the second vertex of the @xmath136th @xmath49-simplex equal to the first vertex of the @xmath147st .",
    "that is , it states that the natural map @xmath148 is a bijection .",
    "this is true , for example , for the simplicial set associated to any partially ordered set .",
    "we will explain the importance of this condition below , when we study the relationship with category theory .",
    "one point of all this is that we can completely capture the structure of a causal site as a combinatorially described space .",
    "this allows us to translate the problem of constructing physical theories on a causal site into the construction of presheaves over such a space , a problem which is well understood .",
    "another is to join the concept of causal sites to the field of higher category theory .",
    "now we need to construct a modification of the elementary classifying space of a causal site .",
    "the modification will allow us to associate to a causal site a `` special '' bisimplicial set ; see  @xcite , where it is referred to as axiom c1 , and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "ta ) .    a bisimplicial set @xmath122 is special if the simplicial set @xmath149 of @xmath139-simplices is a disjoint union of points .",
    "in other words , all of the face and degeneracy maps between sets of the form @xmath150 are bijections .",
    "this condition is important in category theory , because it is necessary for a bisimplicial set to be the nerve of a weak 2-category .",
    "as we shall see , this condition also plays a natural role when we try to construct models for quantum physical systems .",
    "now we want to define a new version of the classifying space of a causal site .",
    "the physical classifying space of a causal site is the bisimplicial set whose @xmath127-bisimplices correspond to the following data :    a sequence @xmath151 of regions with @xmath152 ;    for each @xmath153 and @xmath154 a causal path @xmath155 from @xmath115 to @xmath156 ;    such that for each @xmath136 and @xmath137 , the causal path @xmath157 is a refinement of @xmath158 .",
    "the two types of face maps are given by composition of rows and columns respectively .",
    "in this definition , refinements of causal paths play a central role . the physical motivation for this",
    "is the goal of writing discrete analogs of feynman path integrals , by summing effects of propagation along causal paths with the same beginning and end .",
    "mathematically , we will see below that the @xmath127-bisimplices of the physical classifying space fit together to form a weak 2-category , because the initial and final paths of a refinement share a common initial and final region .",
    "we would like to formulate the idea that all the information of a causal site is contained in its physical classifying space .",
    "we therefore make the following tentative definition :    a causal site is tractable if its elementary and physical classifying spaces are homotopy equivalent .",
    "we do not know which causal sites are tractable , or whether this will prove to be a useful way to formulate the idea that the physical classifying space `` suffices '' .",
    "the physical classifying space of a causal site is a special bisimplicial set satisfying the segal condition .",
    "the proof is similar to the argument given for the elementary classifying space , including the fact that a stronger form of the second part of the segal condition holds .",
    "thus , as we explain below , the physically natural idea of focussing on the causal paths of a causal site supplies the missing mathematical ingredient to replace a spacetime with a weak 2-category .",
    "we think this is suggestive for our program of applying higher categorical ideas of topology to quantum physics .",
    "there is a very strong connection between simplicial and multisimplicial sets and higher categories .",
    "we begin with a standard theorem about ( 1-)categories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between categories and simplicial sets satisfying the segal condition .",
    "the connection can be described by taking the nerve of the category .",
    "this is a simplicial set with one @xmath120-simplex for each string of @xmath120 composable morphisms in the category , with face maps given by compositions of pairs of adjacent morphisms and degeneracies given by inserting identity maps .",
    "this theorem has recently been extended from categories to 2-categories by tamsamani ( * ? ? ? * defn .",
    "ta ) , @xcite : he proved that there is a natural one - to - one correspondence between special bisimplicial sets satisfying the segal condition and weak 2-categories .",
    "the connection proceeds by taking the `` 2-nerve '' of the 2-category .",
    "this is the bisimplicial set with @xmath159-bisimplices the objects of the 2-category , @xmath160-bisimplices the 1-morphisms in the 2-category , @xmath161-bisimplices the 2-morphisms in the 2-category .",
    "a general @xmath127-bisimplex is a doubly indexed array of @xmath162 2-morphisms along with some additional data .",
    "the analogy with the structure of the physical classifying space prompts the following definition :    if the causal path @xmath163 is a refinement of the causal path @xmath164 then we say that there is a chain inclusion from the causal path @xmath165 to the causal path @xmath166 .",
    "the inclusion 2-category of a causal site is the 2-category whose objects are regions , 1-morphisms are causal paths , and 2-morphisms are chain inclusions .",
    "the inclusion 2-category of a causal site connects regions , processes between regions , and inclusions of processes .",
    "these are the elements which would go into a description of an experiment",
    ". a 2-functor on this 2-category would then give us a mathematical language in which to associate calculations to an experiment , by associating concrete mathematical structures and relations to the objects and processes .    as we shall discuss below",
    ", the state sum models for quantum gravity have a natural formulation in terms of 1- or 2-categories .",
    "any two 2-categories are connected by a 2-category of functors , natural transformations and modifications .",
    "this means the categorical structure we have described gives us a sort of calculus for constructing physical models over causal sites using the state sum models as local physical data .    to put things",
    "simply , one could easily feel that passing from point sets to regions led to a mathematical wilderness .",
    "the structure we have discovered has geometric , categorical and algebraic aspects which make available to us a large framework of definitions and theorems which can guide us to natural constructions of physical models .",
    "the natural definition of a physical model on a causal site is a type of functor on it .",
    "the definition could in principle be found without the categorical language , but it is a foolish cave explorer who throws away a light .",
    "the geometrical and physical applications of smooth manifolds largely grow out of the fact that to every smooth manifold we can naturally associate a tangent bundle .",
    "this develops from the more elementary fact that every point of a manifold has a neighborhood which can be described as a space of a fixed and familiar kind . in this section",
    "we propose such a neighborhood structure . in the next ,",
    "we show how to construct an analog of the tangent bundle , but a relational , or 2-categorical one .",
    "if @xmath7 is a region in a causal site , the bisimplicial set of regions contained in it is its bisimplicial patch .",
    "this bisimplicial set sits naturally inside the elementary classifying space ( definition  [ de : elem - class - space ] ) .    with this definition in place , it is possible to treat causal sites in a manner analogous to manifolds , by working on the local bisimplicial patches thought of as coordinate patches .",
    "simplicial and bisimplicial sets have a homotopy theory equivalent to the homotopy theory of topological spaces .",
    "this subtle mathematical fact should allow us to use the combinatorics of the bisimplicial patch as an approximation to the local topology of a region .",
    "let @xmath167 be regions .",
    "the bisimplicial patch of the complement is the bisimplicial set of regions @xmath7 which are contained in @xmath168 and disjoint from @xmath117 .",
    "the relative homotopy type of @xmath117 in @xmath168 means the homotopy type of the pair @xmath169 where @xmath122 is the bisimplicial patch of @xmath168 and @xmath170 is the bisimplicial patch of the complement of @xmath117 in @xmath168 .",
    "a region @xmath117 is an @xmath120-ball if it is contained in a region @xmath168 such that the relative homotopy type is that of an @xmath120-sphere .",
    "a causal site is a grained @xmath120-manifold if every region is contained in a union of a finite number of @xmath120-balls .",
    "in a physical model on a causal site , we would like to think of information being transferred along causal paths .",
    "we will now describe a construction of a version of a tangent bundle for causal sites in which the regions contain just such information as can be observed along the causal paths , while the compositions and inclusions of causal paths have a natural action .      for @xmath10",
    "we define @xmath171 to be the set of causal paths from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . for any @xmath58",

    "the past cone @xmath182 is a minimum element of @xmath183 .",
    "the relevance of these cones is that if @xmath184 , then @xmath185 for any @xmath8 .",

    "similarly , @xmath188 implies that @xmath189 for any @xmath7 .",
    "writing @xmath190 for the poset @xmath191 of all future cones and @xmath192 for the poset @xmath193 of all past cones , this says that @xmath194 is an order preserving map from the poset @xmath195 to the poset @xmath196 of sets and inclusions . in fancier language , @xmath194 is a functor .",
    "this has various consequences .",
    "for example , if @xmath55 , then @xmath197 and so @xmath198 for any @xmath8 . and if @xmath53 , then @xmath197 and so again @xmath198 for any @xmath8 .",
    "similar reasoning shows that if @xmath57 or @xmath199 ( note the reversal ! ) , then @xmath200 and so @xmath201 for any @xmath7 .",
    "if we are given a causal path @xmath44 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , we can assign to any pair of subregions @xmath55 and @xmath57 the set @xmath202 of causal paths from @xmath54 to @xmath86 which are refinements of @xmath44 .",
    "as above , this defines a functor , in this case from @xmath203 to @xmath196 .",
    "we next describe a 2-category which is a natural target for this construction .",
    "define a weak 2-category @xmath204 in the following way .",

    "note that the composites @xmath216 and @xmath217 of 1-morphisms are in general not equal .",
    "instead , there is a natural bijection between them .",
    "thus @xmath204 is a _ weak _ 2-category .",
    "this also explains why the 2-morphisms allow arbitrary injections rather than just inclusions .",
    "the horizontal and vertical compositions of the 2-morphisms of @xmath204 are given by cartesian product and composition of injections , respectively .",
    "the coherence of @xmath204 is natural .",
    "the discussion above can be summarized by saying that there is a weak 2-functor from the inclusion 2-category of our causal site to the weak 2-category @xmath204 .",
    "this can be thought of as a prestack .",
    "it sends a region @xmath7 to the pair @xmath218 of posets .",
    "it sends a causal path @xmath44 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 to the functor @xmath219 from @xmath203 to @xmath196 .",

    "if @xmath44 is a causal path from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and @xmath93 is a causal path from @xmath8 to @xmath16 , there is a natural injection @xmath222 , where @xmath223 denotes the composite of @xmath44 and @xmath93 .",
    "we call this weak 2-functor the tangent 2-bundle of the causal site .",
    "the tangent 2-bundle contains information about how causal paths can link the observable tangent spaces together .",
    "since we can also refine causal paths , expansions into discretized path sums will be possible by decomposing intermediate regions into unions and summing over the families of refined paths which occur .",
    "we think the analogy between smooth manifolds and causal sites may be a good guide to applications .",
    "we use the tangent bundle as a setting in order to apply calculus to the geometry of manifolds .",
    "similarly , the local simplicial or bisimplicial structures on a site may enable us to apply the calculus of categorical state sums to quantum geometry on them . in constructing a quantum theory over a causal site",
    ", it should be possible to use the connecting complexes as discretized analogs of a feynman path integral , and their 2-categorical structure should help constrain such a construction , allowing us to find interesting models just from the requirement of 2-functoriality .",
    "in the next few sections , we investigate a more conventional approach to constructing geometrical or physical models on causal sites , namely , putting suitable presheaves and prestacks over them .",
    "we will begin with a preliminary investigation of the type of physical model which the mathematical structure of a causal site suggests .",
    "we will not attempt to construct specific physically realistic models in this paper .",
    "the original idea of a site was motivated by the fact that a presheaf over a topological space @xmath122 is equivalent to a contravariant functor from the category of open subsets of @xmath122 .    since a bundle , including the tangent bundle of a manifold ,",
    "can be regarded as a type of sheaf , we have a language for describing analogs of the basic structures underlying yang - mills theory and general relativity available for sites , although we will probably need stronger regularity assumptions to be able to create more precise analogs .",
    "it is interesting that including a causal structure in our model , which traditionally is expressed by changing from a riemannian to a lorentzian metric , is expressed here by passage from a 1-category to a 2-category , a process which has been called categorification  @xcite .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that rather than looking for models over a causal site within an ordinary category , such as the category of hilbert spaces , we must turn to a 2-category , such as the category of 2-hilbert spaces @xcite . instead of a presheaf of hilbert spaces , we work with a prestack of 2-hilbert spaces .",
    "a prestack is a weak 2-functor from our causal site to a 2-category  @xcite . in a prestack",
    ", a triangle of restriction morphisms only needs to commute up to a 2-morphism .",
    "this means that rather than thinking of an assignment of a single hilbert space to a region ( something like the space of quantum states propagating through it ) , we assign to it a category of hilbert spaces .",
    "physically , we can think of this as related to the idea that the state space of a region has dimension related to the area of its boundary , so that if the geometry is itself a quantum variable , then the hilbert space itself can not be unique .",
    "indeed , if we tried to construct a physical theory over a causal site , we would quickly discover that we could nt find a natural linear map to associate to containment , because of the nonlocal correlations in quantum theories .",
    "we would be trapped trying to map pure states to mixed states .",
    "it actually provides an interesting new slant on the interpretation of quantum mechanics rewriting this process in terms of the different choices of hilbert spaces in the categories corresponding to two regions , one of which contains the other .",
    "let us explain in a very simple situation , using the category 2-vect @xcite rather than 2-hilb , how this would look .",
    "objects in 2-vect are @xmath120-vector spaces , i.e.  the category of all @xmath120-tuples of vector spaces for some @xmath120 .",
    "arrows in 2-vect are functors defined by tensoring by some column of vector spaces .",
    "thus , a ( contravariant ) functor from a causal site to 2-vect would find the vector spaces which could appear on a subregion being combined into tensor products of vector spaces associated to a larger region .",
    "now there is neither a natural map @xmath224 nor @xmath225 , so there would be no way to represent inclusion as a map on individual hilbert spaces .",
    "this is a mathematically elegant way to express the existence of nonlocal correlations in compound systems in quantum mechanics .",
    "the overall rule which tells us how the different hilbert spaces associated to regions are related has an elegant functorial form , which can not be recovered on the individual hilbert spaces . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar problem was studied for models on causal sets , and it was discovered that maps between causally related points had to be expressed as completely positive maps on spaces of mixed states ( i.e. , hermitian operators over the hilbert spaces , rather than the hilbert spaces themselves ) .",
    "the setting we are exploring , combining both causality and containment , should contain examples of this , but set in a broader algebraic context .",
    "now we can ask ourselves which of the models which have appeared in mathematical physics would be good candidates for extending to a causal site .",
    "an obvious choice would be 2-yang mills theory  @xcite , which is a theory which puts a nonlinear partial differential operator on a 2-form , by analogy with the yang - mills equation on a 1-form .",
    "since 2-yang mills theory has the interpretation of physics on the curvature of a gerbe , which is really a special type of stack of categories , it will have a direct generalization to causal sites .",
    "categorical state sums are models of quantum geometry on simplicial complexes@xcite .",
    "they are constructed out of unitary representations of lie groups or quantum groups , intertwining maps of these representations , and in some cases , 2-intertwiners .",
    "the maps are composed in closed patterns related to the combinatorics of the simplicial complex , traced , and summed over .",
    "the result is a discrete version of a path integral for quantum geometry , with the unitary representations acting as hilbert spaces on which geometric quantities are represented as operators .",
    "for example , in the model of @xcite , we have a four - dimensional simplicial complex . the 2-simplices ( triangles )",
    "are labelled with unitary representations of the lorentz group .",
    "we think of these as quantizations of the oriented area elements a geometry would assign to the faces , because oriented area elements can be identified with elements of the lie algebra of the lorentz group .",
    "in fact , in order to impose the necessary constraints on the geometry , we restrict ourselves to a class of representations called the balanced ones .",
    "we then label the tetrahedra with a sum over the balanced intertwining maps between the four representations , trace over each 4-simplex , multiply , then sum over all possible choices of representations .",
    "there are a number of models of this type , differing by the dimension , choice of symmetry group , constraints , etc .",
    "these amount to different choices of the geometry to be quantized .",
    "this type of model is closely related to the ideas discussed above describing simplicial sets as categories .",
    "they can be written as sums of functors from the category associated to the complex to the category of representations of the geometrical symmetry group or quantum group .    in short ,",
    "the categorical state sum picture makes it natural to assign a quantum geometry to a simplicial complex .    in the context of causal sites ,",
    "this can be thought of as a candidate for local quantum geometry on a tangent space , analogously to the use of inner products on tangent spaces in classical riemannian geometry .",
    "one of the reasons that manifold theory was so important to the development of relativity was that it gives a natural concrete expression for the equivalence principle : laws must be expressed in tensor form .",
    "the categorical underpinning of the structure of causal sites suggests a similar principle in quantum gravity : laws must be expressed in functorial form .",
    "this simple and attractive principle will cut down the possibilities greatly .    given that we already have subcategories which express the relational world seen by an observer , it is also a natural expression of the idea behind the equivalence principle , if we take the point of view that coordinate systems are idealized observers .",
    "the physically interesting examples of section  [ se : geometry ] all possess local symmetries .",
    "( since a bounded region which is boosted too far no longer contains fundamental cylinders , a mathematical formalization of this would need to use actions of germs of the lorentz or poincare groups .",
    "we will not work this out in this paper . )",
    "it therefore seems that the hilbert spaces in a quantum site would group together in unitary representations of the lorentz group .",
    "now one of the great challenges for our proposal is to find a way to derive einstein s equation as a classical limit for some formulation of the dynamics on a quantum site .",
    "categorical state sum models are interesting , because the laws of combination of the representations produce a classical limit which implies einstein s equation . in other words , einstein s equation",
    "is actually determined by the symmetry of the model , expressed in the tensor category of unitary representations of the lorentz group .",
    "now is it possible that we can introduce categorical state sum models into a suitable family of causal sites with local symmetries ?",
    "let us try to imagine how that could arise .",
    "in order to define a class of causal sites which would be physically realistic near the planck scale , we have defined `` grained worlds '' above as locally noetherian , amply pointed causal sites .",
    "we think of this as a way to embed facts about the limited amount of information which can flow between regions in general relativity into the fabric of spacetime itself .",
    "the combination of these two properties means that given a causally related pair of regions @xmath10 , we can find a finite set of relational points for @xmath8 in @xmath7 which in some sense exhaust the information which @xmath8 can see in @xmath7 .",
    "this would mean that the relational tangent space would be adequately described by a simplicial set , assuming the set of points did not contain one another .",
    "this suggests that the state sum model of @xcite , or some similar model , might appear as a good approximation to the quantum theory of the part of a quantum site contained in a region .",
    "this is probably a better setting for state sum models than direct application to a whole universe , since the finiteness of the simplicial set becomes better motivated .",
    "then , when we wanted to express the flow of information from one region , described by a state sum on a simplicial set , to another , along a given causal path , we would know that the map which described it would have to behave well when we included one causal path in another .",
    "this includes the information flow law in a 2-categorical structure , which might be rich enough to allow us to determine it .",
    "so a program suggests itself , to make a suitable set of assumptions on a prestack over a grained world , so that if we pass to a set of relational points the relative position information ends up containing all the transferred information , and takes the form of a state sum model .    at this point",
    ", we realize that our new point of view is making us ask a series of new questions about state sums which had no motivation in the past when they were thought of as stand alone models .",
    "we need to express the relationship between two state sum models when the complex of one is embedded in the other , we need to work out expressions for causal flows of information between state sums , and we need to investigate in what sense they approximate points with quantum variables between them as they grow far apart . if nothing else , the causal sites proposal has widened our perspective on state sum models .",
    "we now have defined a new class of mathematical objects , which are not point sets , but which can function as a topological foundation for classical general relativity .",
    "we have families of examples corresponding to classical spacetimes , which include descriptions of the geometrodynamics of classical spacetimes above the planck scale , without the inclusion of a metric tensor as a mathematical datum separate from the underlying spacetime structure .",
    "the representation of geometry by a causal site is analogous to the representation by a discrete causal set , but as we have discussed , it seems to give a much closer approximation .",
    "our relative and absolute points should not be confused with ordinary points , either in manifolds or causal sets .",
    "they are not `` atomic . '' for example , a union of a finite family of fundamental diamonds in a lorentzian manifold can contain an infinite number of other fundamental diamonds . nevertheless , the causality relationship between them gives rise to a finiteness or discreteness in the structure .",
    "it therefore makes a bridge between continuous and discrete structures in a new way .",
    "the hypothesis of overlapping minimal regions seems more physically natural to us than the discrete point sets of causal sets or categorical state sum models .",
    "it also means that the continuous or discrete symmetry properties of a causal site can be more robust than a causal set . in the examples we have constructed ,",
    "the symmetry with respect to the lorentz group is not broken , because we have fundamental diamonds in all reference frames . in the theory of causal sets , by contrast , it is only possible to recover the symmetry on the average in the infinite volume of minkowski space  @xcite . the fact that we are able to produce a mathematical construction which combines a fundamental graininess with symmetry in local regions gives our construction added interest .",
    "we think it will be interesting to try to find further families of examples , for instance to try to construct quantum @xmath120-manifolds neither related to causal sets nor directly derived from manifolds .",
    "different classes of these might give new examples of `` spacetime textures , '' which could be explored as new settings for physical models .",
    "it may well be that the physical intuition expressed in the phrase `` spacetime foam '' can find better expression in our setting that when constrained by the necessity of considering only families of smooth manifolds .",
    "causality and time are integrated into the mathematical structure of a causal site in a striking fashion : spacetime appears as a categorification of space .",
    "the fact that causal sites can be considered either as bisimplicial sets or as 2-categories means we have a number of well - understood tools at our disposal for constructing examples .",
    "we have , at this point , many more questions than answers .",
    "can the geometric picture of example  [ ex : lorentz - diamond ] be generalized to more intrinsic models , i.e.  models which have definitions not so directly dependent on a classical spacetime ?",
    "can it be quantized ?",
    "since it seems natural to approach quantization by beginning with the family of containments of a particular causal site , it will be easier to find semiclassical states in this approach than in other approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "it would seem that the hilbert spaces arising from quantization of a causal site with local symmetries would decompose into unitary representations of the lorentz group .",
    "do the state sum models arise in such a picture ?",
    "we should remind ourselves that einstein s equation is almost determined by symmetry considerations .",
    "would a quantization of a causal site with lorentz symmetry which was required to respect the symmetry be nearly determined as well ?      general relativity is intimately bound up with our ideas about spacetime and geometry .",
    "changing the foundation of these creates a situation in which all the questions of classical and quantum relativity can be reexamined .",
    "the large family of accessible examples we have constructed means that a fairly broad program can be practically implemented .",
