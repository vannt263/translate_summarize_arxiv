    "graphene_as the first one - atom - thick crystal whose honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms imposes gapless , massless and chiral dirac spectrum on its low - energy quasiparticles  has swiftly ignited intense experimental and theoretical studies of its unusual electronic transport properties  @xcite .",
    "the `` first wave '' of such studies  @xcite has been largely focused on explaining conductivity measurements at small bias voltage applied to large - area graphene samples as a function of carrier density , temperature and magnetic field .",
    "these studies have typically relied on simplistic model hamiltonians .",

    "panel ( d ) also shows some of the possible currents that flow in such _ multiterminal _ geometry , where the focus of our study is on currents like @xmath4 flowing between gnr and cnt . ]",
    "what could be termed the `` second wave '' of studies of electronic transport in graphene has been largely focused on confined structures ( such as nanoribbons and nanoflakes  @xcite ) , functional graphene - based devices ( such as transistors  @xcite and _ pn _ junctions  @xcite ) and novel state variables ( such as pseudospin in mono- and bi - layer graphene , real electronic spin , wavefunction phase  @xcite , and properties of correlated many - body quantum states like exciton condensates  @xcite ) .",
    "the greatest roadblock to continued scaling of conventional silicon electronic for digital applications is the power dissipated in various leakage mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the quantum coherent transport regime and novel state variables in graphene offer a prospect for revolutionary device designs that go beyond traditional ( silicon or carbon ) field - effect transistors ( fets ) based on classical physics .",
    "for example , exploiting them would make possible to switch current off without utilizing energy barrier of traditional fets , thereby evading thermal limitations in the subthreshold regime  @xcite .",
    "concurrently , recent advances in nanofabrication and surface science have pushed the attention towards more complex structures of `` second generation graphene ''  @xcite , such as chemically modified graphene ( i.e. , graphene sheets where carbon atoms are replaced by other atoms or entire functional groups ) or three - dimensional systems based on the assembly of graphene sheets ( where they form interconnected networks or highly complex nanoobjects like hollow nanospheres , crumpled paper , and capsules ) .",
    "another route involves creating hybrid nanostructures which combine flat graphene sheets with previously amply explored carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) that can be viewed as rolled up sheets of graphene .",
    "for example , the recent experiment  @xcite has created aligned graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) arrays by unzipping of aligned single - walled and few - walled cnt arrays .",
    "then , novel gnr - gnr and gnr - cnt crossbars were fabricated by transferring gnr arrays across gnr and cnt arrays , respectively .",
    "the production of such ordered architectures may allow for large scale integration of gnrs into nanoelectronics or optoelectronics .",
    "we note that the crossbar geometry has been explored over the past decade using typically semiconductor nanowires , such as those made of si or gan  @xcite , as well as crossed cnts  @xcite .",
    "such motif offers high device density and efficient interconnects between individual devices and functional device arrays , while a reconfigurable crossbar structure allows for effective incorporation of defect - tolerant computing schemes  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to vigorous experimental studies of nanowire crossbars , little theoretical guidance in designing such nanoelectronic devices has been offered by quantum transport simulations .",
    "for example , recent studies of gnr - gnr crossbars have utilized semi - empirical tight - binding model  @xcite or extended hckel model  @xcite with their parameters fitted to density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "these models are then coupled to nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) formalism  @xcite to compute the zero - bias transmission function  @xcite , or even current at finite bias voltage  @xcite .",
    "while such approaches can capture charge transfer between different atomic species in equilibrium , they fail to capture more complicated charge redistribution due to nonequilibrium steady transport state driven by the applied bias voltage . on the other hand ,",
    "the self - consistency of nonequilibrium charge and the corresponding electrostatic ( hartree ) potential are indispensable in order to satisfy the gauge - invariant condition according to which _",
    "characteristics should not change when electric potential everywhere is shifted by a constant amount  @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art approach that has emerged over the past decade and which can capture both charge transfer in equilibrium and charge redistribution in nonequilibrium is negf - dft  @xcite .",
    "virtually all widely used negf - dft scientific codes , such as commercial atk  @xcite and nanodcal  @xcite or open source transiesta  @xcite , smeagol  @xcite , alacant  @xcite , and gpaw  @xcite _ can handle only devices with two electrodes _ ( gpaw can also simulate multiterminal quantum transport but only in the linear - response regime  @xcite ) .",
    "here we overview the recent extension  @xcite of negf - dft framework to treat nanojunctions whose active region is attached to more than two electrodes , and then apply it to gnr - cnt crossbars illustrated in fig .",
