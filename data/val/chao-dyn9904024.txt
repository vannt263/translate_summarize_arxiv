    "the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath0 advected in a turbulent velocity field @xmath1 is of practical relevance in many fields of current research such as air pollution or chemical reactions in the stratosphere in connection with the ozone hole @xcite . especially for problems in atmospheric physics , models of two - dimensional turbulent flows give a good approximation of the dynamical processes and are frequently used@xcite .",
    "more recently , two - dimensional turbulence has become experimentally accessible in mercury layers@xcite , thin salt water layers@xcite , and soap films@xcite .",
    "two - dimensional turbulence is also interesting because of its fundamentally different behavior compared to the three - dimensional case . since the enstrophy is a second inviscid invariant beside the energy two cascades develop : starting from a fixed , intermediate injection scale , energy is transported to larger spatial scales in an inverse energy cascade and to smaller ones in an enstrophy cascade@xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior of a passive scalar in a turbulent fluid was analyzed mainly in three dimensions where three different regimes could be identified . depending on the reynolds number of the underlying fluid turbulence and the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the scalar diffusivity one distinguishes the viscous - convective batchelor regime@xcite , the inertial - convective regime@xcite , and the inertial - diffusive regime . in 2-d",
    "the situation is more complicated , since already the velocity field shows a variety of scaling regimes . in particular ,",
    "the inverse cascade process gives rise to the formation of large scale vortices that change on very slow time scales only @xcite and can dominate the dynamics of the passive scalar , at least on intermediate time scales @xcite .",
    "the formation of coherent vortices can be suppressed by a large scale dissipation mechanism .",
    "if this additional dissipation is present a statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow field develops , that can be characterized by its structure function .",
    "we assume that a passive scalar in such a flow field also develops a statistically stationary state which can be characterized by its own structure function .",
    "the approach used to analyse the structure function of the passive scalar is geometric measure theory @xcite .",
    "this powerful method allows to connect the structure function of the passive scalar to that of the underlying flow field and thus to link the statistical behavior of both .",
    "the result are scale resolved bounds on the scaling behavior .",
    "upper bounds are easiest to derive and often give very good results , see e.g. the favorable comparison between theory and numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "the derivation of lower bounds is possible@xcite but much more difficult and will not be attempted here . so assuming the reliability of the upper bounds we would like to see how the different regimes in @xmath9 are reflected in the scaling properties of the scalar field passively advected by the flow .",
    "some aspects of the 2-d case have been discussed previously @xcite , see below .",
    "in addition , we would like to compare the predictions to the results of experiments of cardoso _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where certain discrepancies to theory were noted . as we will see the discrepancies can be accounted for if the experimentally measured structure function is substituted for the velocity field .",
    "the model we consider is that of a scalar field @xmath0 transported in the turbulent flow field @xmath1 according to @xmath10 @xmath11 denotes the diffusivity . the force density @xmath12 models external boundary conditions and the driving and assures a statistically stationary field @xmath0 .",
    "the scalar @xmath13 is assumed to be _ passive _ , i.e. it does not affect the dynamics and the statistical properties of the velocity field .",
    "we assume that in the presence of a large scale dissipation mechanism a homogeneous , isotropic , and stationary turbulent state develops .",

    "we obtain @xmath5 from fourier transform of an energy spectrum as is found in many numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec_resu ] the fractal dimension of the passive scalar graph is derived over a broad range of prandtl numbers , both in the enstrophy inertial subrange ( isr ) and in the energy isr with the previous relations for the structure function .",

    "et al._@xcite , and some remarks on open questions .",
    "from now on all considerations are made for the case of a two - dimensional flow field .",
    "the graph of the scalar field is then a 2-d surface in 3-d space .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of this graph is obtained from the scaling behavior of the hausdorff volume @xmath24 of the graph @xmath25 over a disk of radius @xmath26 ( the 2-d ball @xmath27 ) @xcite , @xmath28 in two dimensions the fractal dimension @xmath29 is connected to the scaling exponent @xmath30 , cf .",

    "they also satisfy the inequality @xmath50 which changes to @xmath51 in the two - dimensional case .",
    "@xmath49 can be estimated as @xmath52 where the scalar dissipation rate @xmath53 , the enstrophy dissipation rate @xmath54 , and stationarity are used . in the case of a three - dimensional passive scalar",
    "this term contains a factor @xmath55 and thus can be neglected . in 2-d the smallest scales",
    "are given by the enstrophy dissipation rate and this factor disappears .",
    "hence @xmath49 can not be neglected ; its importance is evidently controlled by prandtl number @xmath7 , length scale @xmath26 and dimensionless prefactor @xmath56 the term @xmath48 can still be neglected on account of its subdominant scaling in @xmath26 .",
    "we introduce dimensionless length scales @xmath57 by means of the enstrophy dissipation length @xmath58 since in 2-d turbulence it is the enstrophy cascade that brings the energy to the smallest scales where viscosity dominates .",
    "it follows from ( [ vol1 ] ) for @xmath47 by applying the gauss theorem and the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath59 the quantity @xmath60 is the circumference .",
    "it is possible to add @xmath61 , the velocity at the center of @xmath27 , due to the assumed homogeneity .",
    "the first term on the right hand side contains the square root of the passive scalar flatness .",
    "since we are interested in the scaling properties of @xmath47 , it suffices to know that the scalar flatness is a constant , independent of @xmath26 .",
    "however , there do not seem to be numerical or experimental data for the passive scalar flatness in 2-d .",
    "data for the velocity field from the experiments @xcite and the numerical simulations @xcite suggest gaussian behavior in the absence of coherent structures in the regime of the inverse cascade .",
    "more recent experiments suggest that this result also extends into the region of the direct enstrophy cascade @xcite .",
    "however , since there are models where a gaussian statistics for a random velocity field causes non - gaussian scalar statistics @xcite , this information is insufficient to infer gaussian statistics for the passive scalar . in the following",
    "we will work with the gaussian flatness value of three for the passive scalar .",
    "it should be kept in mind that deviations from this value will most likely be scale dependent and will give rise to modifications of the scaling exponents .",
    "the second term is the longitudinal velocity structure function @xmath62 .",
    "thus we find @xmath63 combining ( [ scal ] ) , ( [ vol1 ] ) , ( [ i3eq ] ) , and ( [ i1 in ] ) we end up with an inequality for the fractal dimension @xmath64 of the passive scalar graph in two dimensions , @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "this inequality , relating the scaling exponent @xmath64 to the longitudinal structure function of the underlying turbulent flow field @xmath67 is the main result of this section . for most of the discussion that follows we will assume equality in ( [ fracdim ] ) ; in the three - dimensional case this is a very good assumption @xcite .",
    "to evaluate ( [ fracdim ] ) we need information on the scaling behavior of the 2nd order longitudinal structure function @xmath68 .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath62 and transversal structure function @xmath69 make up the velocity structure function @xmath5 and are connected by incompressibility , @xmath70 .",
    "eliminating the transversal part then gives @xcite @xmath71 as there are two inertial ranges with several different scaling regimes , there is no analytical expression for the structure function .",
    "as far as we are aware , the best that can be achieved analytically is the structure function for the enstrophy cascade as discussed by grossmann and mertens@xcite .",
    "they used a mean field type approach for the fully developed , turbulent velocity field in the enstrophy cascade , i.e. for spatial scales @xmath72 .",
    "separating small and large scales one finds energy and enstrophy balance equations where terms resulting from the small scale fluctuations act like an effective eddy viscosity for the large scale components of @xmath73 .",
    "analytical expressions for the 2nd order vorticity structure function @xmath74 and the 2nd order velocity structure function @xmath5 can be found using the batchelor interpolation technique@xcite . in dimensionless form",
    "they read    @xmath75    2 with the parameter @xmath76 and the asymptotic value @xmath77 .",
    "this spectrum also depends on the energy dissipation @xmath78 , which when expressed in the length and energy scales of the enstrophy cascade becomes the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the structure functions are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "besides the prominent @xmath80 behavior that follows already by dimensional analysis one notes an intermediate scaling with @xmath81 ; the range over which this scaling is observed depends on @xmath82 ( see below ) . the corresponding longitudinal velocity structure function @xmath83 is given with eq .",
