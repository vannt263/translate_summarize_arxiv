    "recently , investigations of the fermi surface ( fs ) have been a crucial issue in the study on the high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite have found evidences of deviations from conventional fermi liquid demonstrating the existence of the pseudogap formation above @xmath3 in the single - particle spectral function and the breakdown of the fs at the so - called `` hot - spot '' region in the brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi surface is an important physical property which characterizes the low temperature behavior of the normal phase of fermion systems .",
    "if the stability of the fermi liquid state is verified , the luttinger theorem @xcite concerning the conservation of the fermi surface volume holds .",
    "however , if the interacting fermion system is in a state close to some instability , the precise definition of both the fermi liquid and the fs may become uncertain .",
    "some indications of the deviations from the conventional fermi surface behavior have already been seen in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite indicated the change of the fs topology for small hole dopings in the strong coupling regime .",
    "this topological change is characterized by the fs closing around @xmath4 despite the ( small ) hole dopings . in the weak coupling regime of the hubbard model , using second order perturbation theory , zlati , schotte , and schliecker @xcite obtained that the fs changes its topology due to the self - energy effects for small dopings . in contradiction with that , within the same framework of perturbation theory , halboth and metzner @xcite have shown that the modification of the fs is very small for weak coupling at zero temperature .",
    "thus , even in the weak - coupling regime , the fs of the hubbard model leads to controversy .    in this paper , we focus on the modification suffered by the fs of the 2d hubbard model near the antiferromagnetic instability in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "the 2d hubbard model produces several different electronic phases according to the choice of the parameters . for the highly doped case , the system is in the conventional fermi liquid regime with a well - defined fs . on the other hand , in the ground state at half - filling ,",
    "the system becomes an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "thus , for an appropriate set of parameters , the zero temperature phase transition will take place , and quite probably , the conventional fermi surface picture is lost before that .",
    "however the long range antiferromagnetic order at half - filling is automatically destroyed at sufficiently high temperatures or finite doping .",
    "thus , assuming paramagnetic background at finite temperature we use itinerant approaches such as the second order perturbation theory , the paramagnon theory@xcite and also the recently developed two - particle self - consistent approach@xcite to calculate the effects produced on the fs .",
    "varying the electron concentration , the coupling constant and the temperature , the single - particle spectral function is calculated in all those approaches . in general the fs is well defined for a normal metal at @xmath1 . at finite temperature , however , we can not define the fs sharply . to describe the counterpart of the fermi surface at finite temperatures , we introduce the spectral function @xmath0 at the fermi level .",
    "the meaning of this quantity is discussed in detail .",
    "we will see that the fs of the hubbard model at finite temperature shows remarkable modifications .",
    "as we approach the antiferromagnetic instability condition , the fs is destroyed at the @xmath5 regions in the brillouin zone .",
    "the calculated effective band dispersion indicates that the anisotropic pseudogap and the destruction of the fs are both manifestations of the precursor of the antiferromagnetic instability at half - filling . besides that",
    ", we note that there is a trace of the fs in the pseudogap regime in which there is no effective band dispersion crossing the fermi level .",
    "also , by varying the electron number per site @xmath6 , we find that the spectral function and self - energy clearly show a crossover from the fermi liquid regime at the smaller @xmath6 to the pseudogap regime near the half - filling .",
    "we start with the standard 2d hubbard hamiltonian defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbor transfer matrix on the square lattice , @xmath9 is the on - site repulsive coupling constant , @xmath10 the chemical potential and @xmath11 .",
    "the fermi surface can be determined using the single - particle spectra which is calculated with the full green s function . the spectral function @xmath12 is given in terms of the imaginary part of the retarded green s function : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a proper self - energy which is given in the following subsection .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath10 is determined to be consistent with a given electron concentration @xmath6 which satisfies @xmath18 for fixed values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the fermi distribution function defined by @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "next , we introduce self - energies for three different approaches ; the paramagnon theory@xcite , the second order perturbation theory , and the two - particle self - consistent approach@xcite .",
    "the paramagnon theory ( pt ) is probably the simplest way to take account of the magnetic instability in the electronic states qualitatively . in that approach",
    ", the divergence of the spin susceptibility in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) signals the antiferromagnetic instability . at @xmath1 , due to the perfect nesting condition , the real part of the one - loop polarization bubble @xmath23 diverges , and the pt approach can not be simply applied .",
    "@xmath24 is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the chemical potential in the non - interacting case . at non - zero temperature",
    ", however , @xmath23 remains finite even at half - filling .",
    "thus , the rpa spin susceptibility does not diverge for suitable small values of the coupling constant @xmath9 and the system remains in its paramagnetic regime .",
    "we perform all calculations in the present paper with suitable choices of the temperature @xmath28 , the coupling constant @xmath9 , and the electron concentration @xmath6 . a zero - temperature version of our approximation has been used by kampf@xcite to calculate the spectral function of the doped hubbard model .",
    "one drawback of the paramagnon theory is that it does predict the antiferromagnetic instability in two dimensions violating in this way the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "however , if we avoid this transition regime by working at finite temperatures , as we have shown in our previous work@xcite , this approach gives the qualitatively correct non - fermi - liquid energy dependence in the self - energy with the corresponding anisotropic pseudogap in the single - particle spectral function .",
    "these results are in general agreement with several other approaches@xcite .",
    "moreover , the anisotropy of the pseudogap , which has been observed also in the qmc simulation by creffield et al @xcite , was shown in our previous paper .",
    "to derive the self - energy , we use the standard diagram technique by treating the interaction term perturbatively . since the hartree - fock term @xmath29 is nothing but a constant energy shift , we include it in the chemical potential .",

    "the hartree - fock term has been absorbed again in the chemical potential .",
    "note the difference of the factor @xmath44 of our definition of @xmath24 here from the one in their original papers .",
    "the renormalized coupling constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 are determined by solving the self - consistent equations given by @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the average double occupancy per site .",
    "note that contrary to the other two methods the mermin - wagner theorem is satisfied at any finite temperature in the tpsc approach @xcite . to review it briefly ,",
    "let s consider the half - filling case . at half - filling , from eqs .",
    "( [ sc3 ] ) and ( [ sc1 ] ) , we obtain the following self - consistent equation to compute @xmath45 : @xmath51 if @xmath45 always satisfies the condition @xmath52 , the magnetic instability is not realized , namley the mermin - wagner theorem holds .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the above self - consistent equation in terms of two functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 and @xmath56 the self - consistent equation ( [ sc ] ) is equivalent to the relation @xmath57 .",

    "@xmath53 diverges as @xmath58 approaches @xmath61 .",
    "this divergence was proved by vilk and tremblay @xcite .",
    "the intersection of @xmath53 and @xmath54 gives the solution of the self - consistent equation .",
    "from the plot , we see that the intersection point always stays within the range @xmath62 for arbitrary @xmath9 .",
    "namely , the solution of the tpsc self - consistent equation never violates the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "let s consider how to obtain the information on the fermi surface from the full green s function given by eq .",
    "( [ deqf ] ) at finite temperature .",
    "so far , several different methods to investigate the fs have been used in the literature .",
    "one straightforward way to define the fs is given by the quasiparticle poles of the green s function through the solutions of @xmath63 .",
    "another way is to use the electron momentum distribution function @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 . in this case , the fs is characterized by each @xmath66 point associated with a finite discontinuity of @xmath64 .",
    "those definitions give a proper fs at zero temperature .",
    "however , at finite temperature , since the imaginary part of the self - energy has a finite value with a non - trivial @xmath66 dependence in general , these definitions are not applicable .",
    "another definition is to use @xmath67 .",
    "this is not useful to apply for the pseudogap regime since this condition is always satisfied at half - filling and at finite temperature .",
    "maximum slope of @xmath68 is also used in the determination of the fs obtained with the angle - resolved photoemission @xcite . however , because @xmath64 is obtained from a quantity which is integrated over the energy , it has a maximum slope even if a gap or a pseudogap exists . at finite @xmath28 the fs",
    "is often defined approximately by the @xmath66 points at which the effective band dispersion crosses on the fermi level .",
    "the effective band dispersion is obtained from the maximum intensity points of the spectral function .",
    "strictly speaking , at finite temperature we can not define a sharp fs because of the broadening effects in the spectral function .",
    "however , in principle , the fermi level can be calculated for any sets of parameters of the system if the number of electrons is known .",
    "we therefore use this route to establish the fermi surface . taking into account the above consideration on the fs , instead of employing conventional definitions",
    ", we consider the electron distribution at the fermi level .",
    "such distribution can be represented by a single - particle spectral function written as @xmath69 ^ 2   + [ { \\rm im}\\sigma({\\bf k},0)]^2}.   \\label{ak0}\\ ] ] it is evident that it satisfies a sum - rule @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level .",
    "@xmath0 contains all the information of the single - particle states at the fermi level and possesses enough information to study the properties of the fermi surface .",
    "we easily see that @xmath0 has the following features , which covers the basic properties of the conventional fs .",
    "when the system is described by the conventional fermi - liquid at zero temperature , we have that @xmath72 and the peak points of the delta - function trace a sharply defined fs in the @xmath66 space .",
    "thus , @xmath0 recovers the conventional fs at the ground states . in a fermi liquid at finite temperature ,",
    "the spectral function becomes broad around the fermi level .",
    "quite naturally , @xmath0 covers this feature because it has a finite width and it draws a broad trace in the @xmath66 space . on the other hand , when the system does not have a spectral weight at all at the fermi level ( @xmath73 )  for instance , an insulating state with a real gap ",
    "@xmath0 is identically zero for all wave vectors .",
    "thus , @xmath0 represents all cases ranging from the well - defined fs to the vanishing fs limit . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 can be used to trace the evolution of the fs in all cases . observed fermi surface in angle - resolved photoemission experiments",
    "is extracted from the finite weight of the single particle spectra in the vicinity of the fermi level . here too , in this respect , it is meaningful to introduce @xmath0 in order to study the fs structure .",
    "as we see from the argument above , the generalized fs at finite temperatures is no longer strictly speaking a _ surface _ in the momentum space .",
    "it is not clear if it could be used as the counterpart of the @xmath1 fs .",
    "this issue could be solved by analogy with what happens to the band dispersion in both non - interacting and interacting systems .",
    "the electronic states in the free - fermion system in a lattice is completely described by a non - interacting band dispersion @xmath74 . in the interacting system , within certain theoretical treatment of the interaction term",
    ", the spectral function @xmath12 contains all the information of the single - particle states , but the ( effective ) band dispersion can not fully describe the electronic states .",
    "the fs of the non - interacting system is given by @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 at the fermi level continues to carry all necessary information concerning the electronic states . as a result it replaces the band dispersion in the description of the electronic states in the interacting system . in the following section of this paper , we use the term , fermi surface , in this extended sense .",
    "using the self - energies and the green s functions presented in the previous section , numerical calculations were performed in the same manner as in our previous work@xcite .",
    "a mesh of about 4000 grids in the first brillouin zone has been used to compute the momentum integral to obtain the imaginary parts of both charge and spin susceptibilities .",
    "a @xmath76 mesh on the brillouin zone has been used to perform the momentum integrations for the self - energies to obtain the green s functions and the spectral functions .      in fig .",
    "[ dos2nd ] we show the temperature dependence of dos calculated using the second order perturbation theory for @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    ". detailed analyses of the self - energy and the single - particle spectra at finite temperatures and finite dopings have already been done by zlati , grabowski , and entel @xcite .",
    "a main temperature dependence in dos appears only around the fermi level ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we do not see any pseudogap - like structure in dos in this approximation . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the maximum of dos at the fermi level is broad . for a lower temperature @xmath81 ,",
    "this maximum becomes a sharp peak .",
    "figure [ fs2nd ] shows the gray - scale density plot of @xmath0 for the corresponding parameters used in fig .",

    "a well - defined fs has been obtained .",
    "the broadening in the plot for @xmath80 ( upper panel ) can be understood as the temperature effect in the self - energy .",
    "thus , within our results , the second order perturbation theory gives the conventional fermi - liquid - like behavior both in the single - particle spectra and in the fs .",
    "namely , this approach does not explain the breakdown of the fermi surface .",

    "the strong low - energy antiferromagnetic stoner enhancement in the spin susceptibility produces the non - fermi - liquid energy dependence in the fermion self - energy .",

    "@xmath9 becomes large , the distribution becomes broad and the fs can not be sharply defined .",
    "the tendency for broadening is remarkable in the @xmath5 regions .",
    "the original structure of the spectral function around @xmath5 is almost washed out for @xmath90 .",
    "instead , there is a hollow structure centered on @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath89 regions have relatively large intensities .    in fig .",
    "[ disppt ] we show the effective band dispersion obtained from the main peaks of the spectral functions @xmath91 for the same parameter as the lower panel in fig .  [ fsu ] .",

    "this result is consistent with the earlier investigations of the single - hole motion in the 2d antiferromagnetic background@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ disppt ] it is important to realize that the effective band does not cross the fermi level . in conventional meaning",
    "we can not define the fs in this regime , but the spectral weight remains at the fermi level and it forms a very broad remnant fermi surface structure in the momentum space as we see in the lower - most panel of fig .",
    "[ fsu ] .",
    "figure [ tpscfs ] shows the plot of @xmath0 in the tpsc for @xmath77 at half - filling for @xmath80 ( upper panel ) and @xmath92 ( lower panel ) . despite the above mentioned difference between the tpsc and pt ,",
    "both approaches show qualitetive agreement with respect to the destruction of fs .",
    "the quantitative diffference between the two methods is due to the fact that in the pt case the interaction effects are overestimated by the lack of vertex corrections .    in fig .",
    "[ tpscdos ] we show the temperature dependence of dos @xmath93 in the tpsc approach for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "the fs region near @xmath5 becomes very unclear , while the other fs sectors remain relatively well - defined .",
    "again , this indicates the anisotropic breakdown of the fermi liquid picture on the fermi level .    in fig .",
    "[ tpscspc ] we plot the spectral functions and the self - energies for various electron concentrations for @xmath96 and @xmath77 . for convenience ,",
    "the momentum @xmath99 has been assumed to be the same one in the @xmath100 direction on the non - interacting fermi surfcae for each @xmath6 . at @xmath85 , the spectral function ( a )",
    "has a single peak at the fermi level .",
    "this peak corresponds to the conventional fermi liquid quasiparticle . as",
    "increasing @xmath6 towards half - filling , the peak becomes broader and shifts into the @xmath101 side . on the other hand",
    ", a shoulder appears in the @xmath102 side in the spectral function ( @xmath88 ) and in the end this turns into another peak .",

    "imaginary ( c ) parts of the self - energy show those fermi liquid like behaviors .",
    "as @xmath6 becomes larger , the self - energy dramatically changes its @xmath104 dependence and indicates deviations from the fermi liquid nature .",
    "there are two remarkable features at @xmath95 : ( i ) the @xmath104 dependence of the real part of the self - energy resembles to the spin - density - wave self - energy ( @xmath106 ) , ( ii ) the large negative peak appears in the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "we find that the second order perturbation theory fails to show the breakdown of the fermi surface .",
    "the decisive difference between the second order perturbation and the other two approaches is the fact that in the former case the stoner factor is not taken into account in the self - energy .",
    "we can immediately see this by comparing the definitions of these self - energies .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the stoner enhancement is important to produce the anomalous energy dependence in the self - energy .",
    "if it is combined with the flat - band dispersion the anisotropic pseudogap is formed in the spectral function .",
    "because of this difference in self - energy , the second order perturbation theory fs is well defined and does not show any anomaly even for dopings close to half - filling .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 there has been some controversy concerning the fermi surface topology in the 2nd order perturbation theory framework@xcite .",
    "this issue was recently discussed by halboth and metzner ( hm ) in @xcite .",
    "we just want to add that in our calculation we pay attention to the existence of different values of chemical potentials for the non - interacting green s function and the interacting green s functions which is renormalized by the self - energy effects .",
    "if one uses a fixed value of chemical potential in both cases the conservation of electron number is automatically destroyed .",
    "this will in turn produce discrepancies for any finite doping .",
    "this does not seem to be taken into account in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we discuss next the possibility of the small hole pocket formation in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "et al _ @xcite and schmalian_et al _ @xcite , using the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation for the hubbard model , have investigated how the low - energy electronic states and the fs evolve at finite dopings .",
    "they explained@xcite one scenario of the formation of the small hole pockets produced by the transfer of the spectral weight from the main band to the shadow band . in the range of the parameters used in our calculation ,",
    "we have not obtained any sign of the hole pockets or even the `` shadow '' of the fermi surface @xcite , while we observed the segments of the shadow bands in the effective band dispersion . according to the argument in ref .  , the origin of the shadow band is a large imaginary part of the self - energy at the @xmath107 regions rather than another pole in the single - particle green s function . in their result the imaginary part of the self - energy has a strong momentum dependence .",
    "that feature has been seen also in our previous calculation@xcite . however , the momentum dependence of @xmath108 produces the anisotropy of the pseudogap in @xmath12 . in both pt and tpsc approach , the origin of the double - peak",
    "is clearly associated with the real poles of the full green s function .",
    "because of this difference , it is natural that our data showed neither the shadow of the fs nor the hole - pockets .",
    "chubukov and morr@xcite have shown the small hole pocket formation in an analytical investigation based on the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid approach for the spin - fermion model .",
    "et al _ @xcite have also obtained the small half - pocket - like segments in the fs for the spin - fermion model .",
    "although both the pt and tpsc approaches are in a different approximation level from their semi - phenomenological model , the importance of the spin - fluctuation is common in both approaches . to compare with their results we need to study the @xmath8-@xmath109-@xmath9 hubbard model@xcite which has the same non - interacting band dispersion including the next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath109 and to use the fermi surface topology as they used . if the same mechanism discussed in the present paper works in the @xmath8-@xmath109-@xmath9 model , we can expect to obtain a half closed small fs around the @xmath89 point .",
    "the single - particle spectrum of the @xmath8-@xmath110 model is equivalent to that of the hubbard model in the strong coupling limit if we take no consideration of the upper hubbard band effect .",
    "recently , dai and su @xcite obtained the destruction of the fs of the @xmath8-@xmath110 model , and the fs for a hole doping clearly shows a topological change of the fermi surface which is consistent with the results of the qmc simulations in the large - coupling hubbard model@xcite .",
    "putikka , luchini , and singh@xcite also showed the violation of the luttinger theorem in the @xmath8-@xmath110 model .",
    "in the present work which deals with the weak - coupling hubbard model , we can not make any decisive statement concerning the validity of the luttinger theorem although the complete fs structure no longer exists . at half - filling in the arbitrary coupling ,",
    "the hubbard model acquires the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "hence , presumably the half - filling fermi surface ( if it exists ) can not show any anomalous topology . as it is well known , in the large coupling regime , the doped hubbard model have a preformed gap associated with the mott - hubbard transition .",
    "the energy scale of the preformed gap is of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "the qmc simulations have shown that the doped hole forms a narrow quasiparticle band dispersion on the top of the lower hubbard band@xcite .",
    "namely , there is a jump of the fermi level between the infinitesimal hole and electron dopings .",
    "this discontinuity of the fermi level produces the deviation of the electron - hole symmetry in the electronic states . in the weak - coupling regime , since the effect of the preformed gap at finite temperatures is considerably weak , the electronic states must preserve the electron - hole symmetry for an infinitesimal doping , and the topological change can not be seen .",
    "thus , the topology change of the fs in the large coupling regime may be a manifestation of the effective violation of the electron - hole symmetry due to the large preformed gap .    in conclusion",
    ", we studied the electron distribution @xmath0 at the fermi level for the 2d hubbard model in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "this quantity is useful for the generalization of the conventional fermi surface concept and can be applied in all circumstances for all ranges of parameters of the hubbard model at finite temperature .",
    "we examined three different itinerant approaches , and found that the second order perturbation theory fails to describe the breakdown of the fermi surface . in the pseudogap regime",

    "<S> a precursor effect on the fermi surface in the two - dimensional hubbard model at finite temperatures near the antiferromagnetic instability is studied using three different itinerant approaches : the second order perturbation theory , the paramagnon theory ( pt ) , and the two - particle self - consistent ( tpsc ) approach . in general , at finite temperature , the fermi surface of the interacting electron systems is not sharply defined due to the broadening effects of the self - energy . in order to take account of those effects we consider the single - particle spectral function @xmath0 at the fermi level , to describe the counterpart of the fermi surface at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fermi surface is destroyed close to the pseudogap regime due to the spin - fluctuation effects in both pt and tpsc approaches . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the top of the effective valence band is located around @xmath2 in agreement with earlier investigations on the single - hole motion in the antiferromagnetic background . a crossover behavior from the fermi - liquid regime to the pseudogap regime </S>",
