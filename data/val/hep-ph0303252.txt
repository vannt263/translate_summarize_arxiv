    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments reveal that neutrinos have small but finite mass differences @xcite .",
    "the precise observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) shows that not only the mass differences , but also the masses themselves , are small @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino mass is naturally explained in the seesaw mechanism @xcite with right - handed neutrinos and in the zee model with radiative mass generation @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the zee model , which has many predictions for low energy physics .",
    "this model has two higgs doublets and a singlet higgs scalar field ( the zee singlet ) , in addition to the fields in the standard model . in the original zee model , both of the two higgs doublets couple to the ordinary matter fields .",
    "wolfenstein , however , imposed a discrete symmetry on the zee model so that only one of the two higgs doublets couples to the ordinary matter fields . as a result , dangerous processes through the flavor changing neutral current ( fcncs ) are easily avoided in this model , and this simplified model has been mainly considered so far @xcite .",
    "we call this model the restricted zee model ( rzm ) @xcite",
    ". one of the attractive points of the zee model in this version is that the bilarge mixing angle pattern , with respect to the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , is naturally explained .",
    "this attractive feature , ironically , has forced the zee model into a difficult position very recently .",
    "the predicted large angles must be just around @xmath0 @xcite and are incompatible with the large mixing angle ( lma ) mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution with @xmath1 , while the kamland experiment reports that only the lma msw solution is allowed @xcite .",
    "several ideas have been proposed to escape from this difficulty : introducing a fourth neutrino @xcite , introducing a doubly charged higgs scalar field @xcite , introducing triplet higgs scalars @xcite , and allowing both of the two higgs doublets to couple to the ordinary matter fields .    aside from the difficulty concerning the solar mixing angle",
    ", we have another issue with this model in cosmology .",
    "since the lepton number is violated in this model , the primordial baryon number is washed out through the sphaleron process at quite a low temperature @xcite .",
    "this model therefore seems to be unable to exist together with baryogenesis scenarios in which the baryon number is produced at a high temperature .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that there exists an approximately conserved number @xmath2 for the low mass , low probability ( low ) and vacuum oscillation ( vo ) solutions of the solar neutrino problem in the rzm , and complete baryon number washing out does not occur @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the original zee model in which both of the two higgs doublets couple to the ordinary matter fields .",
    "we call this model the general zee model ( gzm ) in order to clearly distinguish it from the rzm @xcite .",
    "although this model was proposed earlier , it has not been extensively discussed , as we mentioned above .",
    "we shed light on the gzm once again and find not only that the two phenomenological problems above can be avoided but also that the gzm can be consistent with experiments involving fcncs .",
    "this model is attractive in the sense that the extension from the rzm , of which properties have been extensively discussed , is minimal .",
    "although the extension is minimal , many undetermined parameters arise and the investigation in the full parameter region is very difficult .",
    "we then constrain the structure of the neutrino mass matrix obtained from the zee model .",
    "two constraints for the neutrino mass matrix have been proposed : imposing a texture to have two independent zeros in the base , where the masses of the charged leptons are diagonalized @xcite , and requiring the mass matrix to have a vanishing determinant @xcite . while the vanishing determinant constraint is good in that the condition does not depend on the weak base we take , and it is suitable for an investigation into the zee model with a doubly charged higgs singlet @xcite , it does not fit the structure of the mass matrix obtained from the zee model considered here .",
    "we therefore employ the two - independent - zero - texture constraint , of which phenomenological aspects were investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . the suitable two - zero - texture mass matrix for the zee model considered here is the case c defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath3 the main aim of the present paper is to search for the simplest gzm with this structure of the mass matrix , which is compatible with the lma msw solution of the solar neutrino problem and free from the baryon number washing out .",
    "it turns out that such a gzm can be constructed by minimal extension from the rzm , i.e. , by adding only one coupling constant to the rzm .",
    "we also examine whether this model is allowed from the viewpoint of experiments : @xmath4(@xmath5 ) decay rate , @xmath6 @xcite and neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",

    "we next derive the majorana neutrino mass matrix that is induced through the radiative correction in the gzm .",
    "the parameters of the gzm are determined by comparing the structure of the neutrino mass matrix obtained from the experiments with that obtained from the gzm . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the cosmological implication of the gzm . from the viewpoint of baryogenesis , there must be some combinations of the lepton numbers that avoid the washing out of the primordial baryon number .",
    "we first examine what combinations of lepton numbers are conserved in each type of gzm .",
    "we next obtain a range of parameters in which the baryon number is not washed out .",
