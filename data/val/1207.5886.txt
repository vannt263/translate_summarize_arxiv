    "observations of distant type ia supernovae ( snia ) and cosmic microwave background anisotropy have shown that the present universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "this expansion may be driven by a component with negative pressure , called dark energy .",
    "the simplest model of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath2 which can fit the observations in a fair way @xcite , whose equation of state is @xmath3 during the evolution of the universe .",
    "however there are two serious problems with cosmological constant model , namely the fine tuning and the cosmic coincidence @xcite .",
    "to solve these problems different dynamic dark energy models have been proposed , with varying equation of state during the expansion of the universe .",
    "holographic dark energy ( hde ) is one among them @xcite .",
    "hde is constructed based on the holographic principle , that in quantum gravity , the entropy of a system scales not with its volume but with its surface area @xmath4 , analogically the cosmological constant in einstein s theory also is inverse of some length squared .",
    "it was shown that @xcite in effective quantum field theory , the zero point energy of the system with size @xmath5 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , thus @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the quantum zero - point energy and @xmath8 , is the reduced plank mass .",
    "this inequality relation implies a link between the ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off , defined through @xmath7 and the infrared ( ir ) cut - off encoded in the scale @xmath9 in the context of cosmology one can take the dark energy density of the universe @xmath10 as the same as the vacuum energy , i.e. @xmath11 the largest ir cut - off @xmath5 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so that the holographic energy density can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is numerical constant . in the current literature , the ir cut - off has been taken as the hubble horizon @xcite , particle horizon and event horizon @xcite or some generalized ir cut off @xcite .",
    "the hde models with hubble horizon or particle horizon as the ir cut - off , can not lead to the current accelerated expansion @xcite of the universe . when the event horizon is taken as the length scale",
    ", the model is suffered from the following disadvantage .",
    "future event horizon is a global concept of space - time . on the other hand density of dark energy",
    "is a local quantity .",
    "so the relation between them will pose challenges to the concept of causality .",
    "these leads to the introduction new hde , where the length scale is given by the average radius of the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath14    the holographic ricci dark energy model introduced by granda and oliveros @xcite based on the space - time scalar curvature , is fairly good in fitting with the observational data .",
    "this model have the following advantages .",
    "first , the fine tuning problem can be avoided in this model . moreover ,",
    "the presence of event horizon is not presumed in this model , so that the causality problem can be avoided .",
    "the coincidence problem can also be solved effectively in this model . recently",
    "a modified form of ricci dark energy was studied @xcite in connection with the dark matter interaction , and analyses the model using _ om _ diagnostic . in this paper",
    "we have considered the evolution of the universe in modified holographic ricci dark energy ( mhrde ) model and obtain the statefinder parameters to discriminate this model with other standard dark energy models .",
    "statefinder parameters is a sensitive and diagnostic tool used to discriminate various dark energy models .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath15 and deceleration parameter @xmath16 alone can not discriminate various dark energy models because of the degeneracy on these parameters .",
    "hence sahni et al .",
    "@xcite introduces a set of parameters @xmath17 called statefinder parameters , defined as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor of the expanding universe and @xmath20 is the total energy density containing dark energy , energy corresponds to curvature and also matter ( we are neglecting the radiation part in our analysis ) . in general statefinder parameter",
    "is a geometrical diagnostic such that it depends upon the expansion factor and hence on the metric describing space - time .",
    "the @xmath0 plot of dark energy models can help to differentiate and discriminate various models .",
    "for the well known @xmath2cdm model , the @xmath0 trajectory is corresponds to fixed point , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the cosmological behavior of various dark models including holographic dark energy model , were studied and differentiated in the recent literature using statefinder parameters @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we have studied the cosmological behavior of the mhrde model and in section 3 we have considered the statefinder diagnostic analysis followed by the conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the universe is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the co - moving coordinates , @xmath25 is the curvature parameter with values , @xmath26 for closed , flat and open universes respectively and @xmath27 is the scale factor , with @xmath28 is taken as its present value .",
    "the friedmann equation describing the evolution of the universe is @xmath29 where we have taken @xmath30 , the summation includes the energy densities of non - relativistic matter and dark energy , i.e. @xmath31 . the modified holographic ricci dark energy can be expressed by taking the ir cutoff with the modified ricci radius in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath32 is the time derivative of the hubble parameter , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are free constants , the model parameters .",
    "chimento et .",
    "al . studied this type of dark energy in interaction with the dark matter with chaplygin gas @xcite , but our analysis is mainly concentrated on the cosmological evolution of mhrde and analyses with statefinder diagnostic . substituting the dark energy density as the mhrde in the friedmann equation , and changing the variable form cosmic time @xmath37 to @xmath38 we get @xmath39 introducing the normalized hubble parameter as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the hubble parameter for @xmath43 ,",
    "the above equation become , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the current density parameter of non - relativistic matter ( we will take 0.27 as its values for our analysis throughout . ) with current density @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the present relative density parameter of the curvature .",
    "we will consider only flat universe , where @xmath48 in our further analysis .",

    "the pressure corresponding the dark energy can be calculated as , @xmath53 e^{-3\\beta x}\\ ] ] form the conservation equation , we can obtain the corresponding equation of state parameter for the flat universe , using equation ( [ darke1 ] ) as , @xmath54 e^{3(1 - \\beta ) x }             \\over             ( \\alpha - 1 ) \\omega_{m0 } +   \\left [ ( 1-\\beta ) - ( \\alpha            - \\beta ) \\omega_{m0 } \\right ] e^{3(1 - \\beta ) x } } \\right\\}\\ ] ] this equation of state implies the possibility of transit form @xmath55 to @xmath56 corresponds to the phantom model @xcite for suitable model parameter values .",
    "recent observational evidences shows that the dark energy equation of state parameter can crosses the value -1 @xcite . in a universe dominated with mhrde , where the contribution from the non - relativistic matter behavior term is negligible in the dark energy density ,",
    "the equation state parameter become , @xmath57 so if @xmath36 is less than zero , the equation of state can crosses the phantom divide . in the far future of the universe , when redshift @xmath58 also , the equation of state parameter reduces to the form given in equation ( [ reducedeos ] ) .",
    "so the behavior of the dark energy is depending strongly on the model parameter @xmath59     with redshift @xmath60 for the best fit values @xmath61 and @xmath62 _ _ ]    we have plotted the evolution of the equation of state parameter of mhrde with redshift in figure [ fig : eos1 ] , using the best fit values of the model parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 as @xcite @xmath63 and @xmath64=0.27 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath65 of dark energy shows that in the remote past of the universe , that is at large redshift , the equation of state parameter is near zero , implies that the dark energy behaves like the cold dark matter in the remote past .",
    "the plot also shows that at far future of the universe as @xmath66 the equation of state parameter approaches a saturation value .",
    "the present value of the equation of state parameter according to this plot is negative , and is around @xmath67 +     and @xmath36 _ _ ]    for other values of the model parameters @xmath68 @xcite as ( @xmath69 = ( 1.01 , 0.05 ) , ( 1.01,0.1 ) , ( 1.2,-0.05 ) , ( 1.2,-0.1 ) , ( 4/3,0.1 ) and ( 4/3 , -0.1 ) the behavior of the equation of state parameter is given figure [ fig : eos ] .",
    "for a given value of @xmath35 the saturation value of @xmath65 in the future universe decreases as @xmath70 shows that irrespective of the values of the parameters @xmath71 the equation of state parameter is negative at present times implies that the present universe is accelerating , and also in the remote past at high redshift @xmath72 indicate that mhrde behaves like cold dark matter in the past stages of the universe . for negative values of @xmath36 the equation of state parameter crosses -1 , in that case it can be classified as quintom @xcite dark energy and for the case @xmath73 the universe will evolve into a phantom energy dominated epoch @xcite .        in figure",
    "[ fig : densityevolve ] , we have shown a comparison of the evolution of non - relativistic matter density and mhrde density in logarithmic scale . here we have neglected phase transitions , transitions from non - relativistic to relativistic particles at high temperatures and new degrees of freedom etc .",
    "it is expected that these would not make much qualitative difference in the result .",
    "the plot shows that in the present model the densities of non - relativistic matter and dark energy were comparable with each other in the past universe that is at high redshift .",
    "the acceleration began at low redshifts , which solves the coincidence problem .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath16 for the mhrde model can obtained using the relation @xmath74 this equation can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath49 as @xmath75 using equation ( [ hsquare ] ) the above equation can be written as @xmath76 ( 3\\beta - 2 ) e^{-3\\beta x }         \\over         2 \\left [ \\left ( { \\alpha - \\beta \\over 1 - \\beta } \\right ) \\omega_{m0 } e^{-3x }         + \\left ( { ( \\alpha - \\beta ) \\omega_{m0 } \\over \\beta -1 } + 1 \\right )          e^{-3\\beta x } \\right ] } \\ ] ] this equation shows the dependence of the deceleration parameter on the model parameters @xmath35 and @xmath59 as an approximation , if we neglect the contribution form the first terms in both numerator and denominator ( since they are negligibly small ) the deceleration parameter will become @xmath77 which shows , as @xmath36 increases form from zero , the parameter @xmath16 increases form -1 , that is the universe enter the acceleration phase at successively later times .     for the best fit model parameters @xmath35=1.01 and @xmath36=0.15 _ _ ]        in figure [ fig : deceleration1 ] and figure [ fig : deceleration ] we have plotted the evolution of the deceleration parameter with redshift .",

    "the plots shows that at large redshift , the deceleration parameter approaches 0.5 .",
    "the universe is entering the acceleration in the recent past at @xmath78 the plot also shows that as @xmath35 increase , the entry to the accelerating phase is occurring at relatively lower values of redshift , that is the universe entering the accelerating phase at relatively later times as the parameter @xmath35 increases .",
    "the transition of the universe from deceleration to the accelerating phase is occurred at the the redshift @xmath79 , for the best fit model parameters . for comparison",
    "the combined analysis of sne+cmb data with @xmath2cdm model gives the range @xmath80 = 0.50 - 0.73 @xcite .",
    "for taking consideration of the entire model parametric range , the transition to the accelerating phase can be obtained , as in figure [ fig : deceleration ] as @xmath81=0.50 - 0.76 .",
    "the comparison of the two ranges shows that in the mhrde model the universe entering the accelerating expansion phase earlier than in the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the present value of the deceleration parameter for the best fit model parameters @xmath35=1.01 , @xmath36=0.15 is @xmath82 as from figure [ fig : deceleration1 ] .",

    "equation ( [ statefinder ] ) for @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be rewrite in terms of @xmath85 as , @xmath86 and @xmath87 on substituting the relation for @xmath85 from equation ( [ hsquare ] ) , the above equations for a flat universe ( in which @xmath88 ) become @xmath89 }       \\right\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath84 is become , @xmath90 ( 1-\\beta )        e^{-3\\beta x }   } \\right \\ } = \\beta\\ ] ] from equations ( [ r ] ) and ( [ s ] ) , it is evident that @xmath91 if @xmath92 and no matter what value @xmath35 is , and this point in the @xmath0 plane is corresponds to the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "this point is a very fixed point , thus statefinder diagnostic fails to discriminate between @xmath2cdm model and mhrde model for the model parameter value @xmath93 since @xmath84 is a constant for flat universe in this model , the trajectory in the @xmath0 plane is a vertical segment , with constant @xmath84 during the evolution of the universe , while @xmath83 is monotonically decreasing form 1 , if @xmath36 is positive and monotonically increasing if @xmath36 is assuming negative values . for a simple understanding , let us assume that @xmath94 contribution is negligible small , when dark energy is dominating , then the equation ( [ r ] ) reduces to @xmath95 in this case for @xmath36=0.05 , 0.1 and 0.15 the corresponding values of @xmath83 are 0.79 , 0.60 , 0.43 respectively .",
