    "since the fundamental discovery by v.jones in 1984 of a new link invariant , there has been a tremendous interest and activity in low dimension topology using field theory techniques .",
    "the original definition of the jones polynomial was purely combinatorial and a geometrical understanding of it was finally given by e.witten in 1989 @xcite .",
    "he showed that the jones polynomial could be interpreted as the correlation function of wilson loops ( i.e traces of holonomies ) in chern - simons theory .",
    "his work opened a new area of research in what is now called three dimensional topological field theory .",
    "although this theory is purely topological ( i.e in a hamiltonian picture the hamiltonian is zero ) and therefore contains no dynamics , the quantization of this theory is not at all a trivial task , mainly because there is no direct procedure to quantify this theory .",
    "the original method of e.witten is a brilliant use of path integrals , heuristic regularization ( by a framing ) of wilson loops and relations with conformal field theory .",
    "although very appealing and having far reaching consequences , his formalism is not at all mathematically well defined and this is one of the reasons why many researchers in this field have used other approaches .",
    "these methods can be roughly divided in two classes : perturbative and non - perturbative methods . on the one hand perturbative methods",
    "have continuously attracted interest @xcite and have provided many interesting recent results : generalization of gauss invariants , connections with vassiliev invariants @xcite etc ... on the other hand , the geometrical quantization program and combinatorial methods are the main approaches to quantize nonperturbatively chern - simons theory .",
    "combinatorial methods , introduced by reshetikhin - turaev @xcite and turaev - viro @xcite give explicit representations of abstract amplitudes satisfying algebraic relations of a topological field theory . the essential ingredient in their approach",
    "is the representation theory of modular hopf algebras which provides family of numbers satisfying yang baxter equation , 6-j identities etc ... these combinatorial methods , although completely well defined , are losing completely the relationship with chern - simons theory .    in our work",
    "we will continue the study of a different type of quantization , named combinatorial quantization of hamiltonian chern simons theory , which has been introduced by v.v.fock and a.a.rosly @xcite and further developped by a.y.alekseev and al in @xcite and ourself @xcite .",
    "this quantization can be thought of as being a lattice regularization of chern simons theory in the spirit of wilson .",
    "after quantization , gauge invariance is replaced by gauge invariance under a quantum group , and the lattice variables , group elements before quantization , are replaced by elements of a non commutative algebra .",
    "the final and central object of our study is a two dimensional non commutative yang mills theory .",
    "elements of this program was already described in the abelian case in @xcite .    in section 2 of this work",
    "we give a summary of works on non commutative two dimensional yang mills theory .",
    "we associate to each compact triangulated surface @xmath1 a lattice gauge theory which is covariant under a quantum gauge group .",
    "the algebra @xmath3 of gauge fields is non commutative because matrix elements of gauge fields associated to arbitrary edges are non commuting .",
    "locality is however preserved in the sense that matrix elements of gauge fields associated to edges having no boundary points are commuting elements .",
    "wilson loops associated to non self - intersecting loops on the surface are defined and it is shown that these wilson loops are gauge invariant elements . a non commutative analogue of the yang mills action is built following the lines of a.a.migdal . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "exponential of this action is an analogue of the dirac delta function which selects gauge fields with zero curvature .",
    "this theory is therefore a topological field theory and the algebra of observables ( the moduli algebra ) @xmath4 of this theory is expected to be a new description of the algebra of observables of hamiltonian chern simons theory , i.e when the three manifold is equal to @xmath5    in section 3 we generalize this construction to the case where the loop is an arbitrary framed link @xmath6 in @xmath7.$ ] we obtain observables associated to these framed links which behave as desired : they are gauge invariant and are invariant under ambiant isotopy . as a result",
    "we obtain a new type of ribbon invariants which are not pure numbers but take their values in the algebra @xmath8 this algebra is non commutative except in the case @xmath2 where it is one dimensional . in that case",
    "the ribbon invariants take their value in the field @xmath9    the last part of our work gives the proof that these invariants in the case where @xmath2 are the reshetikhin - turaev invariants .",
