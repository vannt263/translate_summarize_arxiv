    "the quasi - steady state cosmology ( qssc ) has been proposed by hoyle , burbidge and narlikar ( 1993 , 1994@xmath3 , @xmath4 , 1995 ) as an alternative to the standard hot big bang model .",
    "this cosmology does away with the initial singularity , and does not have any cosmic epochs when the universe was very hot .",
    "the synthesis of light nuclei and the origin of the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) have therefore been explained by different physical processes than those invoked in the hot big bang .",
    "hoyle , burbidge and narlikar , 2000 ; burbidge and hoyle , 1998 ) .",
    "we concentrate here on the mbr and our purpose is to explain its observed fluctuations in terms of the large scale features of the qssc .",
    "first we begin with a brief description of how it is generated in this cosmology . a typical qssc scale factor for a flat robertson - walker universe",
    "is given by    @xmath5,\\ ] ]    where the time scales @xmath6 gyr @xmath7 gyr are considerably greater than the hubble time scale of 10 - 15 gyr of standard cosmology .",
    "the function @xmath8 is very nearly like @xmath9 , with significantly different behaviour for short duration near the minima of the function @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 has modulus less than unity thus preventing the scale factor from reaching zero .",
    "typically , @xmath12 . hence there is no spacetime singularity , nor a violation of the law of conservation of matter and energy , as happens at the big bang epoch in the standard model .",
    "this is because , matter in the universe is created through minibangs , through explosive processes in the nuclei of existing galaxies that produce matter and an equal quantity of a negative energy scalar field @xmath13 .",
    "such processes take place whenever the energy of the @xmath13-field quantum rises above the threshold energy @xmath14 , the restmass energy of the planck particle which is typically created . for details of the basic physics",
    "see hoyle et al ( 1995 ) and for models of the kind ( 1 ) see sachs et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "while the overall energy level of the @xmath13-field is below this threshold , it can rise in the neighbourhood of highly collapsed massive objects ( objects close to becoming black holes ) , and these then become the sites of creation .",
    "also since the overall energy density of the @xmath15field goes as @xmath16 , the creation is facilitated near the epochs of smallest @xmath17 .",
    "it is close to these relatively denser epochs that the creation activity is at its peak , switching itself off as the universe continues to expand in the cycle .",
    "hence from one cycle to another the density of matter would have fallen by the factor exp@xmath18 , but for the compensating creation of matter at the beginning of a new cycle at the minimum of @xmath17 .",
    "thus in the simplest model , although the universe is in a long term steady state , it oscillates over shorter time scales , with _",
    "each cycle physically the same as the preceding one_. each cycle has the new matter taking part in the process of formation of stars and galaxies which evolve exactly as in the previous cycle .",
    "what happens to the radiation of stars in this process ?",
    "assuming that the radiation density falls like @xmath16 in each cycle , it would be depleted by the factor exp@xmath19 from one oscillatory minimum to the next .",
    "it is this gap that is made up by the starlight generated during the cycle , since the universe is in a steady state from one cycle to the next .",
    "given @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the starlight energy generated per cycle , we can estimate the radiation background at any stage of a cycle .",
    "we have shown elsewhere ( hoyle , burbidge and narlikar 1994a , 2000 ) that it is this starlight thermalized by dust grains which is responsible for the microwave background ( mbr ) in the qssc .",
    "further , the estimate of starlight generated during the typical cycle allows one to show that after thermalization the temperature at the present epoch should be very close to @xmath22 k ( burbidge and hoyle 1998 ; hoyle et al 2000 ) .    in the following sections we first review the spectrum and homogeneity of the mbr in the qssc , and",
    "then describe the likely causes of inhomogeneity of the mbr .",
    "we finally compare the results with recent observations in which the fluctuations of the mbr at different angular scales have been measured .",
    "in this model it is hydrogen burning in stars in galaxies that generates the energy of the mbr , and the energy distribution of stellar radiation over different wavelengths from a typical galaxy varies through the cycle in the following way . at the minimum @xmath17 epoch , new gaseous material is acquired , and new stars are formed , with the energy coming out mostly in the blue to ultraviolet , from stars of masses greater than @xmath23 . however , as the cycle proceeds towards the maximum @xmath17 phase after the elapse of times of the order @xmath24 gyr , the massive stars burn out , leaving only the low mass stars still shining .",
    "the typical stars thus left are the dwarfs of types @xmath25 to @xmath26 , with the consequence that the radiation is then mainly in the red and the infrared . however , as the cycle proceeds towards the next minimum , these wavelengths are shortened since the universe contracts by a considerable factor .",
    "the total energy density of starlight generated in a given cycle can be estimated from the present observations of the starlight background and by extrapolating the star burning activity over the full cycle .",
    "suppose that this energy density is @xmath27 .",
    "if the background radiation energy density @xmath28 at the start of a cycle ( when the scale factor was at its minimum value @xmath29 ) were @xmath30 , then in the absence of any new addition to it , following the @xmath31 law , this would drop to @xmath32 at the end of the cycle . to maintain a steady state from one cycle to next therefore the shortfall in @xmath30",
    "is made up by @xmath27 .",
    "hence    @xmath33    this fixes the value of @xmath30 in terms of starlight energy input . if we know the maximum redshift @xmath34 in the present cycle , we find that the present energy density of the mbr is    @xmath35    the details of @xmath27 , @xmath34 , p and q were discussed in the papers cited above ( see , for example , hoyle et al 2000 ) .",
    "a present day mbr temperature of @xmath36 arises from such considerations .",
    "however , to talk of a ` temperature ' one must first show that the mbr has reached thermal equilibrium .",
    "we next describe briefly what must occur if this result is to be achieved .    to fix ideas",
    ", we will consider the typical oscillatory cycle from one minimum of scale factor to next .",
    "let    @xmath37    where , in going from one minimum to the next we have ignored the exponential term .",
    "it is clear from this time dependence , that in going from the maximum to the minimum , the scale factor drops by a factor @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "we shall assume as an additional parameter that the present epoch is characterized by @xmath40 .",
    "thus , infrared wavelengths of 1000 nm at @xmath41 are shortened to ultraviolet wavelengths of only @xmath42 nm at the @xmath43 ( minimum @xmath17 ) epoch .",
    "however , by this stage , the intergalactic density is increased by a factor @xmath44 as the minimum is approached and the issue of absorption becomes important . for it is through frequent absorptions and re - emissions that the radiation background gets thermalized .",
    "we have shown that metallic particles in the form of graphite whiskers as well as iron whiskers play a crucial role in the absorption process .",
    "as narlikar et al ( 1997 ) have discussed , a plausible case based on laboratory experiments and astrophysical evidence , can be made for the condensation of metallic whiskers from the hot ejecta of supernovae , which are blown out into intergalactic space by the shock waves generated at the time of explosion .",
    "the extinction properties of such whiskers , typically of length @xmath45 mm and diameter @xmath46 m differ considerably from those of normal spherical dust .",
    "in particular the iron whiskers at cryogenic temperatures are a dominant source of opacity in the microwave region , while carbon whiskers are more effective at the shorter uv wavelengths .",
    "typically a galaxy belongs to a cluster and we expect these whisker grains to fill up the intergalactic space within the cluster .",
    "the starlight from a galaxy in the cluster will therefore pass through such a dust as it emerges out of the cluster .",
    "we expect therefore absorption and re - radiation of starlight outside galaxies and also , in a larger angular scale , outside clusters .",
    "as we shall see later , the production of microwaves in this fashion will go on in each cycle , and the process of frequent absorption and re - radiation by whiskers will eventually generate a uniform background , _ except for the contribution from the latest generation of clusters_. these will stand out as inhomogeneities on the overall uniform background .",
    "the value of absorption coefficient @xmath47 for graphite whiskers is essentially constant for all wavelengths longer than @xmath48 m , extending even to the long radio wavelengths , being equivalent to an absorption coefficient of @xmath49@xmath50g@xmath51 .",
    "however , it is three times this value for the uv radiation .",
    "now an intergalactic density of @xmath52 g @xmath53 at @xmath41 would rise to @xmath54 g @xmath53 , at the minimum ( @xmath43 ) epoch . over a cosmological distance of @xmath55 cm at this stage ,",
    "the optical depth would be @xmath56 for uv , and @xmath45 for wavelengths longer than 1 @xmath57 m .",
    "it is significant that this type of dust plays a role in the observed redshift apparent magnitude relation of type ia supernovae . as shown by banerjee",
    "et al ( 2000 ) , an intergalactic dust density of the above order gives a very good fit to the observations ( perlmutter et al 1999 , riess et al 1998 ) .",
    "since the results are very sensitively dependent on dust density , it can not be fortuitous that the density for ` best fit ' in the supernova case is of the right order to explain thermalization of the mbr .",
    "further , recent studies of the high redshift supernova sn 1997@xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) show the model to be consistent with observations within the error - budget currently applicable ( vishwakarma 2002 , narlikar et al 2002 ) .",
    "the great bulk of the optical radiation that becomes subject to thermalization in the contracting phase of the oscillation will have traveled a distance of the order of 10 gpc , or even more in the case of microwaves .",
    "the radiation incident on a carbon whisker will have been in transit since the maximum @xmath17 epoch of the previous cycle , and it includes all the microwave radiation existing _ before _ the present cycle , as well as the starlight generated by the galaxies in the current cycle .",
    "the result is that all this radiation is well thermalized and uniform in energy density .",
    "however , the carbon whiskers themselves will be lumpily distributed , on the scale of clusters of galaxies .",
    "so , as the minimum of @xmath17 is approached at the end of the last cycle , the conversion of starlight to microwaves will have been lumpy . as the starlight",
    "is progressively absorbed , the typical grain temperature @xmath60 first rises above the mbr temperature @xmath61 before dropping back to it as the grain radiates .",
    "the effect of grains being lumpily distributed on the mbr is to cause the slight rise followed by the fall back to the mbr temperature to be lumpy too .",
    "the radiation background itself , however , does not have this lumpiness : because the total assembly of grains has a negligible heat content and in thermal equilibrium , each grain emits as much heat as it receives .",
    "since the emissivity of the particles does not depend on wavelength , each emits a planckian spectrum corresponding to its temperature @xmath60 .",
    "eventually when all particles come down to the temperature @xmath62 , however , further absorption and reemission bring about a strict planckian distribution at this temperature .",
    "although as was suggested by narlikar , wickramasinghe and edmunds ( 1975 ) , the thermalization can be achieved by the carbon whiskers , the presence of a small quantity of iron whiskers helps the process further .",
    "the absorption and re - radiation by the whiskers at the oscillatory minimum , thus generate a mixing of radiation from distances as far as @xmath63 cm , at the relatively low intergalactic particle densities prevalent there , so in effect permitting radiation to travel freely .",
    "this picture suggests that the overall background will be very smooth",
    ". however , there will be some tiny fluctuations of intensity stamped on it arising from certain intrinsic inhomogeneities of the process as well as the cosmological model .",
    "we consider them in decreasing order of angular scale .    for this purpose",
    "we propose a simple model in which the sources of inhomogeneities can be traced to the epoch of last minimum of oscillation ( @xmath64 in our present case ) .",
    "this is the maximum density epoch when the extinction by dust will be most effective .",
    "the characteristic geometrical size of the model is determined by the spacetime curvature @xmath65 and will be of the order @xmath66 .",
    "any large scale inhomogeneity of the mbr would arise over this characteristic cosmological size .",
    "this size features in standard cosmology also and is referred to as the ` horizon size ' or the ` hubble radius ' ( _ see _ weinberg 1972 ) . for smaller sizes we need to take note of inhomogeneity on the scale of rich clusters of galaxies , since they represent local concentrations of starlight not yet fully thermalized and redistributed . on still smaller scales we expect to see inhomogeneities on the scale of groups of galaxies or even individual galaxies .",
    "( there should likewise be some inhomogeneity on the scale of superclusters , but it is expected to produce a weaker effect and we will ignore it in the present model . )",
    "it is clear from the above that the issue of inhomogeneities of the mbr in the qssc is linked with the way large scale structures are formed in this cosmology .",
    "a structure formation scenario in the qssc has not been developed to the level of sophistication that it has acquired in standard cosmology .",
    "a toy model by nayeri et al ( 1999 ) has shown , however , that the structure formation process as in the qssc is very different from that in the standard cosmology , being essentially driven by the minicreation events with gravitation playing a secondary role .",
    "thus existence of galaxies and clusters at high redshifts ( @xmath67 ) is taken for granted in the qssc picture of structure formation .",
    "the toy model of nayeri et al shows how clustering at various scales develops from an initial random distribution , through creation events and expansion . in a ` steady state ' situation the model has to demonstrate how the physical conditions in one qssc cycle are repeated in the next",
    ". we will elaborate on this idea in the following section .    to give quantitative estimates of the above effects",
    ", we will choose the same cosmological parameters that we have used to explain the redshift magnitude relation based on type ia supernovae ( _ see _ banerjee , et al , 2000 ) .",
    "they are :    @xmath68    the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 do not enter explicitly in the calculation but we may typically take them to be 1000 gyr and 50 gyr , respectively .    the largest angular scale will arise from the size of spacetime curvature . at the present epoch",
    "this will be of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "this curvature corresponds to a linear size @xmath70 .",
    "as we go towards the minimum scale factor epoch , this scale decreases .",
    "the angle subtended by the scale at us from the minimum scale epoch can be worked out . for the parameters @xmath71 gyr , @xmath72 gyr , @xmath73 , we get an angular size of @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore expect this scale to show up in the regime of relatively large angular scale fluctuations of the intensity of mbr . the first discovery of inhomogeneity of mbr by cobe ( smoot et al 1992 ) was of this order .    to assess the magnitude of fluctuations",
    ", we reproduce the arguments of hoyle , at al ( 1994a ) . consider the whisker grain distribution at the epoch of last minimum of @xmath10 .",
    "the whiskers may be distributed non - uniformly to begin with , with some regions having larger whisker densities than others . until the deviations from uniformity of radiation background become too small , they are able to push the grains down the temperature gradients to restore uniformity .",
    "consider a fluctuation by a small factor @xmath75 in the average energy density @xmath76 erg @xmath53 of the microwaves at this stage .",
    "a fluctuation of this order is able to _ move _ grains of density @xmath77 and velocity @xmath78 provided @xmath79 . with @xmath80 g @xmath53 and @xmath81 ( an adequate speed to fill a region of size @xmath82 cm in the available cosmological times of the order @xmath83 ) , we get @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath85 .",
    "this is of right order as found by cobe .",
    "thus any temperature fluctuations above this value would create temperature gradients of such magnitude as to move the grains around from high to low density regions and to thereby create a uniformity . only small enough fluctuations would therefore remain intact over regions of size @xmath86 cm .",
    "regions of this order are characteristic of the curvature size referred to above .",
    "the strongest fluctuations will , however , come from rich clusters of galaxies lying in the present cycle .",
    "these denote the late additions to the background already in existence from starlight of previous cycles .",
    "note that the light from stars belonging to galaxies in clusters of earlier generations will already have been fully thermalized and such clusters will not stand up as fluctuations .",
    "it is only the newer clusters at the last oscillatory minimum with inadequate time to have been merged in the rest of the thermal background , that would produce fluctuations .",
    "a typical cluster produces the extra starlight , which on subsequent thermalization produces additional temperature @xmath87 over the average background temperature @xmath88 .",
    "such a fluctuation will be confined to the neighbourhood of the cluster .",
    "we show next how to estimate it .",
    "imagine a 10 mpc size region , typically containing @xmath89 galaxies , each emitting starlight at the rate @xmath90 erg s@xmath51 ( corresponding to an average galaxy with absolute magnitude @xmath9121.4 ) .",
    "the flux of radiation in the form of degraded starlight across the surface of this region ( assumed to be a sphere of radius 5 mpc ) , will be @xmath92 erg s@xmath51 @xmath93 .",
    "now , the present energy density of mbr @xmath94 erg @xmath53 , implies that by the @xmath95 rule , it was @xmath96 times this value at the epoch of the last minimum of @xmath17 . using stefan s law the flux across a sphere of radius 5 mpc for this radiation will be @xmath97 times the energy density , i.e. , about 4.08 erg s@xmath51 @xmath93 . comparing the excess flux due to the galaxies in this region computed above with this value we find that there is an excess flux equal to @xmath98 of the average background .",
    "equating this to @xmath99 , we find that the temperature fluctuation @xmath100 .    because of the inhomogeneity of the universe on the scale of clusters ,",
    "the calculation can not be made more precise , and at this stage one should only look at its order of magnitude . the fact that this calculation yields a temperature fluctuation of the order reported by the various observations is , from the point of view of the qssc , very encouraging .",
    "clusters of galaxies are normally associated with a temperature decrement because of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "indeed observations show such effects for clusters of redshifts @xmath101 .",
    "by contrast , the effect described above is predominant for clusters of large redshifts @xmath102 , corresponding to the epoch of the last minimum of the scale factor .",
    "thus we expect the thermalization effect to dominate over the s - z effect for such clusters , whereas for later epochs the former effect gets reduced since dust extinction is much less . a more detailed study of cluster formation and evolution in the qssc is required to decide at what stage clusters begin to acquire hot gas and when the gas temperature rises to levels when the s - z effect becomes important .",
    "after such a study is carried out it will be possible to estimate the average s - z decrement of temperature in any given direction by integrating over redshifts going up to the above stage .    over and above the clusters we expect smaller scale fluctuations on the scales of individual galaxies .",
    "the metallic whiskers are generated and ejected from inside a typical galaxy .",
    "they have escape - velocities that take them well beyond the galaxy into its immediate external environment .",
    "thus we expect that the extra starlight generated by the galaxy will provide a slight excess of @xmath87 in this region after thermalization .",
    "the typical length scale of a small group of galaxies would be @xmath103 mpc .",
    "from the above discussion it is clear that according to the qssc the fluctuations of the mbr arose at the relatively recent epochs ( associated with the last minimum of expansion of the scale factor ) and they would be related to the large scale structure in the universe .",
    "we will therefore outline briefly the current ideas on this topic in the framework of the qssc .",
    "we will consider in particular the formation and distribution of clusters of galaxies , since they will turn out to have the most significant effect on the smoothness of mbr .",
    "for details we refer the reader to banerjee and narlikar ( 1997 ) and nayeri , et al ( 1999 ) .      to begin with",
    ", it is necessary to contrast the structure formation process in the qssc with that in the standard cosmology . in standard cosmology",
    ", structure formation begins in the form of small scale fluctuations in the spacetime metric as well as matter contents , fluctuations which are believed to be of quantum origin .",
    "these fluctuations then evolve as they grow under the effect of gravitation , with the inflationary phase playing an essential role by modifying the spectrum of inhomogeneities to the scale - invariant form .",
    "the inhomogeneities continue to grow with gravitational clustering playing a major role .",
    "since radiation and matter ( at least the baryonic part ) were strongly coupled in the early epochs , the growth of fluctuations in matter affects radiation also .",
    "this interaction continues till the surface of last scattering and the inhomogeneities imprinted on the radiation background at that stage get imprinted on the mbr and can be observed today .",
    "it is essential to appreciate that the above scenario _ does not occur _ in the qssc whose past history is quite different from that of the standard cosmology . in the qssc the quantum gravity dominated epoch as well as inflation did not occur ; nor was there a surface of last scattering . thus to understand the presence of fluctuations in the mbr one needs to look at an entirely different scenario in which creation of matter at periodic intervals of a finitely oscillating universe having a long - term de sitter type expansion , plays a key role .    that the gravitational force does not play the primary role in structure formation in this scenario",
    "is seen from the work of banerjee and narlikar ( 1997 ) , wherein these authors looked at the evolution of small departures from the spacetime metric of the qssc as well as its matter density and flow vector .",
    "specifying the unperturbed metric by the flat robertson - walker line element ,    @xmath104\\ ] ]    with @xmath10 given by ( 1 ) , the perturbed metric is written as    @xmath105    here @xmath106 is the minkowski metric @xmath107 ; @xmath108 spacelike coordinates and @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 .",
    "likewise the density is perturbed from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , @xmath113 and the flow vector from @xmath114 to @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "the perturbed set of field equations therefore describe the full gravitational effect on the perturbations . banerjee and narlikar ( op.cit . )",
    "found that in a typical oscillation , these perturbations grow to a limited extent before subsiding .",
    "these authors therefore concluded that gravitational effects can not play a major role in forming large scale structure in the qssc .",
    "in fact the dynamics of the qssc requires the existence of an additional force ( besides gravitation ) which is derived from a scalar field @xmath13 ( hoyle et al , 1995 , sachs et al , 1996 ) . this scalar field in turn is related to the creation of matter .",
    "a look at the field equations of the qssc will help understand why this field acts in such a way that gravitation does not play a key role in structure formation .",
    "these equations are :    @xmath117,\\ ] ]    where @xmath118 is the usual matter tensor while @xmath119 is given by    @xmath120.\\ ] ]    both @xmath121 and @xmath122 are positive .",
    "thus the energy tensor of the @xmath13-field has a negative coefficient ( @xmath123 ) which makes its effect on spacetime structure repulsive , i.e. , acting in direction opposite to gravity . _",
    "note that this tensor acts even when no creation is going on_. this is why , during a typical oscillation the normal gravitational processes of clustering are impeded .",
    "a parallel may be cited from standard cosmology with a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath124 ) . in those models which have",
    "the @xmath125-term sufficiently strong even in the early stages , gravitational clustering and formation of structures can not take place .",
    "for example , with the presently favoured value of @xmath125 , clustering ceased at @xmath126 .",
    "however , the @xmath13-field intervenes in a different way through its property that it induces creation of matter . as discussed next ,",
    "matter is created near collapsed massive objects ( i.e. , objects close to becoming black holes ) and the created matter is ejected outwards because of the negative stresses generated by the @xmath13-field .",
    "it is this creation phenomenon that holds the key to structure formation in the qssc .",
    "the field equations of the @xmath15field show that at the point of creation of a particle of momentum @xmath127 , the gradient of the @xmath15field satisfies the condition @xmath128 , ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus , if the rest mass of the particle created is @xmath130 , then ( with the speed of light @xmath131 ) we have at creation @xmath132 .",
    "the use of this relation in the schwarzschild solution near a massive object of mass @xmath26 shows that at a coordinate distance @xmath133 the magnitude of the @xmath13-field energy is raised to    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the magnitude of the energy at large distances from the massive object .",
    "now it may happen in general that @xmath136 , so that no creation takes place in general .",
    "however , near a highly collapsed massive object for @xmath133 close enough to the schwarzschild radius of the object , the creation condition is satisfied and creation can take place ( hoyle and narlikar 1966 ) .",
    "the process normally begins by the creation of the @xmath13-field along with matter in the neighbourhood of a compact massive object .",
    "the former , being propagated by the wave equation , tends to travel outwards with the speed of light , leaving the created mass behind .",
    "however , as the created mass grows , its gravitational redshift begins to assert itself , and it traps the @xmath13-field in the vicinity of the object . as the strength of the @xmath13-field grows , its repulsive effect begins to manifest itself , thus making the object less and less bound and unstable .",
    "finally , a stage may come when a part of the object is ejected from it with tremendous energy .",
    "it is thus possible for a parent compact mass to eject a bound unit outwards .",
    "this unit may act as a centre of creation in its own right .",
    "we shall refer to such pockets of creation as _",
    "minibangs _ or _ mini - creation events _ ( mces ) . a spherical ( schwarzschild type )",
    "compact matter distribution will lead to a spherically symmetric explosion whereas an axi - symmetric ( kerr type ) distribution would lead to jet - like ejection along the symmetric axis .",
    "because of the conservation of angular momentum of a collapsing object , it is expected that the latter situation will in general be more likely . using this picture nayeri et al ( 1999 )",
    "proposed a toy model for structure formation and evolution , which is summarized next .    a large number of points ( @xmath137 ) , each one representing a mini - creation event , is distributed randomly over a unit cubical area .",
    "the average nearest - neighbour distance for such a distribution will then be @xmath138 .",
    "now suppose that in a typical mini - creation event , each point generates another neighbour point at random within a distance , @xmath139 in 3@xmath140 . here , the number @xmath141 is a fraction between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "we shall call @xmath141 the separation parameter .",
    "it denotes an ejected piece lying at a distance @xmath144 from the parent compact object .",
    "the sample cube is then homologously stretched by a linear factor @xmath145 to represent expansion of space .",
    "we now have the same density of points as before , i.e. , @xmath146 points over a volume of 2 units . from this enlarged cube",
    "remove the periphery so as to retain only the inner unit cube.this process thus brings us back to the original state but with a different distribution of an average @xmath147 points over a unit cube . this process is repeated @xmath148 times . here",
    "the number of iterations , @xmath148 , plays the role of `` time '' as in the standard models of structure formation .",
    "the number distribution of points evolves as the ` creation + expansion process ' generates new points near the existing ones .    not surprisingly , soon after ,",
    "i.e. , after @xmath149 iterations of the above procedure , clusters and voids begin to emerge in the sample volume and create a _",
    "persian carpet _ type of patterns .",
    "as the experiment is repeated , voids grow in size while clusters become denser . fig .",
    "1 illustrates the point distribution within a typical thin slice of thickness 0.001 of the cube and shows that expansion coupled with creation of matter is a natural means of generating voids and clusters .    to bring the toy model closer to the reality of the qssc , nayeri , et al proceeded as follows .",
    "since the creation activity is expected to be confined largely to a narrow era around a typical oscillatory minimum , when the @xmath13-field is at its strongest , by considering the number density of collapsed massive objects at one oscillatory minimum of qssc to be @xmath122 , the number density at the next oscillatory minimum would fall to @xmath150 , that is , _ if no new massive objects were added_. thus to restore a steady state from one cycle to the next , within each unit volume    @xmath151 f \\sim ( 3q / p ) f,\\ ] ]    masses must be created anew . in other words ,",
    "a fraction @xmath152 of the total number of massive objects must replicate themselves in the above fashion .",
    "notice that , unlike the old steady state theory which had new matter appearing continuously , we have here discrete creation , confined to epochs of minimum of scale factor .",
    "the ` steady - state ' is maintained from one cycle to next . which is why the above fractional addition @xmath152 is required at the beginning of each cycle .",
    "therefore , instead of creating a new neighbour point around each and every one of the original set of @xmath147 points , one does so only around @xmath153 of these points chosen randomly , where the fraction @xmath152 is as defined in equation ( 11 ) .",
    "likewise , the sample volume is homologously expanded by the factor @xmath154 only instead of by factor 2 .",
    "although visual inspection of figures like 1 suggests that the toy model is proceeding along the right lines , a _ quantitative _ measure of the cluster - void distribution helps in comparing simulations with reality .",
    "the dimensionless autocorrelation function    @xmath155[\\rho ( { \\bf r}_1 + { \\bf r})-<\\rho>]>/<\\rho>^2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath156 is the average density in the volume , is one convenient measure of such irregularities in the space distribution .",
    "typically , different classes of objects cluster at different characteristic lengths . to fix ideas nayeri",
    "et al ( 1999 ) looked at distribution of clusters of galaxies .",
    "observationally , it is believed that the two point correlation function for cluster distribution obeys the following scaling law :    @xmath157    with @xmath158 and @xmath159 mpc , where the hubble constant at the present epoch is taken to be @xmath160 kms@xmath51mpc@xmath51 . in order to quantify the issues of formation of structures in this scenario nayeri ,",
    "et al ( op.cit ) took the following measures .",
    "it is known that instead of having a uniform distribution of matter on large scales , the observed universe has structures of typical sizes of a few tens of megaparsecs .",
    "these `` structures '' are regions of density considerably higher than the background density , with the maximum density contrast @xmath161 going from order unity ( in the case of clusters ) to a few thousand ( in the case of the galaxies ) .    any process which generates structures must be able to produce to the zeroth order , entities whose density contrast is of such magnitude and with the property that on larger and larger distance scales , the density contrast became less significant .",
    "this ensures that on a large enough scale the universe is homogeneous .",
    "given this prescription for generating structures without gravitational dynamics , nayeri , et al first ensured that the visual impression created by the cluster simulations did imply that as the number of iterations were increased the number of high density regions also increased . in the initial ( totally random ) configuration one expects to find regions of high density arising only because of the poisson noise . in the later `` epochs '' after a few iterations , however , one would expect to find , as in a clustering scenario , that the variation of the one point distribution function for density @xmath162 with @xmath156 the average density in the volume , showed a steady and significant increase in the the number of high and intermediate density regions .",
    "this expectation was borne out and it was also observed that the value of maximum density also increased as a function of the number of iterations , which in this experiment corresponds to `` time '' .",
    "the density field was generated on a grid placed into the simulation volume using the algorithm of cloud in cell .",
    "the simulations showed the growth of structures through rise in the density maximum as a function of number of iterations .",
    "a quantitative measure that was computed from these data sets was the two - point correlation function .",
    "2 shows the two point correlation function for the case of the qssc based model . as `` time '' goes on , the slope of the correlation function gets closer and closer to @xmath163 . from the value of the x - axis intercept of the two point correlation function nayeri ,",
    "et al could get a rough estimate of the size of the structures in units of the size of our simulation box . from their results they estimated that the size of the structures formed is approximately @xmath164 times the boxsize .",
    "if one sets these values equal to the observationally accepted value of @xmath165 , one can get a better physical sense of the results .",
    "if we set , @xmath166 , say , and @xmath167 mpc , then the linear size of the simulation box would be @xmath168 mpc .",
    "typical cluster masses and sizes resulted from such a numerical exercise .",
    "this may be seen as an attempt to relate the toy model to a realistic cosmological scenario .",
    "of course , as the above exercise shows , the results can be scaled up / down by rescaling the simulation parameters and thus are independent of the ` absolute ' size of the box .",
    "a more detailed dynamical theory of the creation process will help relate the absolute size of clustering to the theoretical parameters .",
    "we now examine the typical angular scales of these three types of inhomogeneities and how they are reflected in the angular power spectrum of the mbr .",
    "so far as clusters are concerned , we will fold in the above evolving two - point correlation function into our calculation .",
    "typically we will look at the angle subtended by a linear scale @xmath3 of an object located at redshift @xmath169 in the quasi - steady state model whose scale factor is defined in equation ( 1 ) . to compute the above angle , we define the dimensionless parameters by the following formulae :    @xmath170    here @xmath125 is the cosmological constant , which is negative in the qssc . in the model considered by banerjee",
    "et al ( 2000 ) as well as here , @xmath171 the angle subtended at the observer by the above scale at redshift @xmath169 ( @xmath172 banerjee and narlikar , 1999 ) is then given by    @xmath173^{-1}.\\ ] ]    we will take @xmath174 .",
    "( the maximum redshift used here is indicative only .",
    "the results do not change much even if it were increased to 6 - 10 . )",
    "the calculation , using the parameters of ( 5 ) , then gives    @xmath175    where @xmath3 is measured in units of megaparsecs .",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , angles will be referred to in radians .",
    "this then is the characteristic angle subtended by an object of linear size @xmath3 mpc , viewed when close to the last minimum . assuming that this is the size of a rich cluster of galaxies",
    ", we expect that the characteristic angular size of the mbr inhomogeneity it generates will be of this order .",
    "as we will shortly show , this does translate to a peak in the angular power spectrum at a harmonic of order @xmath176 .",
    "so we arrive at the following approximate relationship between cluster size and the harmonic it generates :    @xmath177    if we set @xmath178 radius of curvature at the last minimum , we expect a large angle peak at @xmath179",
    ". the smaller angle peaks will occur at much larger values of @xmath180 .",
    "thus a peak in the power spectrum of mbr anisotropy at harmonic @xmath181 as observed by the boomerang and the maxima groups ( de bernardis et al 2000 , hanany et al , 2000 ) is generated in this theory by rich clusters of diameter @xmath182 mpc , located at cosmological distances .",
    "smaller peaks are expected on the scale of groups of galaxies , at the higher values of @xmath183 , and on the scale of superclusters at the lower values @xmath184 .",
    "these latter peaks will be smaller than the cluster peak at @xmath185 and thus they will be much harder to detect .",
    "we next show that these expectations are borne out by detailed calculations of this effect on the angular power spectrum of mbr .",
    "we model the above effect along the lines of hajian and souradeep ( 2002 ) as follows .",
    "imagine a typical type of inhomogeneity as a set of small disc - shaped spots , randomly distributed on a unit sphere .",
    "the spots may be either ` top hat ' type or ` gaussian ' type .",
    "in the former case they have sharp boundaries whereas in the latter case they taper outwards",
    ". we will assume the former for clusters , and the latter for the curvature effect and also for galaxies or groups of galaxies .",
    "this is because the clusters will tend to have rather sharp boundaries whereas in the other two cases such sharp limits do not exist .",
    "let us begin with the simple case of a random distribution of infinitesimally small spots",
    ". with each direction @xmath186 for a typical spot centre on the sky chosen randomly , we have from @xmath147 such spots of roughly identical temperature fluctuation @xmath187    @xmath188    here",
    "@xmath189 is a general direction on the unit sphere .",
    "if the locations of the spots in the sky are uncorrelated , we have    @xmath190    writing @xmath87 as a function on the sphere , we expand it in a series of @xmath191 :    @xmath192    the expansion of @xmath193 in terms of the spherical harmonic functions allows us to obtain    @xmath194    the corresponding angular power spectrum is given by    @xmath195    in the last step we use eq .  ( 19 ) that encodes our simplistic assumption of uncorrelated spots .",
    "we get , for large @xmath180 , @xmath196 .",
    "this result is valid for angular scales much larger than the angular scale of the typical spot .",
    "the @xmath197 rise is a direct consequence of assuming that the location of the spots are uncorrelated .",
    "more detailed modeling where the correlation between the spots is included would serve to soften the @xmath197 rise",
    ". it may be an important issue when comparing our results with observations of mbr inhomogeneity on large angular scales .",
    "however , we need to model spots of finite sizes ranging from @xmath198 to a few arc minutes , corresponding to the three typical inhomogeneities discussed above . for spots of finite size , assumed to be circularly symmetric with a given profile centered on the typical spot centre , we have a modification of ( 18 ) in the form ( where the delta function is replaced by a function @xmath122 ) :    @xmath199    using the circular symmetry of the spots , we expand    @xmath200    in terms of its legendre transform , @xmath201 .",
    "it is then possible to express    @xmath202    assuming the location of the @xmath147 spots to be uncorrelated and randomly distributed ( see eq .",
    "( 19 ) ) this gives    @xmath203    for a normalized gaussian spot profile with typical ( 1-@xmath204 width ) angular size @xmath205 , the function @xmath201 is given by    @xmath206    the angular power spectrum @xmath207 has a single peak at @xmath208 .    for a top hat profile , wherein the spot has uniform temperature fluctuation across a finite disc of angular size @xmath205 , with a sharp drop - off to the background temperature outside",
    ", the function @xmath201 is given by    @xmath209\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    the @xmath210 in this case has a series of peaks in the multipole space .",
    "the first peak in @xmath211 for top - hat spots occur at @xmath212 and has the largest amplitude .",
    "the successive peaks occur roughly at integer multiples with diminishing peak amplitude .",
    "we therefore consider a composite model in which the inhomogeneities of the mbr arise from a superposition of random spots of three characteristic sizes corresponding to the three effects discussed above . from the order of magnitude estimates made earlier ,",
    "we expect three peaks in the angular power spectrum at their respective @xmath180 - ranges . to check the accuracy of this expectation , we consider a @xmath213 - parameter modeling of the angular power spectrum    @xmath214 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ { } & & + a_3\\,\\ , l(l+1)e^{-l^{2}\\alpha^{2}_{3}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the parameters @xmath215 determined by obtaining the best fit with the present observations of the angular power spectrum of mbr inhomogeneities .",
    "the parameters @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 depend on the number density as well as the typical temperature fluctuation of each kind of spot . however , given @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , it is possible to compute the _",

    "the analysis till now has assumed that the distribution of hot spots is uncorrelated . as described in the previous section , toy model of structure formation within qssc",
    "does recover the observed power law spatial correlation in the distribution of clusters .",
    "we extend the computation of cmb anisotropy spectrum to the case when the hot spots are correlated .",
    "we do this only for the hot spots that are linked to the clusters .",

    "two peaks are easily visible at @xmath242 and 200 while a third peak at the much higher value of @xmath243 is probably present .",

    "this is useful for a comparison with any other model .",
    "it is encouraging to note that the parameters for the best fit model are broadly consistent with our expectations .",
    "the value of @xmath259 is somewhat below the expected range of @xmath260  @xmath261 .",

    "we also note the significance of the top - hat approximation to spot profile in clusters in our fit to the data .",
    "if we replace the top - hat profile of cluster anisotropy by a gaussian then we can find a best fit model with @xmath265 with parameters @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",

    "in the qssc the mbr arises from the matter in galaxies and this is quite different from its origin in the hot big bang cosmology . for example , the major peak ( at @xmath317 ) in the mbr in the framework of the qssc is explained in terms of rich clusters of galaxies , whereas in the hot big bang cosmology it is the ` doppler ' peak associated with acoustic oscillations of the photon -baryon fluid .",
    "the qssc interpretation links the inhomogeneities of the radiation field to those of the matter field , visible matter in the form of clusters of galaxies .",
    "indeed , one may argue that in the qssc interpretation , the observations of mbr - inhomogeneities provide us with a direct diagnostic of the structural hierarchy in the universe .",
