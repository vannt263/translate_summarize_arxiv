    "modifying a gravitational theory dates back to late 1800s , there were some attempts modeled on maxwell s electrodynamics to modify newtonian gravity .",
    "since einstein developed his general relativity ( gr ) in 1915 , various attempts with different motivations have been carried out to generalize it @xcite .",
    "some motivations have theoretical character and some observational .",
    "einstein himself modified the original field equations by adding a term including the cosmological constant .",
    "also he proposed the palatini formulation of gr @xcite .",
    "eddington proposed an interesting alternative to gr in 1924 @xcite .",
    "brans - dicke theory @xcite and the einstein - cartan theory @xcite are two other examples of a very broad variety of alternatives .",
    "currently , observations of the dark matter and the dark energy provide one of the main motivations for extending gr ( for a review on modified gravity theories see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main intriguing enigmas in gr is that it predicts the existence of space - time singularity at some finite time in the past .",
    "however it turns out that gr itself is no longer valid at the singularity because of the expected quantum effects . on the other hand a precise formulation for quantum gravity is still lacking",
    "nevertheless , there are some classical models in which this kind of singularity can be resolved . for example",
    "eddington - inspired born - infeld ( eibi ) theory , is a modified theory of gravity which is equivalent to gr only in vacuum and can resolve the singularity @xcite . for other examples and also for other motivations behind this kind of modifications , we refer the reader to the review article @xcite . here",
    "we propose a new model which , despite of its simple appearance , possesses interesting features .",
    "let us start with the following action @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath1 is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath7 is the ricci scalar , @xmath8 , @xmath4 is the cosmological constant and @xmath9 is the matter action .",
    "also @xmath10 is a coupling constant which its value can be constrained by observations . for a somehow similar approach",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite",
    ". in general @xmath10 can be negative or positive .",
    "however as we will show in this paper , a positive @xmath10 leads to a bounce at early universe and to a satisfactory cosmological behavior after the bounce .",
    "this bounce avoids the early time singularity . on the other hand , as we will see in section [ cosmology ]",
    ", a negative @xmath10 leads to unsatisfactory cosmological behavior .",
    "more specifically there is no stable late time accelerated phase in the case of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore our main purpose in this paper is to study the @xmath12 case .",
    "the situation here is somehow reminiscent of the appearance of the cosmological constant in the standard cosmological model , where @xmath4 is postulated to be positive .",
    "a negative cosmological constant leads to completely different consequences which are inconsistent with the cosmological observations .",
    "more specifically positive @xmath4 accelerates the universe while a negative @xmath4 decelerates it .",
    "the standard einstein - hilbert action can be recovered by setting @xmath13 .",
    "because of the correction term @xmath14 , we refer to this theory as energy - momentum squared gravity ( emsg ) . throughout the paper , we use units with @xmath15 and assume the metric signature @xmath16 for the metric .",
    "it is natural to expect that this correction term be important only in the high energy regimes such as the early universe or within the black holes .",
    "therefore there are no departures from gr in the low curvature regime .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ fe ]",
    "we derive the field equations of emsg by varying the action with respect to the metric . in section [ cosmology ]",
    "we derive the modified freidmann equations and show that there is a maximum energy density and a minimum length at early universe ( when @xmath12 ) . also using the dynamical system method we study the cosmological consequences of emsg .",
    "more specifically we show that this theory possesses a true sequence of cosmological epochs . in section [ cbh ] , we find an exact charged black hole solution in emsg .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ conc ] .",
    "before moving on to derive the field equations it is important to mention that the correction term @xmath17 can be defined only when the lagrangian density for the matter content is specified .",
    "therefore one may not immediately obtain the field equations from a first - order variation of the action .",
    "in other words , one must first vary the matter action with respect to the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "although this feature is not the case in gr , it appears in theories which introduce correction terms including the energy - momentum tensor in the generic action , for example see @xcite .    comparing the action with the einstein - hilbert action , it is obvious that we need only vary the @xmath14 term with respect to metric . in other words , the other terms",
    "lead to the standard terms in the einstein field equations .",
    "thus we have @xmath18 we know that @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the last term in the right hand side of can be simply written as @xmath20 now let us consider the first term in the right hand side of .",
    "we can write @xmath21 consequently we obtain @xmath22 where the new tensor @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 finally , bearing in mind that variation of the other terms lead to the convenient terms in the einstein field equations , the field equations of emsg can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the einstein tensor and the effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 from , it is clear that @xmath29 and consequently @xmath30 .",
    "we also recall that the matter action @xmath9 can be written as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor then is defined as @xmath33 assuming that @xmath32 depends only on the metric itself and not on its derivatives , we obtain @xmath34 see @xcite for more details .",
    "as it is clear from field equations , we need the variation of the energy - momentum tensor with respect to the metric . therefore using equation we can write @xmath35 where we have also used the following expression @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the generalized kronecker delta symbol .",
    "this relation can be simply obtained using the condition @xmath38 . finally multiplying equation through by @xmath39 , we find @xmath23 with respect to the matter lagrangian density @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "therefore for a given matter lagrangian density the field equations are completely known . in the case of a perfect fluid @xmath32",
    "can be simply defined as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the non - relativistic limit of this theory is the same as the newtonian limit of gr .",
    "therefore the poisson equation does not change .",
    "albeit , @xmath10 needs to be small enough to pass the the classical tests of gravity .",
    "however , in the presence of matter sources , the higher post - newtonian corrections will be different from that of gr .    before moving on to discuss the cosmology of emsg ,",
    "let us first discuss some points about the appearance of @xmath4 in the action of emsg . as we will see in the next section , when @xmath12 the correction terms in emsg are important only in the sufficiently early times , and do not disturb the late time cosmology .",
    "therefore it is evident that without any contribution from other extra fields , such as scalar fields which can enter the matter lagrangian , emsg can not be considered as a dark energy model .",
    "consequently one has to retain the cosmological constant in the theory in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "of course , as in gr , one may remove the cosmological constant and add new energy contributions to @xmath1 in order to construct a dynamical dark energy model .",
    "we mean that one can , for instance , add a quintessence scalar field to the theory instead of keeping the cosmological constant .",
    "however , comparing emsg with gr a question naturally raises .",
    "we know that in gr , @xmath4 can be a part of the geometric sector . in this case",
    "@xmath4 is written in the left hand side of the einstein equations . in this case , let us call it `` bare '' cosmological constant as it is called in @xcite . on the other hand it can be a part of the matter action . in this case one may assign an effective perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor to @xmath4 with energy density @xmath44 and pressure @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . in this case @xmath4 can be called as `` vacuum energy '' .",
    "albeit the field equations are the same in both pictures .",
    "then the questions is : does emsg lead to different field equations when we put @xmath4 in the geometric part or in the matter action ? here we show that emsg , unlike gr , discriminates between these approaches .",
    "this is also the case in other theories which include scalars constructed from the energy - momentum tensor , such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in their generic action , for example see @xcite .",
    "now let us put the cosmological constant in the matter action .",
    "therefore the total energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath49 and after some algebra , the field equations can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath27 is still given by and depends only on @xmath51 .",
    "all the contributions from @xmath52 have been collected in the new tensor @xmath53 as    @xmath54    in following we show that @xmath55 .",
    "this means that by putting the cosmological constant in the matter sector , we get different field equations than . thus the cosmological behavior , in principle , would be different . using @xmath46 and equations - , we find @xmath56 therefore @xmath53 takes the following form @xmath57 it is obvious that in this case field equations are more complicated than the case of a bare cosmological constant .",
    "more specifically , as expected , @xmath58 term appears in the field equations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in gr , an effective cosmological constant can be defined as the linear sum of a bare cosmological constant and the vacuum energy contribution @xcite . however , as we showed , it is not that simple in emsg and the gravitational effects of a bare cosmological constant and the vacuum energy can not be summed simply . on the other hand , in gr , interpreting @xmath4 as the vacuum energy raises the so - called cosmological constant problem .",
    "consequently , for the sake of simplicity , we adopt the geometric description , the bare cosmological constant , in this paper .",
    "a more general case including the vacuum energy can be considered as a matter of study for future works .",
    "therefore we work with the field equations in what follows .",
    "let us start with the consequences of this theory in the early universe where we expect significant deviations from the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "we assume a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "also we assume an ideal energy - momentum tensor @xmath61 for the cosmic fluid . using field equation , we find the modified version of the friedmann equations @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 and the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "equations and together with an equation of state form a complete set to study the dynamics of the cosmic fluid and the scale factor .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the correction terms in the equations and are somewhat reminiscent of those from quantum geometry effects in loop quantum gravity , for example see @xcite , or those from the braneworlds @xcite . at small energy densities ,",
    "we recover the standard friedmann equations .",
    "however at high densities a new effect appears : for @xmath12 , there is a critical point @xmath65 at @xmath66 where @xmath67 and we have assumed a barotropic equation of state @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . in the very early universe , @xmath2 is an explicit cutoff in the energy density .",
    "in fact in this era @xmath70 and the maximum energy density is @xmath71 . in other words",
    ", this means that the early radiation dominated universe does not start from a singularity .",
    "more surprisingly , the universe passes across a regular bounce at this point .",
    "one may easily verify that at this point @xmath72 .",
    "fortunately , in the radiation dominated universe the field equations and can be exactly solved .",
    "the result is @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we recall that the corresponding solution in @xmath4cdm model is @xmath75 .",
    "the main difference is that unlike the @xmath4cdm case , @xmath76 is positive in emsg .",
    "this is reminiscent of an inflationary epoch without any scalar field .",
    "note that the effective energy density and pressure remain also finite and all effective energy conditions fail at the bounce .",
    "the effective energy density and pressure , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are defined using the effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath27 . at the bounce we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that the null energy condition is violated .",
    "it is well known that in bouncing cosmologies one or more energy conditions are violated @xcite . for generalized energy conditions in modified theories of gravity",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in this theory , existence of a positive cosmological constant is necessary for preventing the singularity .",
    "in fact the repulsive nature of the cosmological constant plays an important role here . on the other hand , in the @xmath4cdm model ,",
    "@xmath4 does not have a significant effect in the early universe and its role is dominant at sufficiently the late times .",
    "a maximum in energy density naturally implies a minimum value for the cosmic scale factor .",
    "here we estimate this minimum length @xmath3 . as we mentioned before , in emsg the perfect fluid does not satisfy the standard conservation laws . for a two component cosmic fluid ,",
    "the conservation equation @xmath29 includes some interaction terms proportional to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the matter energy density .",
    "one may equally distribute these interaction terms between two energy components . in this case",
    "the conservation equation can be split up into two separate equations @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath88 . for small @xmath89",
    "we recover the conventional conservation equations .",
    "these conservation equations are complicated and so it is not easy to find the exact value of @xmath3 . in order to obtain an estimate for @xmath3 , we neglect @xmath90 in the conservation equation of the radiation .",
    "this assumption makes sense because @xmath90 is very smaller than @xmath91 in the beginning and it decreases even more after the bounce .",
    "therefore , although eventually @xmath91 will fall bellow @xmath90 , during a long period of time compared to the age of the universe this approximation holds . in this case",
    ", equation can be expressed as @xmath92 by retaining only the dominant term on the right hand side , we find @xmath93 finally one may simply show that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the radiation density parameter and subscript @xmath96 denotes the present value of the quantities .",
    "this is the minimum length in the cosmology of emsg .",
    "although this theory avoids the singularity , it should possess a valid expansion history .",
    "in other words , it must start with a radiation era .",
    "also it has to possess a mater dominated era followed by an accelerated expansion . in principle",
    ", the correction terms in the new friedmann equations can destroy the standard thermal history . in order to check this important requirement and to determine whether emsg provides a viable alternative to the standard model",
    ", we use _ dynamical system analysis _ @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the finite dynamical systems analysis is to provide a fast and numerically reliable integration of the modified friedmann equations .",
    "using this method , one may link the early and late time evolution of the model by analyzing the fixed points in the compact phase - space of the model , for example see @xcite .",
    "the expansion history can then be easily compared to the standard @xmath4cdm model .",
    "this method has been applied to several alternative theories and cosmological models , for example see @xcite .",
    "we use cosmic density parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 as phase space variables . using modified friedmann equations and and also the corresponding conservation equations for matter and radiation and",
    ", one can find three autonomous equations .",
    "these equations take the following form @xmath100 where functions @xmath101 are given by    @xmath102    where @xmath103",
    "it is interesting that although the field equations and conservation equations seem complicated , as we will show , the cosmological behavior of the model is close to the @xmath4cdm model .    in order to find the critical / fixed points of the dynamical system ,",
    "it is just enough to set to zero functions @xmath101 and find the relevant roots",
    ". then we can determine whether the system approaches one of the critical points or not by analyzing the stability around the critical points .",
    "let us consider small perturbations @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 around the critical point @xmath107 , namely @xmath108 substituting into equations yields to the linear differential equations @xmath109 the stability matrix @xmath110 depends upon @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and is given by @xmath114 for each fixed point , this matrix possesses three eigenvalues .",
    "the fixed point is stable / attractor if all the eigenvalues are negative and is unstable if there is at leas one positive eigenvalue .",
    "we have found the critical points and developed the stability matrix .",
    "here are the results : as in the @xmath4cdm model there are two repulsive critical points @xmath115 , @xmath116",
    ". the eigenvalues for theses points are @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "as it is clear , @xmath119 corresponds to a standard unstable radiation dominated era , and @xmath120 is a true unstable matter dominated point .",
    "in fact the effective equation of state parameter @xmath121 , see for definition , for @xmath119 is equal to @xmath122 ( this is also evident from fig [ 3 ] ) .",
    "therefore the cosmic scale factor grows as @xmath123 .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath120 we have @xmath124 and therefore @xmath125 .",
    "also there is a late time attractor @xmath126 . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath127 .",
    "this point corresponds to a late time de sitter expansion .",
    "let us recall again that @xmath4 has a twofold task in this model , providing a regular bounce and triggering the late time cosmic speed up .",
    "it is also necessary to check the behavior of this system at `` infinity '' .",
    "note that at the bounce the phase variables become infinite and thus they do not make a compact phase space . in order to demonstrate the main features of the system in a compact region ( a sphere with radius @xmath128 ) including the infinity",
    ", we use the poincar coordinates , obtained by the transformation @xmath129 . using these new variables",
    "it becomes clear that there is another unstable radiation dominated fixed point at infinity , i.e. @xmath130 . in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] we show a 2-dimensional phase space plot .",
    "the above mentioned critical points have been shown in this phase plot .",
    "therefore we see that the evolution can be started from @xmath131 and rapidly repels away from it and is followed by a standard radiation dominated epoch @xmath119 .",
    "then the models enters the matter era @xmath120 and finally falls into the late time de sitter attractor @xmath132 . in fact after the rapid evolution from @xmath131 to @xmath119 , the system follows standard trajectories similar to @xmath4cdm model . in fig .",
    "[ 2 ] we have plotted the evolution of the cosmic density parameters for a specific choice of initial conditions . as it is clear from this figure , after a rapid decrease in @xmath133 system evolves as standard cosmological model and the current values of the density parameters can match the observed values .    in order to emphasize that emsg with a bare cosmological constant does not disturb the standard cosmic evolution after the bounce",
    ", we have plotted the behavior of the deceleration parameter @xmath134 and the effective equation of state parameter @xmath121 in fig .",
    "these parameters belong to the numerical solution presented in fig [ 2 ] .",
    "we recall that @xmath135 these parameters can be written with respect to the phase space variables .",
    "since the relevant expressions are too long , we have not written them . in fig .",
    "[ 3 ] , the solid lines correspond to emsg and the dashed curves correspond to @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the purple regions demonstrate the approximate time intervals for which the system is close to its critical points .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the autonomous equations in @xmath4cdm model can be obtained from by considering the limit @xmath136 . in fig",
    "[ 3 ] , the initial conditions in @xmath4cdm model are chosen in a way to lead the same values as in emsg for the cosmic density parameters , i.e. @xmath137 , at present epoch @xmath138 .",
    "as it is obvious , @xmath134 and @xmath121 are exactly the same in both theories .",
    "this means that the growth rate of the cosmic scale factor in emsg coincides with the standard case .",
    "consequently after the bounce the thermal history of the universe is the same .",
    "it should be noted that this behavior does not belong only to the above mentioned initial condition , and we have checked it for several initial conditions .    before closing this section",
    "we remind that for the whole description presented in this section , we assumed @xmath12 .",
    "however as we mentioned before , there is no a - priori reason why this parameter should be positive .",
    "however if @xmath11 then using one can conclude that there will not be a bounce in this theory .",
    "more importantly using the dynamical system approach we found that there is no stable late time accelerated expansion in this case .",
    "it should be notes for @xmath11 the autonomous differential equations can be simply obtained from by replacing @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "where @xmath141 is @xmath142 then finding the fixed points and their stability is completely similar to the @xmath12 case .",
    "there are three fixed points @xmath143 as @xmath144 @xmath145 corresponds to an unstable radiation dominated phase , and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 is an unstable matter dominated phase with two positive eigenvalues @xmath148 . as expected , these points are unstable .    on the other hand , @xmath149 is not a fixed point but a fixed `` line '' .",
    "this line exists provided that @xmath150 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath151 .",
    "surprisingly , all the points on this curve are unstable even the point @xmath152 .",
    "this means that the late time de sitter universe is not stable when @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting that the correction terms in emsg , which are expected to be important in early times , substantially disturb the standard paradigm specially in the late times . as a final remark on the cosmology of emsg",
    ", we should stress that these conclusions are true only for a bare cosmological constant .",
    "in the presence of the other fields and the vacuum energy density , in principle , the cosmological consequences would be different .",
    "as we mentioned before , we expect that in high density regions , for example within a black hole , emsg to be different form gr . on the other hand , it is obvious that in the vacuum , where the matter energy density is zero , emsg is equivalent to gr",
    ". consequently , schwarzschild - de sitter metric and kerr metric are also solutions for emsg field equations . in order to show some interesting differences of these two theories ,",
    "let us examine a charged black hole .",
    "outside the black hole there exists matter field ( @xmath153 ) , i.e. the electromagnetic field with lagrangian density @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "it is important to mention that emsg not only changes the gravitational theory but somehow postulates a universal modification to all matter field s equations of motion . in the case of the electromagnetic filed",
    ", emsg adds some non - linear terms to maxwell equations . in this sense , emsg is reminiscent of the born - infeld non - linear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "albeit the field equations are different .",
    "more specifically , as we will show , unlike the born - infeld theory emsg does not lead to a non - singular electric field for a point charge . using the above",
    "mentioned lagrangian for the electrodynamics we have @xmath156 one can simply show that @xmath157 .",
    "therefore @xmath158 on the other hand @xmath159 consequently @xmath160 takes the following form @xmath161 also after some algebra we find @xmath162 therefore the field equations can be rewritten as @xmath163 although these field equations seem very complicated , they can be solved analytically for a charged black hole .",
    "now we need the generalized form of the maxwell equations .",
    "we recall again that emsg not only changes the gravitational filed equations but also modifies the matter field equations in the high curvature regime . to find the modified electrodynamic field equations in the vacuum , we need to vary the following part of the action with respect to @xmath164 @xmath165 variation leads to the following euler - lagrange equation",
    "@xmath166 note that @xmath167 .",
    "also we remind that @xmath168 using this equation it is straightforward to obtain @xmath169 finally the modified version of the maxwell equations in the vacuum are @xmath170 \\label{maxwell}\\ ] ] @xmath171}=0 \\label{max2}\\ ] ] equations are geometrical equations valid independently of the lagrangian chosen .",
    "equations and are coupled to equations .",
    "in fact @xmath172 enters the gravitational field equations and the metric @xmath173 enters the electromagnetic field equations through the covariant derivative .",
    "these equations , i.e. , and , form a complete set of differential equations to obtain the metric components and the electromagnetic fields . from equations it is clear that the correction term is proportional to @xmath174 . therefore ,",
    "as expected , in low energy regimes there would be no deviations from standard electrodynamics .",
    "now , let us start with a spherically symmetric space - time as @xmath175 as in gr , regarding the spherical symmetry of the metric , one may use the following components for @xmath172 : @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the electric field , and the other components are all zero . with this choice ,",
    "the equations are automatically satisfied . also from the field equations , it turns out straightforwardly that @xmath178 . on the other hand equation",
    "has only one nonzero component as @xmath179 fortunately this equation can be integrated and the solution is @xmath180 where the new parameter @xmath181 is defined as @xmath182 , and @xmath134 is the integration constant . as we will see @xmath134",
    "is related to the total electric charge of the black hole .    on the other hand ,",
    "the field equations lead to two independent differential equations .",
    "more specifically , @xmath183 and @xmath184 components lead to a same equation and @xmath185 and @xmath186 components lead to another independent equation . @xmath183 and",
    "@xmath185 components are respectively @xmath187 @xmath188 at the first glance it seems that we have two differential equations for one unknown function @xmath189 .",
    "however , one may easily show that equation is not also independent equation .",
    "in fact differentiating with respect to @xmath190 and combining with , we get equation .",
    "hence we need to solve only equation .",
    "the solution can be expressed as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the `` mass '' .",
    "note that the electric field is singular at @xmath193 .",
    "one may easily verify that for small @xmath194 the reissner - nordstrom metric is recovered .",
    "in fact the expansion of @xmath189 and the electric field @xmath177 to the first order of @xmath194 is @xmath195 the metric is still singular at @xmath193 . however",
    ", this singularity is inside the horizon .",
    "since this solution is an exterior solution to a charged black hole , the @xmath193 singularity does not imply a singular solution .",
    "one needs to find interior solutions in the presence of normal matter in order to check the singularity structure of emsg .",
    "for example the singularity - free expanding / collapsing frw universe that we have already explored in this paper lies in this category .",
    "therefore if a finite maximum density arises in the interior solutions , more specifically in the gravitational collapse , then emsg propose an entirely singularity - free universe .",
    "in this paper a new covariant generalization of gr is developed .",
    "this theory allows the existence of a term proportional to @xmath0 in the action .",
    "therefore we referred to this theory as energy - momentum squared gravity ( emsg ) .",
    "emsg is different from gr only in the presence of matter sources . in this theory",
    "the correction term can be defined only when the lagrangian density for the matter content is specified . therefore in order to find the field equations , one must first vary the matter action with respect to the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "although this feature is not the case in gr , it appears in theories which introduce correction terms including the energy - momentum tensor in the generic action    applying this theory to a homogeneous and isotropic space - time , we find that there is a maximum energy density @xmath2 , and correspondingly a minimum length scale @xmath3 , at early universe . in other words , we showed that there is a bounce at early times and consequently the early time singularity is avoided .",
    "we found the exact value of @xmath2 .",
    "also we estimated the minimum value of the cosmic scale factor .",
    "moreover , the dynamical system method has been used to investigate the cosmological behavior of emsg .",
    "it turned out that emsg possesses a true sequence of cosmological eras ( or fixed points ) . comparing to @xmath4cdm model",
    ", there is an extra duty for the cosmological constant in this theory .",
    "in fact , a positive @xmath4 is necessary for the existence of a regular bounce at early universe .",
    "also an exact solution for a charged black hole has been found .",
    "we recall that schwarzschild and kerr metrics are also solutions for emsg field equations . however , the charged black hole solution in emsg is different from the standard reissner - nordstrm space - time .    as a further study",
    "it is needed to check the existence of stable compact stars in emsg ; for such a study in the context of eibi see @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to investigate the consequences of the rapid decrease of @xmath98 and the accelerated expansion right after the bounce .",
    "finally one may expect quantum effects to become important at ultra - short distances and ultra - high energy densities .",
    "although in order to avoid these effects one may require @xmath196 and @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the planck density and @xmath199 the plancklength . using the current value of the radiation energy density and scaling @xmath200",
    ", one can easily show that if @xmath201 then both conditions are satisfied .",
    "if this constraint is consistent with the cosmological observations , then , in emsg , the universe may not enter a quantum era during its evolution .",
