    "tomorrow , a gamma ray burst ( grb ) may be observed that originates from the death of one of the first stars , during the epoch of reionisation . despite the great distance to this burst",
    ", it will be the brightest gamma ray source on the sky for several tens of seconds , one of the brightest cosmological x - ray sources for hours , and its afterglow will be observable for weeks in the near - infrared ( and , for the first few hours , brighter than any @xmath8 qso ) .",
    "much of the optical and near - infrared light will be obscured by the ly@xmath0 forest , and this obscuration will enable the strongest constraint to date on the neutral hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at the burst s redshift .",
    "in fact , such an occurrence may already have been realised .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite observed and analysed the optical / near - infrared afterglow of grb050904 , identified to be at @xmath9  possibly during the reionisation epoch and the grb with the highest confirmed redshift .",
    "@xcite derived the constraint on the global neutral fraction @xmath10 at @xmath3 . in this paper , we discuss the assumptions that went into their analysis , and we investigate how realistic modelling of reionisation can affect constraints on @xmath1 from grb050904 and from future @xmath11 grbs .    the swift satellite has greatly increased the sample of grbs with known redshifts in the last two years @xcite .",
    "future missions such as exist @xcite and jwst @xcite will further enhance our ability to detect high - redshift grbs and will enable more detailed follow - up studies of their near - infrared afterglows .",
    "interestingly , approximately one - half of swift bursts are `` dark bursts ''  bursts that have detected x - ray afterglows , but that have no measurable optical emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while it is probable that most dark bursts originate from low - redshift , dust - rich galaxies , a fraction of dark bursts may originate from @xmath11 and are `` dark '' because ly@xmath0 absorption from the high - redshift igm absorbs the optical emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to their extreme luminosity , there are several other advantages to studying reionisation with grbs compared to other probes of this epoch .",
    "first , the afterglows of high - redshift grbs are observed at earlier ( brighter ) times in the source frame than those at lower redshifts , so the dimming owing to increased luminosity distance is nearly cancelled , and the observed flux is almost independent of redshift @xcite .",
    "second , unlike the spectra of galaxies and quasars , the intrinsic afterglow spectrum of a grb is a featureless power - law at the relevant wavelengths , allowing a more precise measurement of absorption owing to a neutral igm @xcite .",
    "finally , since the theoretical expectation is that most of the star formation at @xmath12 occurs in halos with @xmath13 and because observations at @xmath12 currently probe only the most massive galaxies and qsos ( @xmath14 ) , high - redshift grb host galaxies should be less massive than galaxies selected in another manner .",
    "consequently , grb host galaxies will sit in smaller hii regions during reionisation ( on average ) than galaxies selected by different means .",
    "therefore , grbs will suffer a larger ly@xmath0 igm absorption feature .    in this work , we do not concentrate on wavelengths blueward of source - frame ly@xmath0 ( in the ly@xmath0 forest ) to derive constraints from grbs .",
    "any blueward flux indicates the presence of ionised gas at the redshift of the transmission .",
    "however , at high redshifts there is little or no flux in the ly@xmath0 forest , even in ionised regions , owing to the increase in density with increasing redshift , the decrease in the size and in the number of voids , and the decrease in the amplitude of the ionising background ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . as a result , it is difficult to distinguish a partly ionised igm from a fully ionised one with the @xmath15 forest @xcite .",
    "future observations of the @xmath16 ly@xmath0 forest from additional qsos and grbs will aid reionisation studies , but is unclear whether such studies will ever provide definitive evidence for neutral pockets in the igm . in contrast , the shape of the line profile redward of ly@xmath0 _ is _ sensitive to a substantially neutral igm and , therefore , can be used to unambiguously detect reionisation @xcite .",
    "little is known about the rate of grbs at @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the rate of long grbs traces the massive star formation rate ( sfr ) for most calculations in this work .",
    "the assumption that the grb rate traces the massive sfr is supported by observations of lower redshift grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that the grb rate is four times higher at @xmath17 than if the grb rate exactly traces the sfr .",
    "other properties of a galaxy apart from its massive sfr might be correlated with its rate of grbs .",
    "for example , @xcite found that @xmath18 grbs  grbs that are typically under - luminous  are preferentially in metal - poor galaxies .    making the assumption that the grb rate traces the observed sfr",
    ", @xcite predicted that swift will be triggered by @xmath19 bursts a year above @xmath20 identified @xmath16 bursts in three years , but it is possible that these numbers can be reconciled in light of these dark bursts . ] and that the exist mission would observe @xmath21 bursts a year .",
    "other studies have predicted even larger rates @xcite .    at @xmath15 ,",
    "popiii stars with average masses of @xmath22 may exist .",
    "it is unclear whether the death of a popiii star can result in a grb .",
    "@xcite identified a mechanism that might produce grbs from popiii stars .",
    "however , once the interstellar metallicity reaches a critical value of @xmath23 solar in a high - redshift galaxy , popiii star formation quenches and the normal mode of popii star formation begins ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and this mode _ is _ known to produce grbs .",
    "most if not all of reionisation likely owes to photons from popii - like stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in section [ redwing ] , we discuss the absorption profiles of a neutral igm as well as of a damped ly@xmath0 absorber ( dla ) , and , in section [ reionisation ] , we discuss our simulations of reionisation and their implications for the amount of igm absorption in a grb afterglow spectrum .",
    "section [ fits ] quantifies the detectability of a neutral igm from grb afterglow spectra , and section [ grb050904 ] describes the constraints on @xmath1 from the @xmath24 burst , grb050904 . for our calculations ,",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , which is consistent with the most recent cosmic microwave background and large scale structure data @xcite .",
    "we express all distances in comoving units unless otherwise noted .",
    "when this project was nearing completion , we learned of a similar effort by @xcite and refer the reader there for a complementary discussion .",
    "in the standard picture , grb afterglows result from shells of relativistic matter colliding with the interstellar medium , shocking , and radiating via synchrotron emission @xcite . the observed flux of a grb just redward of grb - frame ly@xmath0",
    "is given roughly by @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is a time - dependent amplitude , @xmath33 is a time - dependent power - law index , @xmath34 is the frequency at the ly@xmath0 line centre , and @xmath35 here , @xmath36 , @xmath37 [ @xmath38 is the redshift of the grb host galaxy [ dla ] , @xmath39 is the lorentzian - like ly@xmath0 naturally broadened scattering cross section at frequency @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the line - of - sight peculiar velocity of the gas .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : tau ] ) owes to igm absorption and the second owes to absorption by a dla with column density @xmath42 .",
    "the extended absorption profile redward of ly@xmath0 shaped by the factor @xmath43 $ ] is commonly referred to as the `` damping wing '' .",
    "let us first ignore absorption owing to a dla and the effects of peculiar velocities . for an isolated bubble of comoving size @xmath44 in a homogeneous medium with",
    "neutral fraction @xmath1 , equation ( [ eqn : tau ] ) simplifies to the expression ( e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath45    or @xmath46 for a @xmath47 proper mpc bubble , noting that @xmath48 km s@xmath49 proper mpc@xmath49 . ) , approximate @xmath50 with a lorentzian profile and ignore the redshift dependence that appears in the numerator of the integrand in equation ( [ eqn : tau ] ) .",
    "we have checked that these approximations are accurate to better than @xmath51 for relevant @xmath44 . ]",
    "the width of the damping wing feature from a neutral igm ( defined here as the the wavelength for which @xmath43 < 0.9 $ ] ) is @xmath52 .",
    "the width of this feature is typically broader than the feature due to a dla , which falls off as @xmath53 rather than the @xmath54 scaling for igm absorption , where @xmath55 is the difference between a given wavelength and that of ly@xmath0 in the grb - frame @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : params ] illustrates the effect of the column density of the dla ( top panel ) and the size of the hii region ( bottom panel ) on the absorption feature .",
    "here we adopt the same simplistic parameterisation as in equation ( [ eqn : tau2 ] ) : an hii region of size @xmath44 surrounded by a homogeneously neutral igm with neutral fraction @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed lines in the top panel represent an igm with @xmath56 , and the solid lines represent the case with @xmath4 and @xmath57 mpc .",
    "igm absorption produces a wider feature than that from a dla .",
    "however , it becomes hard to visually discern absorption owing to a neutral igm for @xmath58 .",
    "this illustration suggests that it is difficult to measure @xmath1 from grb050904 , which has @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "we return to this point in section [ grb050904 ] .",
    "dlas with @xmath60 are associated with all but one grb for which @xmath42 has been measured @xcite .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath42 for the current sample of @xmath7 grb dlas scales as @xmath61 between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and about half of all grbs for which @xmath42 has been measured have @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how @xmath42 should scale with redshift .",
    "it is plausible that , since the average galaxy becomes less massive with redshift , @xmath16 galaxies should , on average , have weaker dlas .",
    "for galaxies to reionise the universe , the escape fraction of ionising photons must be appreciable , implying that sight - lines with @xmath65 must exist . @xmath66 . ]    the bottom panel in figure [ fig : params ] depicts the effect of bubble size on the grb afterglow spectrum .",
    "the igm absorption for grbs in bubbles with sizes between @xmath47-@xmath67 is comparable .",
    "however , if the grb sits in a large bubble with @xmath68 , the absorption is strongly diminished . when @xmath69 , roughly half of the skewers from grbs in our simulations of reionisation sit in hii regions that are larger than @xmath70 mpc ( section [ reionisation ] ) .",
    "while the grb itself does not ionise the igm around it , earlier star formation from its host and neighbouring galaxies can grow a large hii region . to model reionisation around a grb",
    ", we employ three radiative transfer simulations that are each @xmath71 on a side .",
    "these simulations are post - processed on a @xmath72 particle n - body field .",
    "unresolved halos are included with extended press - schechter merger trees .",
    "these three simulations are described in detail in @xcite [ and the methodology is described in @xcite ] , and they are meant to span the range of plausible morphologies for reionisation by galaxies . here is a brief description of the models for the sources and sinks of ionising photons used in each of the three simulations :    model ( i ) : : :    all halos above the mass at which the gas can cool atomically    ( @xmath73 ) contribute ionising photons at a rate    that is proportional to their mass @xmath74 .",
    "the scaling    @xmath75 assumes that the massive sfr is proportional to the    amount of gas within a galaxy . model ( ii ) : : :    halos more massive than @xmath73 contribute to the    production of ionising photons , with the ionising luminosity of the    sources scaling as halo mass to the @xmath76 power .",
    "this    scaling is chosen to match the relationship between star formation    efficiency and galaxy mass that is observed in low - redshift dwarf    galaxies @xcite as well as the sfr found in theoretical studies that    include supernova feedback @xcite . model ( iii ) : : :    absorption by minihalos shapes the morphology of reionisation and    @xmath77 for    @xmath78 .",
    "all minihalos with    @xmath79 absorb incident ionising photons out    to their virial radii until they are photo - evaporated .",
    "we use the    fitting formula for the evaporation timescale given in @xcite .",
    "this    timescale is roughly the sound - crossing time of a halo , or    @xmath80    @xcite .",
    "the normalisation of the function @xmath81 in the three simulations is chosen such that reionisation is completed by @xmath82 .",
    "given the uncertainties in @xmath83  the fraction of ionising photons that escape and ionise the igm  and in the sfr in high - redshift galaxies , there is a large range of possible normalisations .",
    "fortunately , the morphology of reionisation when comparing at fixed @xmath1 depends only weakly on the normalisation of @xmath84 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also showed that other effects such as thermal feedback on sub - jeans mass galaxies , source duty cycle , and the number of recombinations have negligible impact on the morphology for reasonable models .",
    "in fact , studies have demonstrated that the morphology of reionisation is shaped principally by the clustering of the ionising sources @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : slice ] displays slices through simulations adopting reionisation models ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) .",
    "the white regions are ionised and the black are neutral .",
    "model ( ii ) results in the largest hii regions because it has the most biased sources , whereas model ( iii ) produces the smallest bubbles , with the maximum bubble radius restricted to be roughly the mean free path for ionising photons to intersect a minihalo .",
    "the absorption profile of a grb afterglow probes a line of sight through the igm .",
    "most of the absorption from the igm occurs at @xmath85 from the host galaxy , and the neutral regions in the igm that lie closer to the grb contribute more absorption than those further away .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : slice ] that different sight - lines encounter vastly different spatial distributions of @xmath86 . to further illustrate this point , figure [ fig : skewer ] displays nine randomly selected @xmath87 skewers originating at a potential grb site in the simulation volume .",
    "these skewers are from the @xmath88 snapshot of the simulation using model ( i ) for which the volume - averaged neutral fraction is @xmath89 and the mass - averaged neutral fraction is @xmath90.s and @xmath47s",
    ". this smearing does not appreciably affect the results of the calculations reported here . ] henceforth , @xmath91 refers to the volume - averaged neutral fraction . to assign locations for grbs in the simulation volume",
    ", we assume that the @xmath84 of a halo is proportional to the grb rate ( which is true if the grb rate traces the massive sfr and @xmath83 is independent of halo mass ) .",
    "figure [ fig:9spectra ] plots the igm transmission redward of ly@xmath0 for the nine grb sight - lines shown in figure [ fig : skewer ] .",
    "to compute these curves , we use equation ( 1 ) and the density , ionisation , and velocity fields from the simulation .",
    "the observed transmission across these six lines of sight varies enormously , and this variance needs to be accounted for in measurements of @xmath1 using grbs . these calculations do not account for the evolution in @xmath1 along the line of sight owing to light - travel effects , but instead compute the absorption from a skewer using a snapshot that is fixed in time . in the time for light to travel @xmath92 , the value of @xmath1 in the simulations of model ( i ) changes by @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 when @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "a proper treatment of the evolution of @xmath1 along a sight - line would hardly affect our conclusions .",
    "for the nine sight - lines in figure [ fig : skewer ] , the best fit @xmath99 to the afterglow transmission redward of ly@xmath0 are respectively @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "are anomalous , and the total fraction of lines of sight that are best fit with @xmath109 is a much smaller fraction than suggested by this sample of nine sight - lines . ]",
    "while these two parameters do not fully characterise the distribution of @xmath1 , the actual value for @xmath44 of the grb host bubble corresponds roughly to the size given by these fits and the fitted value for @xmath1 is within @xmath110 of the global value . in reality",
    ", a dla will also affect the damping wing profile , and its absorption must be accounted for simultaneously .",
    "we incorporate this extra complication in the following section .",
    "the top left panel in figure [ fig : rb ] plots the probability distribution of grb host hii bubble radii , @xmath111 .",
    "the grb host bubble radius is defined as the distance it requires for a skewer to cross three simulation grid cells that are more than @xmath112 neutral .",
    "the dashed , solid , and dot - dashed curves are @xmath113 for @xmath114 , @xmath97 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "the thick curves are for model ( i ) , and the medium width and thin solid curves ( shown for only @xmath89 ) adopt model ( ii ) and model ( iii ) , respectively .",
    "these curves demonstrate that the function @xmath111 depends more strongly on @xmath1 than on the reionisation model .",
    "when @xmath116 , the typical grb resides in a bubble of size @xmath117 , and when @xmath118 this number increases to @xmath119 .",

    "we generate @xmath120 skewers that originate at grbs in the simulation volume and then tabulate @xmath1 along each skewer , weighting points as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the distance from the source  roughly the same weighting that is relevant to the damping wing optical depth at observed frequency @xmath123 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tau2 ] ) .",
    "we do not include points inside the host bubble in this tabulation .",
    "the wide breadth of the @xmath1 distributions indicate that a single grb can not be used to directly measure the global value of @xmath1 to a precision of @xmath124 . despite the scatter in @xmath1",
    ", a single grb can be used to detect whether the igm is neutral .",
    "we focus on the probability of a grb allowing the detection of reionisation in the next section .",
    "it is possible that grbs occur in only the most massive galaxies ( rather than in a typical one , as we have assumed thus far ) .",
    "if only halos with @xmath125 are able to produce grbs with a rate proportional to the halo mass , again weighting these halos by their sfr , we find that the average bubble size increases by a comparable amount to the size increase between model ( i ) and model ( ii ) shown in figure [ fig : rb ] .",
    "however , we find that the low - end tail of @xmath111 starts to disappear with increasing @xmath74 , even though the peak of the pdf does not shift significantly .",
    "thus far , we have discussed the distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath44 measured directly from the simulations . for a grb afterglow , @xmath1 and @xmath44 are measured by fitting these parameters to the afterglow damping wing ( even though this parameterisation for the distribution of @xmath86 along a sight - line is highly simplified ) .",

    "we ignore the effect of dla absorption in these fits .",
    "these pdfs are notably different from those in the top panels  favouring smaller @xmath44 and lower @xmath1 . while this procedure returns biased values for @xmath44 and @xmath1 relative to the values we estimate in the top panel",
    ", we find that this two parameter model provides an excellent fit to the absorption profile ( as we discuss in section [ fits ] ) .",
    "this section quantifies the circumstances under which a grb afterglow can be used to detect a neutral igm .",
    "previous sections have illustrated how the patchiness of the igm and the strength of the host dla complicate this measurement .",
    "in addition , there are other uncertainties such as the power - law slope and amplitude of the intrinsic grb spectrum , the precise redshift of the grb and of the dla , and dust absorption and metal line contamination from the host galaxy or from intervening systems .",
    "a systematic discussion of these issues is presented in @xcite . to rule out an ionised igm with a grb afterglow , a multi - parameter fit to its spectrum that assumes an ionised igm and that accounts for the aforementioned uncertainties must provide a poor fit .",

    "such uncertainties must be accounted for in any analysis that attempts to obtain @xmath1 from the damping wing absorption profile of a galaxy .",
    "grbs are the most luminous sources at high redshifts , and their smooth power - law spectra are ideal for isolating the effects of absorption owing to a neutral igm .",
    "however , observations must separate the impact of igm absorption from that of a dla to detect a neutral igm .",
    "if no damping wing feature from igm absorption is detected in the spectrum of a high - redshift grb , one must be careful to conclude that reionisation is complete at the redshift of interest .",
    "we have shown that there is a wide probability distribution of hii region sizes , and that there is large variation in the distribution of @xmath1 along different sight - lines .",
    "a non - detection of neutral hydrogen from a grb afterglow spectrum might arise because the grb host galaxy sits within a large hii region .",
