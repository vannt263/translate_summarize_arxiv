    "deep sub - mm surveys with scuba have detected distant luminous galaxies which emit most of their energy at far infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , smail et al .",
    "1997 ; barger et al .",
    "1998 , hughes et al .",
    "1998 , eales et al .",
    "although some of these sources have been identified with very faint and sometimes very red optical counterparts ( smail et al .",
    "1999 ) their poorly constrained redshift distribution ( barger et al .  1999 ,",
    "smail et al .",
    "2000 ) has made their interpretation unclear .",
    "bright distant scuba sources appear similar to local ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( e.g.  sanders 2000 ) , but represent a more significant fraction of the global star formation at high redshift .",
    "how these differ at high @xmath7 , and how they are related to optically selected galaxies remains to be understood",
    ".    we might expect such luminous sub - mm sources to be especially prevalent in regions that will one day become rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "for instance , if early type galaxies ( which are dominant only in rich cluster environments ) form by major merger events , then during the epoch of their formation they might produce a large fraction of the bright sub - mm sources in the universe .",
    "there might therefore be a strong clustering signal from sub - mm sources at high redshift ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) . even if the sub - mm sources are primarily agn - driven , we might expect them to be strongly clustered , given the bulge to black hole mass correlations ( cf .",
    ", gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "since it is not yet possible to measure the clustering properties of sub - mm sources , the next best approach is to examine regions that are already known to be overdense from other techniques .",
    "the most likely time in a cluster s history for a bright sub - mm phase is when smaller groups are collapsing , prior to virialization of the whole proto - cluster environment , when compact groups of objects with relatively low velocity dispersion present high probabilities for merger events .",
    "therefore , galaxy concentrations within known large - scale overdensities are good places to search for significant sub - mm emission .",
    "extensive spectroscopic surveys have recently shown strong clustering among the star forming lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) population at @xmath8 ( e.g. , adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) . in one striking example",
    ", a high - contrast redshift overdensity of lbgs at @xmath6 in the ssa22 survey field was discovered ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) , with deep , narrow band ly@xmath1  imaging used to identify at least 160 likely members of this structure ( steidel et al .",
    "most dramatic in this @xmath6 spike was the discovery of two extensive ( @xmath0kpc ) , highly luminous ( @xmath9w ) ` blobs ' of ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "the ` blobs ' resemble the giant ly@xmath1 nebulae associated with high redshift radio galaxies ( cf .",
    "van ojik et al .  1996 ) , but have @xmath101% of the associated radio continuum flux and no obvious source of uv photons bright enough to excite the nebular emission .",
    "fabian et al .  (",
    "1986 ) suggested that such extended emission line nebulae might be the signature of ` maximal cooling flows ' in proto - cluster and proto - galaxy environments  these ` blobs ' resemble just such objects .",
    "the ssa22 @xmath11 arcmin field at @xmath123.11 is a factor of 6 overdense in lbgs relative to the general field , and about twice as overdense again within the local density peak centered on ` blob  1 ' . at present , the ssa22 structure is by far the best studied candidate for a clustered region at @xmath13 .",
    "the space density of the lbg redshift ` spikes ' is similar to that of rich x - ray clusters at low redshift , supporting the plausible identification of the lbg overdensities as proto - cluster sites .",
    "we have obtained scuba 850@xmath14 m and 450@xmath14 m maps of the ly@xmath1 blob lying at an overdensity peak within the already overdense field , revealing an extremely luminous sub - mm counterpart . in this letter , we describe the available multi - wavelength data for the blob regions and explore the relevant excitation mechanisms .",
    "the field centered on the ly@xmath1 ` blob  1 ' ( ra@xmath15 = @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 = @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 ) was observed with the scuba instrument ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the jcmt . during",
    "an observing run in may 2000 , we obtained 450 and 850@xmath4 m  images simultaneously in ` jiggle ' mode , with half - power beam widths of 7.5 and 14.7 arcsec respectively . the effective integration time ( total time spent on the map , on and off source ) was 8.2ks , reaching a 1@xmath23 sensitivity of @xmath24mjy and @xmath25mjy at 850@xmath4 m  and 450@xmath4 m  respectively .",
    "we used 45 arcsec chop throws at fixed ra and declination with position angles of 0 , 90 and 135 degrees from north , to avoid consistently chopping any structures onto each other .",
    "for the central source , the 850@xmath4 m  flux density was measured by fitting a single beam template ( derived from observing mars ) to the source in each scan and combining the results with inverse variance weighting .",
    "the fluxes are consistent with each other in each of the individual scans . since no other sources are detected in the individual scans , we simply stacked and combined the scans and similarly fit beam templates to all sources representing peaks @xmath262.8@xmath23 in the final map .",
    "in addition , a ` photometry ' observation in three - bolometer chopping mode ( see chapman et al .",
    "2000a , scott et al .",
    "2000 ) was performed on the ly@xmath1  ` blob  2 ' for an effective on - source observing time of 2.8ks , reaching an rms of 1.2mjy at 850@xmath4 m .",
    "pointing was checked hourly on blazars and a sky - dip was performed to measure the atmospheric opacity .",
    "the pointing variations were around 2 arcsec , while the average atmospheric zenith opacities at 450@xmath4 m  and 850@xmath4 m  were 1.39 and 0.22 .",
    "the data were reduced using the starlink package surf ( jenness et al .",
    "spikes were first carefully rejected from the data , followed by correction for atmospheric opacity and sky subtraction using the median of the outer ring array elements .",
    "we then weighted each pixel by its timestream inverse variance , relative to the central pixel .",
    "the multiple scans taken at dithered positions , together with sky rotation throughout the observations , ensure that each point of the map is covered by several bolometers . the data were finally calibrated against the compact region @xmath27 , observed during the same nights .",
    "archive vla data were retrieved for this field , with rms sensitivities of 60@xmath4jy at 1.4ghz and 40@xmath4jy at 8.5ghz .",
    "the beam is comparable to the scuba beam at 850@xmath4 m , but since the field was observed as a low declination snapshot , the beam is elongated to approximately @xmath28 arcsec .",
    "the visible images on which our present analysis is based were obtained using the palomar 200inch telescope with the cosmic camera .",
    "spectroscopy and near - ir imaging were obtained with the keck 10 m telescope and the lris and nirc instruments respectively , and are described elsewhere ( steidel et al .",
    "we have detected an unresolved sub - mm counterpart to the ` blob  1 ' ( smmj221726 + 0013 ) with an 850@xmath4 m  flux density of 20mjy . at @xmath6",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity @xmath29 for an @xmath30 cosmology , giving a bolometric luminosity of @xmath31 for any reasonable temperature and emissivity index .",
    "there is also a @xmath32 detection at the central position in the 450@xmath4 m  map ( 76mjy ) , which also does not appear to be extended . a scuba photometry observation of the other ly@xmath1 blob ( ` blob  2 ' )",
    "gives a @xmath33 detection of a much weaker sub - mm counterpart , @xmath34mjy .",
    "the 850@xmath4 m  and 450@xmath4 m  images of the ` blob  1 ' are presented in fig .  1 , convolved with a 14  gaussian , while the fluxes at various wavelengths for the two blob sources and surrounding sub - mm sources are listed in table  1 .",
    "other known @xmath8 objects from steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are denoted with crosses on the 850@xmath4 m  map , while a ly@xmath1  narrowband image with @xmath35-band contours and scuba error circles overlaid is presented in fig .  2 for both blobs .",
    "the extremely luminous sub - mm source appears coincident with the central ly@xmath1 knot ( ` blob  1 ' ) .",
    "although this ly@xmath1  peak remains undetected in the broadband optical to @xmath36 , it has a @xmath35-band counterpart with an associated @xmath37 .",
    "the sub - mm centroid lies only 2 arcsec from this ly@xmath1  peak , entirely consistent with the jcmt pointing errors .",
    "no radio counterpart was detected at the sensitivity limits of the vla images consistent with a high-@xmath7 emitting source .    for ` blob  2 ' , the scuba _ photometry _ observation was targeted on the ly@xmath1  center , near a weak @xmath35-band source , where we identify a possible @xmath38mjy detection .",
    "however , without higher resolution it is difficult to know which source within the @xmath39 beam is giving rise to the sub - mm emission .",
    "in particular an lbg , m14 , lies at the edge of the scuba beam , @xmath406  northeast of the ` blob  2 ' center .",
    "if m14 was generating the sub - mm flux , then the beam efficiency correction would imply an 850@xmath4 m  flux of @xmath41mjy , similar to the very red lbg ( @xmath42 ) detected by scuba ( westphal - mmd11  chapman et al .",
    "however , m14 is a very faint lbg ( @xmath43 ) and is not especially red ( @xmath44 ) , and is thus not expected to be a strong sub - mm emitter .",
    "moreover the relatively faint sub - mm emission makes it unlikely that a radio counterpart could be detectable for a @xmath8 in the archive vla maps .      as well as the central ` blob  1 ' detection",
    ", there are perhaps as many as three additional source detections ( @xmath45mjy ) in the 850@xmath4 m  map .",
    "our best attempt to describe the extended region to the west is as three separate sources in a blend ( source 3 in the table ) .",
    "however , low signal - to - noise and resolution means that this is little more than a guess .",
    "the 850@xmath4 m  blend region may be extended at 450@xmath4 m , but is detected only in the northern part .",
    "two possible sources to the nw ( 4th and 5th in the table ) appear unresolved , but are near the edge where the noise is worse and poorly defined , although source 6 appears coincident with a 450@xmath4 m  source .",
    "radio observations provide rough constraints on the redshifts of sub - mm sources ( carilli & yun 1999,2000 ; barger et al .",
    "our sub - mm detected galaxies in ssa22 have inferred bolometric luminosities several times that of arp  220 , with expected 1.4ghz radio fluxes @xmath46jy ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ) and thus lie below the detection threshold of current vla observations . applying the carilli & yun ( 2000 ) relation to provide redshift constraints from the 850@xmath4 m  detections and @xmath47ghz upper limits",
    "shows that all these sources have predicted redshifts @xmath48 .",
    "the ratio @xmath49 can also loosely constrain the source redshifts ( cf .",
    "hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) . while the central blob source , and source 4 are consistent with @xmath8 , the sources 3 and 5 in the table with 450@xmath4 m   detections have flux ratios suggesting lower redshifts . for the western blend region , confusion makes it hard to draw any inferences .",
    "the flux ratio for the northern source ( 850@xmath4 m  source 5 ) suggests a redshift less than 2 .",
    "however , the source is near the edge , identification of the 450@xmath4 m  peak with the 850@xmath4 m  source is far from certain , and the lack of an obvious radio counterpart suggests @xmath50 .",
    "turning now to optical identifications , we find no known @xmath8 optical / near - ir candidates within the error circles of these additional sub - mm source detections",
    ". the sub - mm sources may be extremely faint ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , similar to the radio selected sub - mm bright populations studied by barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and chapman et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . however , not all sub - mm sources are associated with such optically faint counterparts ( e.g. the lbg w - mmd11 , chapman et al .",
    "in addition , only about half of the blue , uv bright @xmath53 galaxies are included in lbg catalogs ( largely due to photometric errors and blending with foreground objects ) , thus it is possible that a sub - mm source could be associated with a uv bright @xmath54 galaxy even if it has no counterpart in our lbg list .",
    "the relatively low detection significance of these surrounding sub - mm sources , and the absence of any obvious counterparts at other wavelengths , suggest that we exercise caution in over - interpreting these objects . nevertheless , the number density of @xmath55mjy scuba sources is about an order of magnitude higher than in scuba blank fields ( cf .",
    "blain et al .  1999 ; barger et al .  2000",
    "; chapman et al .",
    "2000c ) ; at least some of these sources are likely to be associated with the @xmath6 structure .",
    "the central ` blob  1 ' scuba source is among the most luminous high-@xmath7 sub - mm sources known .",
    "it is especially interesting that this object was discovered through the presence of tremendous amounts of ly@xmath1  emission , usually thought of as easily destroyed by the presence of dust .",
    "this begs the question : would other bright sub - mm sources ( if their redshifts were known ) exhibit similar ly@xmath1`halos ' ?",
    "one luminous sub - mm _ selected _ source , smmj02399 - 0136 , is known to be associated with an extended ( @xmath268 ) ly@xmath1  region ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , although the actual extent has not yet been constrained through a narrow - band image .",
    "both star forming and agn components have been identified , although the primary power source for the sub - mm emission has not been constrained . a few high-@xmath7 radio galaxies with giant ly@xmath1  halos have also been detected in the sub - mm , including 4c41.17 ( chambers et al .",
    "1990 ) which has a possible ` cluster ' of sub - mm sources associated ( ivison et al .",
    "however , in the case of this ssa22 blob , the ly@xmath1  halo is hard to explain through excitation of the ambient medium by a radio jet , since there is no known radio counterpart here .",
    "archibald et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have observed a sample of high redshift radio galaxies using scuba , detecting several with known ly@xmath1  halos .",
    "the sub - mm emission from the ` blob  1 ' object is more luminous than any radio galaxy in this survey of 47 sources over @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , the lack of significant radio emission from our blob  1 scuba object suggests that the ly@xmath1  halos surrounding distant radio galaxies may not be entirely related to the radio sources .",
    "the questions of the ionizing source for the ly@xmath1 blobs and the nature of the sub - mm emission remain .",
    "the blobs are probably excited by either photoionization from a central source , or as a result of virialization in a deep potential .",
    "the sub - mm emission could be either a uv - luminous star forming galaxy or an obscured agn .",
    "more extended sub - mm emission such as from a cooling flow or even from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect are also possible .",
    "the lack of a uv source in the optical images , coupled with the large dust mass implied by the sub - mm detections , make direct photoionization of the ly@xmath1  from such a central agn or starburst difficult to imagine .",
    "however , it is conceivable that complicated geometrical and radiative transfer effects could conspire to allow substantial ly@xmath1  fluxes at the same time that the continuum sources are heavily obscured by dust along our line of sight ( e.g.  neufeld 1991 ) . the fact that the second ly@xmath1  blob is not a strong sub - mm source suggests that an obscured continuum source need not be the primary driver for the ly@xmath1  emission .    for a pure star - burst galaxy ,",
    "the star formation rate extrapolated from the sub - mm would be in excess of @xmath57 for ` blob  1 ' . by analogy with the giant ly@xmath1 halos around high-@xmath7 radio galaxies ,",
    "there is reason to suspect a luminous agn at the heart of the ly@xmath1 blob .",
    "although the redshift of the ly@xmath1  ` blob  1 ' ( @xmath6 ) is relatively high for radio detection , the farir / radio correlation for radio quiet sources ( helou et al .",
    "1995 ) suggests a 1.4ghz flux density of @xmath58jy if it is a steep spectrum object ( carilli & yun 1999 ) , and possibly a comparable 8.5ghz flux if it had the flatter spectrum characteristic of an agn .",
    "our bayesian 95% upper limits of 142@xmath4jy ( 1.4ghz ) and 95@xmath4jy ( 8.5ghz ) lie well within the uncertainties of the carilli & yun ( 2000 ) relation , and deeper observations will be required to further constrain the properties of the system .",
    "the ratio @xmath49 for the central source is @xmath59 , which is consistent with a starburst or radio quiet agn lying at @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the 850@xmath4 m  flux could be partly sunyaev - zeldovich increment , although the detection of 450@xmath4 m  flux argues against this being a significant component . on theoretical grounds , the surface brightness of the increment for rich local clusters",
    "would be expected to be around @xmath61mjy per scuba beam , and all other things being equal , s - z surface brightness is independent of redshift .",
    "the s - z signal is approximately @xmath62 : the background density is proportional to @xmath63 , and so the core of a cluster virializing at high redshift would be much denser .",
    "however , the characteristic non - linear mass in an @xmath64 universe goes like @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the power - spectrum slope .",
    "for cdm models @xmath66 is -1 to -2 on the relevant scales . hence",
    ", though the estimate is dependent on cosmology , the simple @xmath67 argument suggests that the s - z contribution is not likely to explain all our signal .",
    "the expected _ decrement _ at @xmath68ghz would be @xmath69jy , and hence at the limit of being detectable currently .",
    "if the blobs are associated with cooling - flow - like phenomena ( e.g.  hu  1992 ) , then some of the sub - mm emission could come from dust associated with distributed star - formation in the cooling flow .",
    "edge et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and chapman et al .  (",
    "2000c ) have searched for such emission in well - known rich clusters with null results . however , local cooling flow clusters are not necessarily a proper benchmark , given that the associated gas densities could conceivably be much higher at @xmath8 .",
    "fardal et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and haiman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently modelled the cooling radiation from forming galaxies and concluded that sub - virial temperatures for the gas could lead to much lower x - ray luminosities than one would expect from extrapolating local cooling flows . while it is not inconceivable that some of the flux has this source , even optimistic estimates for the strength of the signal , as discussed in the above papers , come out at a few mjy .",
    "future observations will continue to elucidate the nature of the ` blobs ' . for optically thin sub - mm emission",
    ", we can estimate the expected x - ray signal of the ` blob  1 ' sub - mm object using different analogs for the central source at @xmath6 , and representative sub - mm / x - ray indices ( cf .",
    "fabian et al .  2000 ) .",
    "even the most heavily obscured ( compton - thick ) agn , analogous to ngc6240 , should be detectable with chandra or newton with soft and hard x - ray fluxes of order @xmath70 , while an arp220 analog would be even fainter .",
    "deeper radio maps or higher frequency interferometer maps would be able to distinguish any sz component , as well as confirm the other sub - mm sources and their positions .",
    "the extreme sub - mm luminosity from the central ly@xmath1  halo in ` blob  1 ' ( and weaker emission detected from ` blob  2 ' ) is an intriguing phenomenon , given the fragility of the ly@xmath1  line in the presense of dust .",
    "this combination of deep , large - area ly@xmath1  surveys and sub - mm images may be interesting to explore further as a way of unearthing information about clusters in their early stages of formation .",
