    "the spatial distribution , size , and composition of silicate dust grains observed in circumstellar disks surrounding young pre - main - sequence stars result from a variety of physical and chemical evolutionary processes .",

    "building upon much ground - based infrared photometry and imaging sensitive to the blackbody emission and scattered light from dust grains in circumstellar environments , the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) has amassed an extensive catalog of near- to mid - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of young sources in the nearest star forming regions @xcite .",
    "modeling of the seds of this large sample of t tauri stars ( tts )  known to possess thick and actively accreting disks  succeeds in defining the spatial and size distributions of the dust grains in these systems , potentially giving astronomers direct insight into the evolutionary status of these planetary building blocks .",
    "for instance , sed models suggest the presence of ` puffed - up ' inner disk rims near the dust sublimation radius for some sources @xcite and constrain the sizes of the optically thin inner disk holes of transitional objects finding some to be as large as 40  au @xcite .",
    "in addition to the information encoded in the seds , grain sizes and composition have been inferred from mid - infrared emission features formed by the super - heated dust grains located at small radii and in the upper atmospheres of these protoplanetary disks .",
    "high - sensitivity , low - resolution spectral surveys of the 10  @xmath0 m silicate complex have provided the opportunity for in - depth analyses of compositional variations of the dust grains with the most detailed models including laboratory measured opacities for a variety of sizes and species ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the parameters returned by these models include dust temperatures and mass fractions for different grain types , sizes , and structures ( i.e. , crystalline and amorphous , small and large , forsterite , enstatite , olivine ) .",
    "less detailed compositional analyses have been conducted by binning the 10  @xmath0 m silicate complex into various wavelength regions corresponding to the peak emission of specific dust grain species . the integrated fluxes over these wavelength bins are used to compute ratios commonly referred to as crystalline indices that give an approximation of the relative abundances ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "several groups have published single - epoch _ spitzer",

    "@xcite were the first to note a relationship between the crystallinity versus amorphous nature of the silicate emission feature with the evolutionary status of the dust grain population and the disk .",
    "the presence of crystalline grains implies that the once amorphous interstellar grains have been annealed and cooled , consistent with heating in the inner regions of an evolving protoplanetary disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite concluded the same , suggesting that a disk evolutionary sequence can explain the variety of shapes observed for the silicate features in their short - low ( 5.2 - 14.5  @xmath0 m ) and long - low ( 14.0 - 38.0  @xmath0 m ) irs spectra of tts .",
    "the conclusions about the evolutionary status of the disks are based solely on single - epoch observations and do not account for the dynamic nature of the tts sources , which are characterized by multi - wavelength variability on timescales as short as days .",
    "variations of the morphology of the silicate emission feature on the timescales of days , months , or even years would likely complicate such compositional studies of dust grain populations such as those leading to the development of a disk evolutionary sequence .    in order to test the validity of the conclusions drawn from the single - epoch studies , we used _ spitzer _",

    "the unexpected short timescale variations and potential scenarios for this behavior are presented in this letter .",

    "the spectra with continuum fits in figure  [ fig : example ] illustrate the technique employed for removing the continuua from the target star spectra and demonstrate that the observed variability of the silicate feature is independent of variations in the long and short wavelength continuum regions .",
    "in order to quantify the shape of the continuua and underlying dust continuum emission , we defined two wavelength bands centered at 6.0 and 13.5  @xmath0 m with widths of 0.8 and 1.0 @xmath0 m , respectively , and the color index ( @xmath5-[13.5]$ ] ; see table  1 ) .    6.4  @xmath0 m ) and long ( 13@xmath614  @xmath0 m ) wavelength portions of the spectra . for comparison ,",
    "the residual spectra ( black dot - dashed lines ) depict the shapes and relative fluxes of the silicate features , clearly illustrating the large variability observed between these epochs of observations . ]",
    "of the 11 sources included in our program , only dg  tau and xz  tau exhibit variability of the silicate complex over month- and year - long timescales . in both systems , the silicate emission feature is observed to weaken and strengthen over the three years worth of observations , with the short wavelength portion near 9  @xmath0 m in xz  tau falling nearly to the level of the continuum .",
    "the silicate variability in the spectrum of dg  tau has previously been observed @xcite and is confirmed by these observations , while the variations in the spectra of xz  tau are observed for the first time .        using the jd  2453069 observation of xz  tau",
    ", @xcite determined that the silicate feature is dominated by amorphous grains by fitting a two - temperature blackbody with solid angle dependence and laboratory measured opacities for a variety of dust grain sizes and compositions . by inspection of the xz  tau spectra ( figure  [ fig : silew ] ) , for all epochs , this source lacks evidence of emission from crystalline forsterite at 11.3  @xmath0 m , a common signature of sources determined to possess relatively high abundances of crystalline grains @xcite . on the other hand , the silicate emission feature for dg  tau appears dominated by crystalline forsterite in all epochs of observations presented here .",
    "detailed modeling of the silicate feature is required to extract the crystalline - to - amorphous ratio and will be presented in leisenring et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colorflux ] , the silicate flux appears to be marginally correlated with the @xmath5-[13.5]$ ] color index for both dg tau and xz tau .",
    "however , such weak correlations do not provide compelling evidence for a common physical mechanism that is directly responsible for the variations in the silicate feature and also for changes in continuum emission .",

    "we obtain respective pearson correlation coefficients between these two parameters of 0.61 and 0.66 for dg  tau and xz  tau .",
    "the probabilities that these correlations could have been produced from a random distribution ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are 8.1% and 5.3% , respectively .",
    "thus , we find only a weak correlation between the strength of the silicate feature and the continuum flux . ]      in addressing the evolutionary sequence previously proposed as an explanation for the amorphous and crystalline silicate abundances , we adopted the two - temperature dust models ( including the same dust species and related opacities ) of @xcite ( see equation  1 ) and performed compositional fits to the 10  @xmath0 m silicate feature at each phase of modulation for dg  tau and xz  tau .",
    "the models returned statistically significant fits only for the epochs possessing maximum silicate emission ( dg tau : jd 2453653 and 2453659 ; xz tau : jd 2454026 and 2454031 ) .",
    "therefore , the models were unable to provide a reliable fit to the silicate feature when the emission was diminished or self - absorbed .",
    "the failure of this simple method led us to develop a two - temperature two - slab model of the dust emission from the surface of the disk . in order to produce the observed variations of the silicate feature , the top ,",
    "intervening layer was assumed to be cooler than that of the lower , emitting region .",
    "this two - slab model confidently fits all epochs of the silicate emission features for both sources , especially when both slabs possessed dust grains with similar compositions .",
    "the results of this model suggests that the observed variability can be explained by an intervening population of similarly composed cooler dust grains .",
    "therefore , the variations observed in the silicate feature do not necessarily indicate a change in the composition of the emitting grains .",
    "the introduction of an absorbing column of dust grains explains the inability of previous silicate decomposition models to fit silicate emission features in dg  tau and other similar sources @xcite .",
    "the timescales over which the variations occur strongly suggest that the phenomena associated with intervening cooler dust must occur on dynamical timescales consistent with the motion of dust in the disk at radii less than or equal to 1  au .",
    "these short timescales rule out a clumpy dust envelope as the source for the intervening column of cooler dust .",
    "this inference agrees with the findings of @xcite , in which a one - dimensional radiative transfer model showed that an envelope capable of producing the variability they observed in dg  tau would also completely obscure the star .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is unlikely that the intervening cooler grains are associated with remnants of an envelope .    in an attempt to explain day- to week - long silicate and continuum variability , @xcite",
    "discuss a scenario of disk shadowing in which a warped , puffed up region of the inner disk rim casts a shadow across a portion of the disk surface .",
    "there is potential for this phenomena to explain the longer timescale variability presented here @xcite .",
    "in addition , the recent discovery of a third companion located within 009 ( 13  au ) of the southern component of xz  tau @xcite increases the possibility for variations in disk illumination as previously described by @xcite in reference to the variability they observe in the hh  30 system .",
    "in addition to disk shadowing and illumination , turbulent mixing @xcite and the presence of dusty disk winds may also provide reasonable explanations of the observed variability .",
    "turbulent mixing in the disk capable of dredging cooler dust up to the surface of the disk may provide a plausible mechanism for varying the strength and nature ( emission versus self - absorption ) of the silicate feature .",
    "alternatively , the presence of dusty disk winds as described by @xcite may be capable of lofting material above the disk surface providing a cooler veil of similarly composed dust grains through which to view the warmer , emitting dust ; hence , producing self - absorption of the emitting silicate region . in both scenarios , the vertical mixing and disk winds must be variable to produce the inhomogeneities required to explain the observed variability of the silicate feature .",
    "given the variable nature of the accretion processes in these sources , fluctuating disk winds and vertical mixing is to be expected @xcite .",
    "the 10  @xmath0 m silicate emission complex observed in the mid - infrared spectra of classical tts and formed by super - heated dust grains in the upper atmospheres of the innermost regions of their disks can vary on month - long timescales .",
    "better temporal resolution is required to determine if the variability is periodic .",
    "our spectral decomposition models were incapable of fitting the silicate feature at every phase of modulation , suggesting that variability may be an explanation for some of the difficulties previous groups have encountered with modeling single - epoch spectra of individual stars .",
    "the simple two - slab two - temperature model suggests an optical depth effect may explain the observed variations . since the intervening cooler material may be of similar composition , the variability may not directly impact the disk evolutionary sequence previously constructed for tts , based on amorphous versus crystalline abundances and dust grain sizes .",
    "however , we note that these models require a number of parameters and the question of degenerate solutions needs to be addressed . additional multi - epoch observations of these sources and others are required to determine the fraction of disks with variable silicate emission and provide more variations to model , helping to constrain acceptable parameters . with the loss of irs on _ spitzer _ , this project will turn to ground - based observations with less sensitivity , but still the ability to measure the previously observed silicate variability .",
