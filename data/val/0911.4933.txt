    "solar cells based on conventional single - gap band - semiconductors have low internal quantum efficiency for conversion of solar into electrical energy @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the photon energy absorbed by a single electron - hole pair with energy above the semiconductor band gap is lost in heat through electron - phonon scattering and phonon emission through which electrons and holes relax to their band edges .",
    "the solar energy spectrum contains photons with energies in a rather broad energy range compared to any particular semiconductor energy gap .",
    "if instead semiconductors with a relatively large band - gap are chosen in order to avoid the above mentioned problem , this cuts off most of the energy spectrum of the solar radiation .",
    "using a stack of cascaded multiple p - n junctions with various band gaps is an expensive approach to build efficient solar cells .    a variety of other ideas",
    "have been suggested in order to increase solar cell efficiency @xcite .",
    "one particular approach which increases the photo - current is one in which the energetic carriers produce additional electron - hole pairs through impact ionization @xcite at a much faster rate than the rate characterizing the relaxation process through phonon emission . in order to achieve this",
    ", it has been suggested that @xcite using confining geometries , such as quantum wells , quantum wires , quantum dots , superlattices and nanostructures , the relaxational time scales can be significantly affected @xcite and this allows the possibility for impact ionization .",
    "ross and nozik @xcite have argued that an efficiency of approximately @xmath0 , much larger than shockley - queisser efficiency limit @xcite for photovoltaics , can be theoretically achieved using an unusual inversion , in which the chemical potential of the excited electronic band is below that of the ground band .",
    "other ideas to increase solar - cell efficiency by utilizing the possibility of carrier multiplication @xcite via impact ionization by removing and isetropically cooling the carriers through special membranes were proposed by wrfel@xcite .",
    "in this paper we discuss the photovoltaic effect for materials which are based on doped mott insulators , as opposed to the familiar semiconductors which are band - insulators .",
    "a variety of transition metal oxides that are predicted to be conductors by band theory ( because they have an odd number of electrons per unit cell ) are , in fact , insulators .",
    "mott and peierls @xcite predicted that this anomaly can be explained by including interactions between electrons .",
    "today , this can be described within the simple hubbard model , as arising from the strong on - site coulomb interaction . in this case",
    "the half - filled band leads to an insulator ; the added holes or added extra electrons beyond half filling lead to conduction . in this case",
    "also we can imagine that we can form a p - n junction separating a region of hole - doped from a region of electron - doped mott insulator .",
    "there are recent reports @xcite where the photovoltaic effect is observed in a p - n heterojunction of a doped magnanite ( a doped mott - like insulator ) and doped strontium titanate ( a doped band insulator ) .",
    "in addition , there are reports of the photoelectric effect observed on heterojunctions of doped magnanites and doped silicon @xcite and on a heterostructure @xcite of @xmath1 on nb doped @xmath2 . here",
    ", we demonstrate that in the case of _ narrow - gap _ mott insulators the photovoltaic effect can lead to solar cells of high quantum efficiency , where a single solar photon can produce multiple electron - hole pairs .",
    "in the simplest model of a mott insulator , a single conduction band is formed from one localized orbital ( which is , in general , a linear combination of atomic orbitals ) per unit cell ( or site ) . in the case of half - filling ,",

    "if we assert that the @xmath10 term is the unperturbed part and we treat @xmath11 as a perturbation , the eigenvalues of the unperturbed part are equally spaced by an energy @xmath3 . for the case of half - filling ,",
    "i.e. , in an @xmath12-site system with @xmath12 electrons , each energy level corresponds to a massive number of states forming subspaces @xmath13 characterized by the same eigenvalue @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of pairs of do - holes ( do - h ) .",
    "[ fig1](a),(b ) and ( c ) illustrate examples of states @xmath16 and 2 pairs of do - h .",
    "the subspaces @xmath13 are spanned by the states obtained by all allowed spin rearrangements . in a mott insulator ,",
    "the coulomb energy cost for two electrons to occupy the same orbital leads to an insulating state at half - filling . replacing some atoms in the lattice with different atoms , which act as donors or acceptors of additional electrons beyond half - filling thereby creating do sites ( n - type doping ) or holes ( p - type doping ) , leads to a conducting state with an effective carrier density given , respectively , by the density of do or hole sites . in a doped system ,",
    "i.e. , an @xmath12-site system with @xmath17 or @xmath18 electrons , the subspaces @xmath19 or @xmath20 are spanned by @xmath21 do or holes and @xmath15 do - h pairs .",

    "we have carried out the same calculation for 3d and the conclusions are qualitatively similar to the 2d case .",

    "[ fig2 ] based on an interface between two narrow - gap mott insulators , one of which is p - doped ( left side of the interface ) and the other which is n - doped ( right side ) . because of the energy gain that is achieved when a hole of the p - doped material is filled by an electron from a do site on the n - doped part , diffusion of electrons from the n - doped side will occur and this leads to a positively charged layer in the n - doped side adjacent to the interface and , vice versa , a negatively - charged layer in the p - doped side .",
    "the potential energy difference acts as a unidirectional collector of the do and holes created upon the incident light .",
    "let us , first , consider a narrow - band narrow - gap mott insulator .",
    "an incident photon of energy several times the mott - gap @xmath25 has enough energy so that several electron - hole pairs could be created . in practice , since the range of the solar spectrum is from @xmath36 ev , we can consider a mott - insulator with a gap of the order of @xmath37 ev and a bandwidth in the same range .",
    "we need a narrow - gap mott insulator in order to increase the efficiency , but on the other hand the gap should be large enough to avoid decay of the excited quasiparticles ( by phonon emission , spin - wave emission or through other possible excitations ) .    if the energy @xmath38 of the solar photon is between @xmath39 , the incident photon can create a single electron - hole pair by promoting an electron to the first mott - hubbard band .",
    "[ fig3](a ) indicates a two - step process in which the incident photon can create a state with two pairs of do - h , if its energy is higher than @xmath40 . in fig .",

    "[ fig3](b ) illustrates the same process in momentum space",

    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "this electron can decay quickly into two quasiparticles plus one quasihole state of the mott band , provided that the energy of the initial and final state match .",
    "this is caused by the matrix element @xmath44 of the coulomb interaction which couples the state @xmath45 , where the electron was initially excited by the incident high - energy photon , and the states @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which form the mott band @xmath49 .",
    "now , we would like to estimate the transition rate @xmath50 for an electron or hole of momentum @xmath51 from a high - energy band to undergo the decay processes illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",

    "[ fig3](b ) illustrates the following two processes : ( a ) the initially photo - excited particle can decay into two - quasiparticles plus one - quasihole given as @xmath52 ( second term in fig .",

    "namely , when the mott electron absorbs most of the photon energy and it is excited to a high - energy band , it becomes possible for the electron to decay into two dos and one hole in the mott band .",
    "when the created hole absorbs most of the photon energy , i.e. , it corresponds to an excitation of an electron from an inner valence state to the mott conduction band , it becomes possible for the hole to decay into two holes from the mott band and one do state from the mott band .",
    "each case can be approximated by the calculation of the decay rate of the high - energy electron or the decay rate of the high - energy hole because the other particle ( the hole or electron respectively ) , in this order in perturbation theory , behaves only as a spectator .",

    "nevertheless , the above estimate indicates that this process can be significantly faster than the decay processes through phonon @xcite or spin - wave excitations which are expected to be of the order of @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , the mott - hubbard gap and @xmath26 can be tuned to be several times smaller than the range of the energy of solar photons and , thus , a photon has the energy required to create more than one quasi - electron - hole pairs .",
    "now , let us consider the case of a narrow - gap but a wide - band mott - insulator , i.e. , the case where @xmath90 .",

    "impact ionization increases the number of charge carriers per absorbed phonon .",
    "however , auger recombination which is the inverse process should not be omitted .",
    "first , let us begin our discussion from the open - circuit situation .",
    "we found that for the type of mott insulators discussed in the previous section , the characteristic time scale for thermalization of the photo - excited electrons and holes is much shorter than the time needed for phonons to thermalize the electronic system with the lattice .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the photo - created dos and the holes in a mott insulator thermalize among themselves at a temperature @xmath102 higher than the lattice temperature @xmath103 , by means of the electron - electron interaction ( the interaction @xmath65 defined in the previous section in the case of narrow - band or the hubbard on - site @xmath3 in the case of a wide - band mott - insulator ) .",
    "this interaction between the electronic degrees of freedom leads to processes such as impact ionization and auger recombination , as well as carrier - carrier scattering .",
    "this equilibrium state is achieved as follows .",
    "the energy current of the absorbed solar photons is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the solid angle under which the sun is seen , and @xmath106 is the sun s surface temperature @xmath107 k. here , the lower energy cutoff is set by the value of the mott gap @xmath108 .",
    "first , there is the impact ionization process , and , then , the auger recombination process , i.e. , the inverse of the impact ionization process , shown as the reverse process of the one shown in fig .",
    "these two processes can be also denoted as follows @xmath109 where do@xmath110 is the initial do which creates the additional do - h pair in the mott - insulator denoted as do@xmath111 , h , by changing its energy - momentum state to become do@xmath112 .",
    "in addition , there is the analogous processes for high energy holes , i.e. , @xmath113 furthermore , there is the electron - electron scattering ( due to the matrix element @xmath65 defined in section  [ narrowband ] or the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 ) , which leads to do - do , hole - hole , and do - hole interaction processes : @xmath114 if these scattering processes are excluded , and we consider only impact ionization and auger recombination , then , only those processes involving dos and holes in certain energy and momentum range which allow for impact ionization and its inverse through energy - momentum conservation would take place and everything else would be excluded . as a result ,",
    "the final distribution of carriers would depend on energy and momentum and , thus , it can not be described by a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "therefore , in the absence of electron - phonon interaction , the above scattering processes are important in order to establish a common temperature and a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "if we now consider the equilibrium of all of the above processes , we realize that they produce a distribution of do - h pairs in equilibrium with a distribution of photons over energy due to the emission process : @xmath115 in which a do and a hole ( h ) combine and a photon ( @xmath116 ) is emitted ( luminescence ) or the inverse where a photon produces a do - h pair in the mott insulator .",
    "this distribution of photons in equilibrium with a gas of quasiparticles consisted of dos and holes is analogous to the case of electrons and holes in a band - insulator which can be described @xcite by a thermal distribution of photons at a temperature @xmath102 and a chemical potential @xmath117 ( see refs .  ) .",
    "the value of @xmath102 is determined from the equation @xmath118 here @xmath119 is the solid angle of the emitter and it is @xmath120 for a planar emitter .",
    "this equation defines a temperature @xmath102 of the electronic system which is considered decoupled from the lattice and the phonons .",
    "a value of @xmath121 is expected for a system in which the particle number is not conserved as is the case for the do and holes in the equilibrium state of impact ionization and auger - recombination .",
    "assuming that the density of the do and of holes near the interface is not large , the above process produces an equilibrium fermi - distribution of do and holes at the above temperature @xmath122 with no separation of the quasi - fermi - energies , i.e , the chemical potential difference between do and holes @xmath123 is zero .",
    "now , equilibrium is achieved ( under open circuit conditions ) at the temperature @xmath102 which is higher than the lattice temperature @xmath103 . as shown in the previous sections ,",
    "the time scale for the mott insulator to reach equilibrium ( through impact ionization , auger recombination and electron - electron scattering ) is much shorter that the time scale required for such a system to reach thermal equilibrium with the lattice through the process @xmath124 where @xmath64 denotes a phonon .",
    "this is so because of the facts that i ) the time scale for the decay processes described by eqs .",
    "[ impact1 ] and  [ impact2 ] is much faster than the process of electron decay via phonons and ii ) the interaction matrix elements involved in the processes described by eq .",
    "[ electron - electron1 ] , [ electron - electron2],[electron - electron3 ] are much stronger than the electron - phonon interaction matrix elements leading to the processes [ phonon ] .",
    "these facts allow first equilibration of the electronic system to a temperature @xmath102 , which is different than @xmath103 by creating multiple do - h carriers per incident photon . this has been argued in refs .   to lead to a significant increase of the efficiency by means of carrier multiplication @xcite for a conventional solar cell . by treating the carriers in the mott - insulator as weakly interacting quasiparticles which obey fermi - dirac statistics , which may allow us to apply the same assumptions and approximations used by brendel et al.@xcite to calculate the efficiency of a conventional solar cell",
    ", we also find that the maximum efficiency is bounded from above by the maximum of the following function of the voltage @xmath65 and the mott gap @xmath25 @xmath125 in the above expression , apart from a multiplicative constant common in the numerator and denominator expressions which cancels out , @xmath126 corresponds to the generation current , @xmath127 to the recombination current and @xmath128 the total power carried by the sunlight ; @xmath129,m_0)$ ] is the number of do - h pairs corresponding to each photon in dynamic equilibrium , where @xmath130 $ ] stands for the integer part of @xmath131 and @xmath132 is a maximum allowed value of the carrier multiplication .",
    "furthermore , @xmath133 is the carrier charge and @xmath134 is the ratio of @xmath120 to the solid angle through which the sun is seen from the earth and the case @xmath135 corresponds to fully concentrated sunlight .",
    "if we follow werner et al.@xcite and brendel et al.@xcite and use a value of @xmath136 , we reproduce the same upper bounds for the solar - cell efficiencies as a function of @xmath25 as those reported in fig .  1 and fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the calculated values for these upper bounds for solar - cell efficiencies reach up to 85 % for fully concentrated sunlight and in the limit of vanishing value of @xmath25 when @xmath132 becomes very large .",
    "as argued by wrfel @xcite , however , since the phonons are excluded from the equilibration process , the do and holes through eq .",
    "[ equilibrium ] will reach an equilibrium temperature @xmath102 which should be higher than 300 k ; as a result of the fact that the equilibrium temperature of the electronic degrees of freedom is higher than 300 k assumed in the calculation of brendel el al.@xcite , the efficiency should be lower than the values calculated using @xmath137 k. as was argued in the previous sections , the electronic equilibration is achieved much faster than the equilibration with the lattice , and this is important for another reason , namely , it allows the application of an idea discussed by wrfel @xcite , which is summarized below , in order to improve the efficiency further .",
    "the photovoltaic cell can achieve maximum efficiency when there is a way to cool the gas of carriers to the lattice temperature @xmath103 via an isentropic process @xcite where the relatively high energy of the carriers is not dissipated by heating the lattice but rather by creating electrical energy .",
    "following wrfel @xcite we assume that ( a ) impact ionization ( and auger recombination ) occurs at much higher rate than photon absorption / emission , which as argued above is more likely in a mott - insulator based solar - cell and ( b ) the carriers are removed from the solar - cell through membrane leads which are attached to the solar - cell on each side @xcite and which can be semiconductors of n - type and p - type with narrow bands of band - width @xmath138 and large band - gaps .",
    "because of the assumption ( a ) discussed above , the equilibrium of the carriers is not disturbed by the withdrawal of electrons and holes when the circuit is short .",
    "now , the interaction with the slower acting phonons of the membranes can not be avoided ; in this case , however , this interaction is utilized in a favorable way .",
    "namely , the hot electrons and holes with energies @xmath139 and @xmath140 in a narrow interval @xmath138 and with temperature @xmath102 can be cooled to the temperature of the lead - membranes @xmath103 by keeping the entropy constant .",
    "this can occur due to the above mentioned assumption ( b ) where the carriers , whose concentration is constant , are transported via an approximately flat band , which prevents energy losses because the carriers keep approximately the same energy .",
    "this works as a carnot engine which produces work @xmath141 which appears as a difference of the quasi - fermi levels between the electron and hole carriers in the two membranes and is given by @xmath142 .",
    "the details of how this works as well as the calculation of the efficiency can be found in ref .  .",
    "this calculation leads to a maximum energy efficiency of 85 % also in the limit of a vanishing mott - gap and for maximum concentration of solar cell radiation .",
    "therefore , in this subsection , we conclude that the idea proposed by wrfel may be utilized in solar - cells based on mott - insulators .",
    "a significant reason why a narrow - band mott - insulator may be preferred over the wide - band case is that the threshold for impact ionization to occur for the latter case ( and in a wide - band semiconductor@xcite ) is approximately 3 times the mott - insulator gap .",
    "this is because energy and momentum are conserved together via the impact ionization ( or auger recombination ) and presence of a wide - band implies a strong dependence of the energy with momentum . on the other hand , a narrow - band mott insulator of the case discussed in sec .",
    "[ narrowband ] gives a much smaller energy threshold for impact ionization .",
    "finally , there is an important issue to address which is that in a mott insulator the carrier mobility might be low .",
    "however , the effective collection length , as well as the drift field of the minority carriers can be large in such a mott insulator , due to the following reasons .",
    "the main reason why a do diffuses from the n - doped region inside the p - region to fill a hole , is the large energy gain which will be resulted by the fact that the double occupancy in a mott insulator of the type considered here , costs several ev .",
    "these materials become mott insulators precisely because of this large on - site coulomb repulsion which prevents the electrons from hopping from one site to a nearest neighboring site and this leads to an insulator in the half - filled band case .",
    "therefore , this strong on - site coulomb repulsion between electrons produces high diffusivity because the do in the n - doped region move to the p - doped region to gain a large amount of energy by filling the hole and this may lead to a high drift voltage and large diffusion length regardless of the fact that the electron mobility might be low .",
    "what should be the nature of the absorption spectrum in the case of the mott insulator considered here in order for it to be a candidate for the basis of an efficient solar cell ?",
    "there are two cases as discussed in the paper for the case of a narrow gap mott insulator .",
    "a ) narrow mott - band materials . in this case in order for the effect considered in the present paper to be significant , we need other bands present , not necessarily of mott type .",
    "the incident solar photon may be absorbed by an electron from another such valence band or the mott conduction band and be promoted to a highly - excited band . if there are no issues related to selection rules , these electrons are expected to decay very quickly ( for the reasons discussed in the paper ) to produce one or multiple do - hole pairs from the mott band . therefore ,",
    "if the material is appropriately selected , a large fraction of the solar spectrum , could be absorbed leading to a much larger photo - current than in band - semiconductors . b ) in a wide - band mott insulator , almost the entire solar spectrum could be absorbed by the same single mott - band .",
    "as analyzed in the present paper , in this case the initially photo - excited single do - hole pair decays into two or more do - hole pairs by means of the on - site coulomb repulsion within a time - scale much shorter than other internal processes which dissipate the excess energy of the do or hole beyond the mott gap .    in conclusion , it was argued that a p - n heterojunction in which the illuminated side is a narrow - gap mott insulator , if fabricated , should be expected to behave as a high quantum efficiency solar cell .",
    "this can be achieved when the mott insulator s energy spectrum for multiple quasi - electron - hole pairs falls within the energy range of solar photons .",
    "we find that in such case , a relatively high - energy incident photon initially creates a high - energy electron - hole pair which quickly dissociates into multiple quasi - electron - hole pairs and this leads to an increased photo - current . as required for the device to work , it is estimated that this dissociation occurs in a time scale shorter than the time needed for the excited electron - hole pair to relax through the emission of phonons or other intrinsic excitations .",
    "this allows equilibration of the electronic degrees of freedom among themselves , with excitation of multiple do - h pairs for every absorbed photon , at a different temperature , on a time scale significantly shorter than the time required for the system to reach equilibrium with the lattice .",
    "this separation of time scales also allows the application of other previously proposed ideas to improve solar - cell efficiency by cooling the carriers isentropically to a lower temperature@xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss the photovoltaic effect at a p - n heterojunction , in which the illuminated side is a doped mott insulator , using the simplest description of a mott insulator within the hubbard model . we find that the internal quantum efficiency of such a device , if we choose an appropriate _ narrow - gap _ mott insulator , can be significantly enhanced due to impact ionization caused by the photoexcited `` hot '' electron - hole pairs . </S>",
