    "with the increasing popularity of technologies such as digital television , internet streaming video and video conferencing , video compression has became an essential component of broadcast and entertainment media . among various kinds of approaches , block - based motion estimation and compression",
    "are most widely accepted ones .",
    "the _ block - matching algorithm_(bma ) for _ motion estimation_(me ) has been adopted in many international standards for digital video compression , such as h.264 and mpeg 4@xcite . in the framework of video coding",
    ", the statistical redundancies can be categorized by either temporal or spatial . for the purpose of reducing the temporal redundancies among frames ,",
    "motion estimation was applied@xcite .",
    "block - based matching algorithms consider each frame in the video sequence formed by many nonoverlapping small regions , called the marcoblocks(mb ) which are often square - shaped and with fixed - size(@xmath0 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "let @xmath2 represents the @xmath3th mb and @xmath4 the number of blocks , and @xmath5 ; let @xmath6 be the entire frame and the partition into mbs should satisfy @xmath7 and @xmath8@xcite .",
    "given a mb @xmath2 in the anchor frame , the motion estimation problem is to determine a corresponding matching mb @xmath9 in the target frame such that the matching error between these two blocks is minimized .",
    "then , a motion vector is computed by subtracting the coordinates of the mb in the anchor frame from that of the matching mb in the target frame . instead of sending the entire frame pixel - by - pixel , a set of motion vectors",
    "is transmitted through the channel which greatly reduces the amount of transmission . in the decoder side",
    ", a motion compensated procedure is applied to reconstruct frames using the received motion vectors and the anchor frame . referred to many researches ,",
    "the motion estimation and encoding part consumes nearly @xmath10 percent of the total amount of computation in the whole video compression procedure thus making it an active research topic in the last two decades .",
    "there are many proposals of bmas in literature .",
    "the most basic one is the _ exhaustive search_(es ) , also known as full search which simply compares the given mb in the anchor frame with all candidate mbs in the target frame exhaustively within a predefined search region .",
    "previous research showed that es can obtain high matching accuracy but requires a very large amount of computation thus infeasible to implement in real - time video applications . to speed up the search , various fast algorithms for block matching which reduce the number of search candidates",
    "have been developed .",
    "well known examples are _",
    "2-d logarithmic search_(logs)@xcite , _ three step search_(tss)@xcite , _ four step search_(4ss)@xcite , _ diamond search_(ds)@xcite which is accepted in the mpeg-4 verification model and widely implemented in vlsi , and the recent proposed _ adaptive rood pattern search_(arps)@xcite which is almost two or three times faster than ds and even achieves higher _ peak signal - to - noise ratio_(psnr ) than that using ds .    from the optimization point of view",
    ", block - based methods can be described by the following minimization@xcite , @xmath11 :    @xmath12 - i_{k-1}[\\mathbf{n}+\\mathbf{d}_{m}])\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the target frame ; @xmath14 is the anchor frame ; @xmath15 is the matching error ; @xmath16 are the motion vectors and @xmath17 is the search area to which @xmath18 belongs , defined as @xmath19 .",
    "sign of @xmath20 is positive when motion of the block is towards positive direction from @xmath21th frame to @xmath22th frame . and negative when motion of the blcok is in negative direction from @xmath21th frame to @xmath22th frame .",
    "@xmath23 is an @xmath24 size mb with the top - left corner coordinate at @xmath25 .",
    "the goal is to find the best displacement motion vector @xmath26 for each mb @xmath23 , in the sense of the criterion @xmath27 .",
    "_ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) was originally proposed by kennedy and eberhart in 1995@xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted and focused by researchers due to its profound intelligence background and simple algorithm structure .",
    "currently , pso has been implemented in a wide range of research areas such as functional optimization , pattern recognition , neural network training , fuzzy system control etc . and obtained significant success . like _",
    "genetic algorithm_(ga ) , pso is also an evolutionary algorithm based on swarm intelligence .",
    "but , on the other side , unlike ga , pso has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation@xcite . in pso ,",
    "the potential solutions , called particles , fly through the solution space by following the current optimum particles . the original intent was to graphically simulate the graceful but unpredictable choreography of a bird flock . through competitions and cooperations ,",
    "particles follow the optimum points in the solution space to optimize the problem .",
    "many proposals indicate that pso is relatively more capable for global exploration and converges more quickly than many other heuristic algorithms@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the pso algorithm and we propose the pso - zmp block - matching algorithm for motion estimation in section iii .",
    "simulation results and analysis on five video sequences are given in section iv .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "particle swarm algorithm is a kind of evolutionary algorithm based on swarm intelligence .",
    "each potential solution is considered as one particle , and these particles are distributed stochastically in the high - dimensional solution space in the initialization period of the algorithm . through following the optimum discovered by itself and the entire group , each particle periodically updates its own velocity and position .",
    "@xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where , @xmath31 is the number of particles and @xmath32 is the dimensionality ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 $ ] is the velocity vector of particle @xmath35 which decides the particle s displacement in each iteration .",
    "similarly , @xmath36 , @xmath37 $ ] is the position vector of particle @xmath35 which is a potential solution in the solution space .",
    "the quality of the solution is measured by a fitness function ; @xmath38 is the inertia weight which decreases linearly during a run ; @xmath39 are both positive constants , called the acceleration factors which are generally set to 2.0 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two independent random number distributed uniformly over the range @xmath42 $ ] ; and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the best solutions discovered so far by the group and itself respectively .    in the @xmath45 time iteration , particle @xmath35 uses @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the heuristic information to updates its own velocity and position .",
    "the first term in eq.[vid.original ] represents the diversification , while the second and third intensification .",
    "the second and third terms should be understood as the trustworthiness towards itself and the entire social system respectively .",
    "therefore , a balance between the diversification and intensification is achieved based on which the optimization progress is possible .",
    "in this paper , an algorithm based on _ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) and _ zero - motion prejudgment_(zmp ) is proposed to reduce the computation and obtain satisfied compensated video quality .",
    "the pso - zmp algorithm consists of three sequential routines .",
    "1)zero - motion prejudgment ; 2)predictive image coding ; 3)pso matching . instead of distributed stochastically in the entire matching space",
    ", we also devise a novel distribution pattern for particle initialization to bear the center - biased characteristics of common motion fields .",
    "as widely adopted , we measure the amount of computation and the quality of compensated video sequence by _ computation _ and _ peak signal - to - noise ratio_(psnr ) .",
    "computation is defined as the average number of the error function evaluations per mv generation . due to the minimum computational cost",
    ", we choose _ summed absolute difference_(sad ) as the error function which is defined as follows :    @xmath46    where the size of a mb is @xmath24 .",
    "+ the motion estimate quality between the original @xmath47 and the compensated video sequences @xmath48 is measured in psnr which is defined as :    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the number of frames in the video sequence .",
    "zero - motion prejudgment(zmp ) was firstly introduced in @xcite .",
    "data shown in @xcite represented that in most of test sequences , more than 70% of the mbs are static which do not need the remaining search .",
    "so , significant reduction of computation is possible if we perform the zmp procedure before the follow - up predictive coding and pso matching routine .",
    "we first calculate the matching error(sad in this paper ) between the mb in the anchor frame and the mb at the same location in the target frame and then compare it to a predetermined threshold , saying @xmath52 .",
    "if the matching error is smaller than @xmath52 , we consider this mb static which do not need any further motion estimation , and return a @xmath53 $ ] as its motion vector(mv ) .      based on the center - biased characteristics in video sequences , that is ,",
    "certain mbs are highly correlated in local regions of the frame , the encoder creates a prediction of a region of the current frame based on previously encoded and transmitted frames .",
    "if the frame is processed in raster order , the current - encoded mb should have four patterns of _ region of support_(ros ) that consists of the neighboring blocks whose mvs will be used to compute the predicted mv for prediction in fig .",
    "[ pre.pattern ] due to the limited computational cost . experiment mentioned in @xcite shows there is little psnr difference using these four ros patterns in the predictive coding routine , and ros type d consumes least amount of computation because of its simplest structure .",
    "thus , ros pattern d is adopted in this paper .      due to the spatial correlation characteristics between mbs in one frame , during the initiation period of the pso matching routine , we distribute the particles in four specific patterns(fig .  [ pattern.all ] ) with a view to reduce the computational cost but to achieve higher psnr .",
    "since frames are processed in raster order , the mb in the top - left corner in the frame , can not be predictive coded because there is no reference mb for prediction in the current - encoded frame .",
    "thus , for this condition , we simply skip the predictive coding and begin pso searching routine directly with the initial positions of particles in the pattern type b in fig .",
    "[ pattern.all ] .    for those mbs located at the leftmost column of frames ,",
    "their reference mbs used in predictive coding are in the other side of the frame , thus may not be highly correlated and inefficient in prediction .",
    "so , we also solely perform the pso searching routine in this case , with the pattern type d in fig .",
    "[ pattern.all ] . and , for the last leftmost",
    "mb been processed in the frame , that is , the mb in the bottom - left corner , we use the pattern type c in fig .",
    "[ pattern.all ] instead .",
    "otherwise , pattern type a in fig .",
    "[ pattern.all ] is adopted .",
    "we put four particles in a rood shape with size zero(size refers to the distance between any vertex point and the center - point ) in the adjacent mbs and four particles in a rood shape with size one , and then rotate it by angle @xmath54 . with two rood shape in difference size",
    ", we try to balance the global exploration and local refined search in order for broader searching space as well as higher matching accuracy .",
    "moreover , we distribute particles equally in all directions(8 particles in 8 directions ) with a view to , in stochastic condition , find the matching mb in each direction with equal possibility .",
    "notably , if the position of a particle in the during initialization and a pso run is out of the boundary of the image frame , we simply put the particle in the position nearest to its intended position .",
    "generally , there are two widely adopted stopping criteria .",
    "fixed - iteration _ , that is , given a certain iteration time , saying @xmath31 , the search stops after @xmath31 times of iteration",
    ". the other is _ specified - threshold_. during a pso run , the most - fitted value found by the entire group @xmath55 , called the ",
    "_ best so far _ \" value will be updated by the particles . for minimization problems , we specify a very small threshold @xmath56 , and if the change of @xmath55 during @xmath57 times of iteration is smaller than the threshold , we consider the group best value very near to the global optimum , thus the matching procedure stops . due to the center - biased characteristics of real - world motion fields ,",
    "we adopt the fixed - iteration method in this paper for reducing the computational cost .",
    "we incorporate the zmp , the predictive coding and the pso matching routines together and propose a block - matching algorithm for motion estimation based on pso and zmp .",
    "the algorithm can be summarized in the pseudocode below : +",
    "we ve tested our pso - zmp algorithm on five test video sequences : akiyo , container , mother & daughter , news and silent within 100 image frames(except 90 frames in akiyo due to the limitation of the sequence length ) .",
    "pso matching is the core routine in our algorithm . in this paper , to balance between computational cost and compensated video quality , we adopt the standard pso with inertia weight@xcite which is widely considered as the defacto pso standard .",
    "we use the fixed - iteration stopping criterion with max 5 iterations .",
    "the max velocity is set to 5 .",
    "the inertia weight @xmath38 decreases linearly from 0.9 to 0.4 during a pso run and two acceleration factors @xmath58 , @xmath59 are set to 2.0 , as commonly did .",
    "* we divide a whole image frame into @xmath60 mbs in the simulation . *",
    "we select a zmp threshold @xmath52 for each test video sequence correspondingly based on data obtained in experiments .",
    "the parameters are shown in table  [ zmp.table ] .",
    "* we do not restrict the range of candidate matching mbs rigidly by a search window @xmath17 . instead , through the fixed - iteration and the setting of max velocity , particles search for the matching mb in an area more flexible and adaptable .    .zmp",

    "in this paper , we have proposed a fast block - based motion estimation algorithm based on _ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) with novel particle initiation patterns . applied successfully in many functional and combinatorial optimization problems",
    ", pso is proved to have a relevant stronger ability in global exploration .",
    "in addition , a _ zero - motion prejudgment_(zmp ) routine is incorporated into the pso bma to further reduce the computational cost of the algorithm .",
    "simulation results show that the pso - zmp bma proposed requires less amount of computation and achieves psnr in a acceptable degree of drop . while close and acceptable psnr performance compared to",
    "widely accepted arps and ds bma .",
