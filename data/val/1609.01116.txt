    "broadcasting has been subject of extensive study and plays an important role in the design of communication protocols in various kinds of networks , see surveys  @xcite . the critical point for high performance computing",
    "is to assure efficient broadcasting , where data transmission is often found as the bottleneck . here , the interconnection network is modeled as an undirected graph in which the vertices correspond to processors and the edges correspond to communication links between the processors . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to synchronous networks , where at each time step messages can be sent from vertices to all their neighbors in unit time .    in _ broadcasting",
    "_ , a single message located at one vertex has to be spread to all other vertices in the network .",
    "we study a more general variant , when several different messages are to be simultaneously transmitted from one source .",
    "this is motivated by a situation when large amount of data needs to be broadcasted in a network with bounded capacity of links . in this case data",
    "can be split into multiple messages and sent individually .",
    "similar concepts for secure distribution of messages based on independent spanning trees were studied in  @xcite .",
    "the problem of same - source multiple broadcasting was considered previously under several different models  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a communication model with restrictions that :    1 .",
    "different messages can not arrive in the same vertex at the same time .",
    "equivalently , each vertex can receive only one message in a unit time step ( _ 1-in port model _ ) .",
    "every received message can be sent to neighbors only in the next step ( _ no - buffer model _ ) .",
    "3 .   at every step",
    ", a message is sent only to vertices which have not received it yet ( _ non - repeating model _ ) .",
    "note that although we restrict the number of incoming messages at each vertex to at most one , we do not limit the number of outgoing messages .",
    "that is , each vertex can send his message to all his neighbors at the same time ( _ all - out port model _ ) .",
    "we assume that messages have unit length ; that is , each message ( and only one message ) can be sent through a link in a unit time step , and we further assume a so called _ full - duplex _",
    "mode , in which two adjacent vertices can exchange their messages through their link at the same time .",
    "the condition ( a ) ensures that the load on vertices is minimized .",
    "furthermore , it is useful for security reasons to avoid two messages meeting at a vertex at the same time , if untrustworthy vertex is able to decode secret information from having access to more messages at the same time .",
    "similarly , an algorithm for secure message distribution with even more restricted condition when different messages can arrive in the same vertex only via distinct paths is proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the condition ( b ) can be useful for example in streaming context when every message needs to be sent immediately without delay .",
    "this is known as memoryless or queueless communication @xcite .",
    "the condition ( c ) ensures that ( b ) can not be circumvented by sending message to a neighbor and then back .",
    "it also helps to prevent unnecessary network congestion and message delays .    under the given model",
    "the following question arises : `` what is the minimal overall time needed for simultaneous broadcasting ? ''",
    "another questions are : `` what is the maximal number of messages that can be simultaneously broadcasted ? '' , and `` is it always possible to broadcast them in the optimal time ? '' throughout the paper , _ optimal time _ means meeting the lower bound given by eccentricity of the source vertex ( see observation  [ obs : c2 ] ) .",
    "these questions were already studied .",
    "the time optimality for same - source simultaneous broadcasting were the subject of study in @xcite , while the maximum number of messages that can be simultaneously broadcasted via hamiltonian cycles from a single vertex were studied in @xcite .",
    "let us remark that without restricting the number of messages that each vertex can receive at a time , a vertex may receive enormous amount of data altogether from its neighbors , which can cause a delay  @xcite .",
    "the study of efficiency of the 1-in port models can be found in  @xcite .",
    "simultaneous broadcasting in the case when also the number of outgoing messages is limited to one ( _ 1-out port model _ ) has been considered previously in @xcite .",
    "observe that in the 1-out port non - repeating model each broadcasted message traverses a hamiltonian path  @xcite .    in the paper  @xcite we developed a concept of level - disjoint partitions to study how many messages and in what time",
    "can be simultaneously broadcasted under considered model from a given source vertex in a given graph . in this paper",
    "we show that the problem of simultaneous broadcasting in a graph @xmath6 can be solved locally on a suitable subgraph @xmath7 of @xmath6 and then extended to a solution for the whole graph @xmath6 ( lemma  [ lem : ldpdk ] ) .",
    "we provide a structural characterization of graphs that admit simultaneous broadcasting of two messages from a given vertex ( theorem  [ thm : k=2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we provide a necessary condition in terms of girth and eccentricity of the root for existence of @xmath0 same - rooted level - disjoint partitions of optimal height ( proposition  [ prop : cond1&2 ] ) .",
    "we use the following concept to capture the information dissemination in graphs according to our setting which was originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "a _ level partition _ of a graph @xmath6 is a partition @xmath8 of @xmath9 into a tuple of sets , called _ levels _ , such that @xmath10 for every @xmath11 ; that is , every vertex has a neighbor from previous level .",
    "the number @xmath12 is called the _ height _ of @xmath13 , see an example in figure  [ fig : ldps](a )",
    ".     rooted in a vertex @xmath1 .",
    "a ) a level partition @xmath14 .",
    "b ) a level partition @xmath15 .",
    "c ) @xmath16 of each vertex @xmath17 . ]",
    "this definition is motivated as follows .",
    "starting at all vertices from the level @xmath18 , at each step the same message is sent from all vertices of the current level to all vertices in the next level through edges of the graph .",
    "thus @xmath19 is the number of steps needed to visit all vertices .",
    "note that we abstract from which particular edges are used but the condition admits to choose edges so that each vertex ( except the starting vertices ) is informed by precisely one neighbor from a previous level ( 1-in port model ) . in this way , a message does not wait at vertices before it is sent further ( no - buffer model ) , and since @xmath13 is a partition of @xmath9 , no message returns to a previously visited vertex ( non - repeating model ) .    note that for the sake of generality we allow the same message to start at more than one vertex . in a particular case",
    "when the starting level @xmath18 is a singleton , say @xmath20 , we say that the level partition is _ rooted _ at @xmath1 ( or @xmath1-_rooted _ ) and the vertex @xmath1 is called the _ root _ of @xmath13 .",
    "rooted level partitions can be obtained , for example , from rooted spanning trees by taking the set of vertices at distance @xmath21 from the root @xmath1 in the spanning tree as the @xmath21-th level of the partition .",
    "we are interested in a scenario when more messages should be broadcasted simultaneously with the requirement that they never arrive to the same vertex at the same time .",
    "this motivates the following definitions .",
    "two level partitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are said to be _ level - disjoint _ if @xmath24 for every @xmath25 .",
    "see an example on figure  [ fig : ldps](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "note that we allow @xmath26 since we consider also the case when different messages have the same source ( or overlapping sources ) .",
    "level partitions @xmath27 are said to be ( mutually ) level - disjoint if each two partitions are level - disjoint .",
    "then we say that @xmath27 are _ level - disjoint partitions _ , shortly _",
    "ldps_. if every partition is rooted in the same vertex @xmath1 and they are level - disjoint ( up to the starting level @xmath28 ) , we say that @xmath27 are _ level - disjoint partitions with the same root @xmath1 _ , shortly _ @xmath1-rooted ldps_.",
    "let @xmath27 be level partitions of @xmath6 , not necessarily level - disjoint .",
    "the set of levels in which a given vertex @xmath17 occurs is denoted by @xmath29 ; that is , @xmath30 we omit level partitions from the index of @xmath29 if no ambiguity may arise . for an illustration see figure  [ fig : ldps](c )",
    "now , assume that @xmath27 have a common root @xmath1 . then clearly @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , they are level - disjoint if and only if @xmath32 for every vertex @xmath17 except the root @xmath1 . finally , observe that if @xmath6 is bipartite , then for every vertex @xmath17 all elements ( levels ) in @xmath33 have the same parity .",
    "more precisely , they are all even if @xmath17 and @xmath1 are from the same bipartite class ; otherwise they are all odd .",
    "the number of level - disjoint partitions determines how many messages can be broadcasted simultaneously while their maximal height determines the overall time of the broadcasting .",
    "hence a general aim is to construct for a given graph    * as many as possible ( mutually ) level - disjoint partitions ; and * with as small maximal height as possible .",
    "level - disjoint partitions of prescribed number are studied into the details in section  [ sec : number ] , while the optimality of their height in section  [ sec : height ] .    in this paper",
    "we consider only simple connected undirected graphs .",
    "let @xmath1 be a vertex of a graph @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the graph obtained by removing @xmath1 and all incident edges from @xmath6 .",
    "if a subgraph @xmath35 does not contain @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath36 the subgraph of @xmath6 obtained by adding @xmath1 and all incident edges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",

    "similarly , a _ cycle _ is a sequence @xmath47 of distinct vertices up to @xmath48 with edges between consecutive vertices .",
    "the length of @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "a _ girth _ of @xmath6 is the length of a shortest cycle in @xmath6 .",
    "eccentricity _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath51 , is the maximal distance from @xmath17 to all vertices .",
    "in simultaneous broadcasting one often needs to send out at the same time as many messages as possible without limitation on overall time for a such task . in our communication model",
    "this scenario leads to the following question .",

    "[ prop : c1c2 ] let @xmath54 be level - disjoint partitions of a graph @xmath6 with the same root @xmath1 . then , @xmath55    note that the number of level - disjoint partitions @xmath54 starting in @xmath1 is at most @xmath56 since @xmath57 and @xmath58 for every @xmath59 . hence holds .",
    "we are interested in cases when the above bound is tight .",
    "if equality holds in we say there is _ optimal number _ of ldps rooted in @xmath1 .",
