    "the narrowness of these lines , their strength with respect to the hydrogen lines and finally their relative fluxes were incompatible with recombination excitation , but could be understood in terms of fluorescence excitation by stellar uv continuum in the photon dominated region ( pdr ) , located behind the ionized region .    here , observations of the whole balmer series with the new spectrograph uves , installed at the nasmyth focus of vlt - ut2 , are presented for orion and other  regions .",

    "observations were secured during the night 2000 july 25th-26th , using the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) located at the nasmyth focus of kueyen , the second vlt unit telescope ( dodorico & kaper  @xcite ) .",
    "spectra from both the red and blue arms were registered simultaneously on two detectors , using the standard setting dic1  ( 390 + 564 ) .",
    "the approximate spectral ranges were 3290  -  4530  ( blue arm ) , and 4610  -  5620     and 5660  -  6660  ( red arm ) , encompassing the whole balmer series .",
    "the slits were 8  and 11  long for the blue and red arms respectively .",
    "the slit width was 1  on the sky . according to the staff of the vlt , the spectral resolution was @xmath0 ( full width at half maximum , fwhm ) , equivalent to @xmath1 .",
    "the present conclusions do not depend on the exact value of @xmath2 , which will be determined after reducing the calibration exposures .",
    "a total exposure time of one hour was devoted to each  region ( except for orion , sect .",
    "[ m42 ] ) , the observations being divided in short sub - exposures to prevent detector saturation at the  balmer lines .",
    "data reduction ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration ) was performed with the uves pipeline , using the available calibration database .",
    "1d spectra were box - extracted from the central third of the slits .",
    "the standard sky - subtraction algorithm , inappropriate for extended objects , was omitted .",
    "this extraction was judged robust enough for this preliminary study .",
    "subsequent data reduction will be performed over the whole slit length , using the calibration exposures obtained during the observing run .",
    "cosmics and bad pixels were cleaned where necessary .",
    "sub - exposures were averaged ( no shift was observed from one sub - exposure to the next ) and the lines were shifted to the same radial velocity . for a given object ,",
    "the peak fluxes of the different lines were assigned the same value in order to display the relative variations of the weak lines ( figures of sect .  [ results ] ) .",
    "shifts and normalizations were all based on gaussian fits to the emission lines .",
    "line detections reported here in the blue wings of the  lines are at least at the 5-@xmath3 confidence level . most of them are confirmed by the detection of lines at the same velocity for several principal quantum numbers @xmath4 .",
    "the area observed in orion was the same as the one observed previously ( paper  i ) .",
    "the slit , oriented north - south , was located 2.5  south of @xmath5  ori  c ( ) at coordinates @xmath605:35:16.7 , @xmath705:25:29 ( j2000 ) .",

    "deuterium lines are detected from  to .",
    "they are redshifted @xmath8  with respect to  ( the isotopic shift between  and  at rest is @xmath9 ) , in good agreement with the previous measurements ( paper  i ) .",

    "fwhm are from gaussian fits , after quadratic subtraction of the instrumental point - spread function .",
    "the fwhm of the  lines is @xmath10 , much less than that of the  recombination lines ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "widths similar to these were found for the lines detected in m  8 , m  16 , m  20 and dem  s  103 ( see below ) . from fig .",
    "[ m42_fig ] , it is apparent that  increases relative to  for increasing @xmath4 , at least up to .",
    "approximate relative fluxes are given in table  [ table_m42 ] . despite lower signal - to - noise ratio",

    "+    the new observations bring confirmatory evidence in favour of the identification of the deuterium balmer lines .",
    "they complement and add to the results presented in paper  i. the lines are seen with similar characteristics in the five  regions , using different telescopes ( cfht and vlt ) and different spectrographs ( gecko and uves ) .",
    "instrumental artifacts ( such as grating ghosts or in - order scattered light ) can be definitely ruled out .",
    "since the lines are seen for many members of the balmer series , they can only be  or blue - shifted  emission .",
    "emission may arise from h@xmath15 gas ( recombination ) or h@xmath16 gas ( fluorescence ) .",
    "high - velocity ionized structures will produce  recombination lines with properties like those already listed in the case of m  17 ( width , flux , counterparts ) , not observed in the other  regions described in sect .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "a high - velocity neutral structure can not be formally excluded for any one isolated object , but the probability that such a structure could exist and yet be detectable only in  is low .",
    "no evidence for the existence of such a structure could be found in the case of orion ( paper  i ) .",
    "considering the present data , it would be extraordinary if such a neutral component could be present in such a systematic manner in five different  regions , always at about the same velocity .    understandably , the  lines are narrow since they arise from a cold material with small thermal velocity .",
    "nonetheless , considering the prevalence of large velocity fields in  regions , it was not a priori obvious that these lines would appear so systematically narrow ( table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "the explanation partly lies in the fact that the entrance aperture of uves is relatively small and that observable  regions tend to be incomplete on one side , with the associated molecular cloud and pdr located behind the expanding h@xmath15 region .",
    "this is consistent with the tendency shown by the  lines to be redshifted with respect to the  lines ( table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "thus , in practice , a small line width ( at the expected wavelength ! ) turns out to be an important criterion to identify . on the other hand",
    ",  regions may exist with pdr s encompassing a large velocity range .",
    "a fundamental criterion for  identification remains the lack of counterparts in lines from ionized species .",
    "large variations of the line intensity ratio /  with @xmath4 constitute another useful criterion ( table  [ table_m42 ] ) , since fluorescence will generally not result in the same decrement as the one corresponding to recombination .    as a result of the present high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise observations ,",
    "the identification of deuterium balmer lines is now very safe .",
    "detection of deuterium balmer emission in five  regions is reported .",
    "these are first detections in four targets , including an extragalactic one .",
    "detection was made feasible thanks to the large collecting area of the 8.2 m vlt mirror and the high efficiency of uves .",
    "fluorescence is confirmed as the probable excitation mechanism of , recombination being excluded .",
    "spectroscopic criteria leading to virtually certain identification of  in any given  region are now clearly established .",
    "possible ways to determine d / h from  balmer lines were discussed in paper  i. one method requires a knowledge of the @xmath4 for which the line ratio /  starts decreasing .",
    "the detection of  up to d9 , and possibly d16 , in orion suggests this as a promising way of investigation .",
    "comparison of  to  fluorescence lines , present in the uves spectra and also produced in the pdr , may be another way to explore ."
