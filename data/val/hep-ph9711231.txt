    "etagammaffpic 0.8 cm in 1995 the cleo collaboration has presented their preliminary data on pseudoscalar meson - photon transition form factors ( see fig .  [ profig ] ) at large momentum transfer , @xmath11 , for the first time @xcite .",
    "since then these form factors attracted the interest of many theoreticians , and it can be said now that the cleo measurement has strongly stimulated the field of hard exclusive reactions .",
    "one of the exciting aspects of the @xmath12 form factor is that it possesses a well - established asymptotic behavior @xcite , namely @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the decay constant of the pion . at the upper end of the measured momentum transfer range the cleo data @xcite only deviate by about 15% from that limiting value .",
    "many theoretical papers are devoted to the explanation of that little difference .",
    "the perhaps most important outcome of these analyses , as far as they are based upon perturbative approaches ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , is the rather precise determination of the pion s light - cone wave function .",
    "it turns out that the pion s distribution amplitude , i.e.its wave function integrated over transverse momentum , is close to the asymptotic form .",
    "this result has far - reaching consequences for the explanation of many hard exclusive reactions in which pions participate ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "( 6,4 )    the situation is much more complicated for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition form factors than in the @xmath12 case . in general",
    "there are at least four independent wave functions associated with the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valence fock states , since one has to consider @xmath15-singlet ( octet ) admixtures to the @xmath16 mesons .",
    "moreover , on account of the @xmath17 anomaly , there is also the possibility of intrinsic charm and gluon admixtures .",
    "correspondingly numerous are the decay constants being related to the configuration space wave functions at the origin .",
    "a full - fledged analysis of the transition form factors , taking into account all these components of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons , is beyond feasibility .",
    "although the recent large momentum transfer data on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition form factors measured by cleo @xcite and l3 @xcite allow a more refined analysis of these processes than it was possible previously @xcite , additional phenomenological constraints as well as simplifying assumptions on the wave functions and the decay constants are still required .",
    "thus , for instance , we will use the two - photon decays of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons as a constraint .",
    "the chiral anomaly combined with the pcac hypothesis relates the decay constants to the decay widths for these two processes .",
    "another constraint is offered by the ratio @xmath18 of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 decay widths , since it can also be expressed in terms of the decay constants .    an obvious possibility to reduce the degrees of freedom in the analysis",
    "is the use of the conventional @xmath15 octet - singlet mixing scheme .",
    "leaving aside eventual charm and gluon components , only two independent wave functions remain thereby and , hence , only two decay constants .",
    "the relative strength of the singlet and octet components in the physical mesons is then controlled by the pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath19 .",
    "this mixing scheme has been used in previous analyses of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 transition form factors throughout @xcite . as it will turn out from our analysis of the new large momentum transfer form factor data @xcite , that mixing scheme is inadequate ; it leads to inconsistencies with results from chiral perturbation theory @xcite and is in conflict with @xmath18 .",
    "an ansatz , however , where the four relevant wave functions are assumed to have the same form but different values at the origin , i.e.  different decay constants , meets all requirements : it leads to very good results for the transition form factors , the decay widths for @xmath20 and for @xmath18 .",
    "the decay constants determined in this analysis are in good agreement with the recent results from chiral perturbation theory in which also the conventional octet - singlet mixing scheme is given up @xcite .",
    "another interesting problem that may be investigated within our approach , is the significance of intrinsic charm in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "recently a substantial charm component in the @xmath6 meson has been proposed in order to explain the large branching ratio of the decay @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition form factors at large @xmath11 are sensitive to intrinsic charm , our analysis may shed further light onto the issue of the intrinsic charm magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we present the proper expansion of pseudoscalar mesons in terms of parton fock states and discuss properties of the light - cone wave functions associated with the light - quark valence fock states ( sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we calculate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition form factors . we employ the modified hard scattering approach ( mhsa ) in which the form factors are described by convolutions of perturbatively calculable hard scattering amplitudes and non - perturbative light - cone wave functions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard approach ( shsa ) of brodsky and lepage @xcite , the transverse momenta of the partons and sudakov suppressions are also taken into account in the mhsa . in this section",
    "we also discuss how to include the intrinsic charm contribution to the form factors . in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] we present numerical results on the transition form factor obtained on the basis of the conventional octet - singlet mixing scheme .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that this mixing scheme seems to be inadequate . a more general mixing scheme with two mixing angles",
    "is discussed in sect .",
    "as it will turn out , this scheme leads to a very good description of the transition form factors . also several other phenomenological constraints are satisfied within this scheme .",

    "transverse momentum closer to the value of 370 mev that we use for the light - quark components , would even increase the magnitude of the charm contribution .",
    "the two - gluon components of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons play no direct role in the analysis of the transition form factors since their coupling to photons is suppressed by the strong coupling constant @xmath27 . moreover ,",

    "approximate @xmath15 symmetry tells us that the octet and the pion wave functions can not differ much from each other . due to the larger quark masses involved ,",
    "the octet distribution amplitude may , at the most , be slightly more midpoint - concentrated , i.e.   @xmath111 , than the pion one which is well described by the asymptotic form @xcite . the singlet wave function is not related to the pion one by symmetry . since the binding mechanisms of the quarks in the flavor octet and singlet channels are however similar , we expect the light - quark singlet wave function @xmath107 to be not too different from that of the pion . thus , a reasonable starting point of the analysis of transition form factors is the assumption @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( @xmath67 ; @xmath114 ) .",

[ anglediff ] this approximately valid relation leads to a difference @xmath150 of the mixing angles of about @xmath151 , larger but , in regard to the uncertainties in ( [ anglediff ] ) , not in conflict with the the fitted value of @xmath152 .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath129 decay widths can still be cast into the form ( [ naive ] ) , but the angle appearing there is now to be understood as the mixing angle of the non - perturbative gluon contribution which may  and should  differ from the angle @xmath147 defined in ( [ newmixrel ] ) . in @xcite this angle , and",

    "another analysis of @xmath161 decays @xcite yields the more moderate value of @xmath162  mev for @xmath160 .",
    "if @xmath160 is that large , the radiative decay @xmath7 may be dominated by a contribution where the @xmath163 pair runs from the @xmath131 to the @xmath6 meson instead of being annihilated . on that supposition the width of that process can be calculated along the same lines as that one for the @xmath164 decay .",
    "the ratio of the two decay widths reads = ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^3 [ algr ] in analogy to ( [ naive ] ) .",
    "@xmath165 represents the ratio of the @xmath131-@xmath6 and @xmath131-@xmath97 wave function overlaps . in @xcite @xmath165",

    "one then estimates @xmath166  mev in contradiction to the initial assumption . in regard to",
    "the large binding energy required for the @xmath167 component of the @xmath6 meson , a value of @xmath165 significantly less than unity seems not implausible .",
    "consequently , a value larger than 6  mev for @xmath160 can not really be excluded by means of ( [ algr ] ) .",
    "we are now going to estimate the size of the intrinsic charm .",
    "since the effect of the charm component of the @xmath5 meson is suppressed by the small singlet mixing angle ( @xmath168 , see ( [ newmixrel ] ) ) we can mainly concentrate ourselves on the @xmath1 transition form factor in the following discussion .",
    "the large charm quark mass effectuates a strong suppression of the charm contribution to the @xmath1 form factor at small values of @xmath11 ( see ( [ incharm ] ) ) ; the main effect of it shows up for , say , @xmath169  gev@xmath4 .",
    "the charm contribution therefore approaches its asymptotic behavior with a much slower rate than the light - quark contributions .",
    "this difference in the curvature is the crucial point that allows to disentangle the charm and the light - quark contributions . in order to determine the range of allowed @xmath160 values",

    "[ table1a ] fixed .",
    "@xmath171 is determined by means of ( [ newmixrel ] ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath170 changes the strength of the singlet part of the light - quark contributions , that is dominant in the , for these considerations , most important @xmath6 case , and thus makes space for a charm contribution .",
    "we could have freed @xmath115 instead of @xmath170 , but this procedure would have the disadvantage of eventually destroying the agreement of our results with chpt and the good description of the two - photon decay widths .",
    "the numerical analysis yields the following range of allowed values for @xmath160 -65mev f_^c 15 mev [ ccbound ] the corresponding changes of @xmath170 are moderate ( see fig .  [ figcc ] )    -.5 cm    and do not lead to implausible singlet distribution amplitudes . the results for the form factors obtained with the values @xmath172 and @xmath9  mev for @xmath160 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figcc ] .",
    "for comparison , results with @xmath173  mev are also shown in this figure .",
    "the latter two values , which require drastic changes of @xmath170 , lead to results for the @xmath1 transition form factor in clear conflict with the data above @xmath174  gev@xmath4 . more restrictive bounds on @xmath160 than ( [ ccbound ] ) require more form factor data above @xmath174  gev@xmath4 .",
    "we stress that the approximation ( [ incharm ] ) rather underestimates the effect of intrinsic charm ( see sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we comment on @xmath18 and emphasize that this quantity is not included in our fits ; it is only used as an accompanying test of the results . with the large range ( [ ccbound ] ) of allowed @xmath160 values the gluon dominance ,",
    "assumed up to now for the @xmath175 and @xmath176 decays , may not be true anymore , and , hence , the mentioned successful test is perhaps accidental . whether the @xmath177 decay can reliably be explained by intrinsic charm in the @xmath16 meson remains to be shown .",
    "the modified hard scattering approach is shown to provide a consistent description of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition form factors over a wide range of the momentum transfer @xmath52  gev@xmath178  gev@xmath4 , where experimental data is now available .",
    "it is to be emphasized that this result is not trivial at all : the rather strong deviations from the dimensional counting behavior ( @xmath179 ) at small momentum transfer appear as a consquence of the transverse momentum dependence and the sudakov suppressions included in the mhsa .",
    "we have included the two - photon decay widths of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons in the analysis in order to reduce the degrees of freedom in the analysis .",
    "the ratio @xmath18 of the @xmath180 and @xmath8 decay widths is merely used as an additional test .",
    "our analysis of the transition form factors allows us to extract interesting information on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 wave functions .",
    "our starting point is the assumption that , like the pion , the light - quark components of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons are described by the asymptotic form of the distribution amplitude and a gaussian transverse momentum dependence with a universal transverse size parameter , @xmath113 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the wave functions at the origin of the configuration space , or the corresponding decay constants , are considered as free parameters to be determined from the analysis .",
    "we found hints at an inadequacy of the conventional octet - singlet scheme used to describe the mixing and the @xmath15 symmetry breaking in the @xmath5-@xmath6 system .",
    "the fit yields values of the mixing angle and the octet decay constant which substantially deviate from the chpt values .",
    "moreover , the fitted set of parameters , quoted in tab .  [ table1 ] , does not pass the @xmath18 test .",
    "agreement with chpt can only be obtained at the expense of large deviations of the octet wave function from the pion one . with regard to the quality of @xmath15 symmetry",
    "this seems to be unrealistic .",
    "in contrast to the conventional octet - singlet mixing scheme , the more general two - angle mixing scheme @xcite meets all requirements : it provides a very good description of the transition form factors with the asymptotic form of the distribution amplitudes .",
    "the set of parameters & & _ 8 = -22.2^ , _ 1 -9.1^ , f_8=1.28 f _",
    ", f_1 1.20 f _ [ finalset ] is in reasonable agreement with the recent chpt results obtained within that new mixing scheme @xcite and reproduces the two - photon decay widths of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons as well as the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter set ( [ finalset ] ) implies the asymptotic behavior of the transition form factors @xmath181  mev and @xmath182  mev for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 cases , respectively .",
    "thus , numerically the @xmath0 and @xmath12 transition form factor have the same asymptotic values .",
    "finally , we have also investigated whether a large intrinsic charm component in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons is allowed by the transition form factor data . from our analysis",
