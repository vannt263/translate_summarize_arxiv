    "we conclude this section with a few comments .",
    "first , it should be noted that the very sharp resonances predicted by the scba and related work fertig99,narrowpeak are _ not _ what is observed experimentally . while the hole experiments yield peaks with a surprisingly large @xmath271 , they are many orders of magnitude smaller than what is predicted by eq .",
    "( z2exp ) .",
    "if such a very narrow resonance is the correct expectation for the pinned coulomb system , then there is presumably some dissipation mechanism that has not been identified .",
    "one can not help but notice , however , that the results of replicas+gvm method are far more similar to the experimental results than the scba by itself gives . and while the simulation reported in ref",
    ". suggests a very narrow resonance , it is possible that the simplified disorder model used there may give a different result than a generic disorder model ( although previous studies have suggested this should not be the case  @xcite . )",
    "secondly , it should be emphasized that the choice of @xmath301 in eq .",
    "( constraint ) really is very special .",
    "if @xmath301 is allowed to vary even by a very small amount from the solution of this equation , we have verified that the semiclassical approximation to the spe s [ eq .",
    "( [ semiclassical ] ) ] results in a very sharp resonance as expected from the scba .",
    "this demonstrates that the important difference between the method used in this paper and the scba is not really in the use of replicas or the gvm , but rather the introduction of the extra constraint .",
    "indeed , it was suggested by fogler and huse @xcite that if one can instead impose a condition @xmath240 \\sim \\omega^x$ ] with a large value of @xmath302 , then the @xmath271 of the resulting resonance is again extremely large ",
    "smaller than what is expected from the scba , but still orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in experiment .",
    "a third important point is that , although these considerations leave us with questions about the @xmath271 of the resonance , it seems likely the resonance frequency itself is well - represented by the calculations described in this work .",
    "this is because the pinning resonance is determined by collective pinning , which balances the lowest two energy scales  elastic and disorder interactions  to determine the restoring force for motion of the system as a whole .",
    "( again , we emphasize that even a very small adjustment of @xmath301 results in a narrow resonance",
    ". the resonance frequency does not need to change noticeably to dramatically increase @xmath271 . ) a resonance frequency determined by collective pinning is consistent with what was found in the simulation of ref . .    as we have seen , the gvm+replicas method , together with the @xmath301 constraint , yields results that generally compare favorably with experiment .",
    "other methods such as the scba yield much sharper resonances than are observed . nevertheless , it is possible that such sharp resonances are the correct response for the model we are analyzing , in which case the mechanism that leads to pinning peaks with @xmath303 in experiment remains unknown .",
    "we leave these questions for future research .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the pinning peak of the wigner and bubble crystals in landau level @xmath19 as a function of the filling factor .",
    "we used an elastic action obtained from the hartree - fock and time - dependent hartree - fock approximations and treated the disorder averaging using the replica trick and gaussian variational method .",
    "comparisons with recent microwave experiments in @xmath19 show that the predictions of our model for the dependence of the pinning frequency and width of the pinning peak with filling factor compare favorably with experiment . at the moment",
    ", however , our approach can not reproduce the pinning frequencies observed in some range of filling factor in @xmath19 where the wigner crystal and the @xmath22 bubble phases are believed to coexist .",
