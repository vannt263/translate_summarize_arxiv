    "two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) placed in a high magnetic field exhibit a wide variety of strongly correlated phases , which have been the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental investigations since the first observation of fractionally quantized hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "examples of such phases of matter are the laughlin states  @xcite , describing partial fillings @xmath2 of the lowest ( @xmath3 ) landau level ( ll ) , as well as their generalizations to other odd - denominator fillings in the framework of hierarchy  @xcite and composite fermion theory  @xcite . these phases are topologically ordered and possess quasiparticle excitations with fractional statistics . at half filling of the first excited , @xmath0 ll , an even more exotic paired state , the moore - read pfaffian  @xcite , might be realized , which possesses non - abelian excitations ",
    "the majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "besides the incompressible liquids , some fillings @xmath4 also lead to compressible phases without quantized conductance .",
    "this is the case with the simplest of all fractions ",
    "@xmath5 in @xmath3 ll  which is a fermi liquid of composite fermions  @xcite , that only supports an anomalous hall effect  @xcite .",
    "generically for any @xmath4 , apart from the incompressible liquids , the natural candidates are compressible phases that break translational symmetry , such as charge density waves ( cdws )  @xcite .",
    "those were in fact proposed to describe the ground state of 2des before fqhe was observed  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 is very small ( under @xmath6 ) , a correlated wigner crystal indeed becomes energetically superior to a laughlin - type state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath7 , several varieties of states with broken translational symmetry become energetically favorable .",
    "around half filling of @xmath1 ll , the ground state becomes a charge density wave in one spatial direction or a  stripe \"  @xcite ; away from half filling , two - dimesional crystalline order sets in , resulting in a  bubble \" phase  @xcite . some of these phases also occur in @xmath8 lls when the hard - core component of the effective interaction is significantly softer than coulomb  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the experiments have shown  @xcite that it is possible to have , at the same time , the quantization of resistance and anisotropic transport , suggesting a possible coexistence of an incompressible liquid with a compressible (  nematic \" ) phase  @xcite",
    ".    theoretical understanding of the fqhe was pioneered by laughlin s method of many - body trial wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "model wavefunctions can be formulated using the conformal field theory  @xcite , and conveniently evaluated in finite - size systems via exact diagonalization of the parent hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "in addition , excitation spectra containing quasiparticles / quasiholes above the ground state can be studied .",
    "such analytical and numerical studies are made much easier by exploiting symmetry and the corresponding quantum numbers to characterize the ground state and excitations . to this end",
    ", rotational symmetry has been very useful  @xcite ; ocassionally , periodic boundary conditions have also been used  @xcite .",
    "however , as it was recently pointed out  @xcite , rotational symmetry is not fundamental to the appearance of fqhe . in a theoretical treatment of the fqhe , it is important to distinguish several  metrics \" that naturally arise in the problem .",
    "the band mass tensor yields a metric that defines the shape of the ll orbitals .",
    "a second metric derives from the dielectric tensor of the semiconducting material , and defines the shape of the equipotential contours around an electron .",
    "rotational invariance means that these two metrics are congruent , however in a real sample they might be different from one another , thus lifting the rotational invariance .",
    "it turns out , however , that a given fqh state also possesses an intrinsic metric that is derived from the two types introduced above .",
    "fqh fluids can be described as condensates of composite bosons  @xcite , which are topological objects that explain the quantization of the hall conductance and the emergence of fractionally - charged quasiparticles . however ,",
    "apart from topology , composite bosons also have a geometrical degree of freedom  the intrinsic metric that controls their _",
    "shape_. in a rotationally invariant case , the intrinsic metric is equal to the metric in the hamiltonian ; more generally , as we explicitly demonstrate below , the shape of composite bosons can be defined even in systems without rotational invariance . the fluctuation of the intrinsic metric plays an important role for the geometrical field theory of the fqhe  @xcite , and determines the energetics of quasiparticles , collective modes etc .",
    "generalizations of the laughlin wavefunction to the broken - rotational - symmetry case have been proposed for liquid crystal and nematic hall phases  @xcite , and very recently laughlin and moore - read wavefunctions ( as well as their parent hamiltonians ) have been formulated for the anisotropic case  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studying the effect of anisotropy in fqhe is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "anisotropy probes the variations of the intrinsic metric of fqh fluids , a fundamental physical quantity that relates to the geometric description of fqhe .",
    "secondly , we explore the possible effects resulting from tuning the rotational - symmetry breaking by an external parameter .",
    "note that the rotational invariance is explicitly broken in real samples due to the presence of impurities , which are essential for the emergence of fqh plateaus .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to induce the breaking of rotational invariance by tilting the magnetic field  @xcite , or by using systems with anisotropic bands , e.g. many - valley semiconductors like alas or si in the presence of uniaxial stress .",
    "the former method is performed routinely and belongs to the most popular techniques for studying the fqhe ; the latter method is relevant to alas  @xcite and some new classes of materials where fqhe might be studied .",
    "we provide brief arguments how the tilting of the field can be mapped to an effective variation of the metric , and then focus on the second method .",

    "consider an electron moving in the plane with the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in the following , manifestly covariant form : @xmath10 here @xmath11 represents the dynamical momentum , and @xmath12 is the mass tensor parametrized by the anisotropy @xmath13 and the angle of the principal axis @xmath14 .",
    "the mass tensor is unimodular @xmath15 . in the isotropic case when @xmath12 is the unit matrix",

    "this degeneracy is resolved by a second pair of operators @xmath25 that commute with @xmath26 and depend on the _ guiding center _ coordinates of the electron , @xmath27 .",

    ", we take the principal axes of the mass tensor to be along the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions ( @xmath37 ) , with different masses along the two directions ( @xmath38 ) . via simple rescaling @xmath39 , and therefore introducing @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we can immediatealy write down the single particle orbitals for this case : @xmath42 notice that the probability density @xmath43 is no longer localized on a circle , but rather an ellipse for @xmath38 . therefore , on a single particle level , the effect of mass anisotropy is to stretch or squeeze the one - body orbitals along certain directions , possibly rotating the principal axis ( for @xmath44 ) .    as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_introduction ] , certain semiconductor materials are likely to have non - trivial metric defined by the anisotropy .",
    "alternatively , the effective mass tensor can be experimentally tuned by tilting the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "tilting is known to produce complicated effects because it induces the coupling between electronic subbands and ll mixing , and a detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere . however , with a normal confinement ( perpendicular to the hall surface ) given by a harmonic well , the hamiltonian with a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath45 and a non - zero in - plane magnetic field @xmath46 can be solved exactly , yielding two characteristic harmonic oscillator frequencies  @xcite : @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the harmonic frequency of the normal confinement .",

    "therefore , the effect of tilting on the lll single - particle levels can be captured by the variation of the mass tensor .    in order to study a finite , interacting system of @xmath56 electrons ,",
    "it is convenient to choose a compact surface to represent the 2des . as we emphasized in sec.[sec_introduction ] , the presence of mass anisotropy destroys rotational invariance , and one must use periodic boundary conditions  @xcite i.e. put the 2des on the surface of a torus . the unit cell can generally be chosen as a parallelogram with sides @xmath57 and @xmath58 whose area @xmath59 is quantized because of the magnetic translations algebra : @xmath60 .",

    "this tensor in general can be different from the one that parametrizes the cyclotron orbits ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , physical properties are determined only by the relative difference between the mass tensor and the dielectric tensor , and for simplicity we can set the latter to unity .",
    "in other words , we assume that coulomb interaction is isotropic in space , hence its fourier transform is @xmath76 ( to model finite - width effects , we use the softened form of @xmath77 , following the fang - howard prescription ) .",

    "the primed @xmath83-functions are to be taken @xmath84 , and the sum over @xmath85 extends over the reciprocal space ( the prime on the sum indicates that the diverging @xmath86 term is cancelled by the positive background charge ) .",

    "we only consider spin polarized electrons and neglect the so - called multicomponent degrees of freedom , which can be the usual spin or bilayer / valley degree of freedom .",
    "this means that the filling factors we refer to as @xmath90 correspond to @xmath91 in experiments , where integer @xmath65 denotes the additional degeneracy that comes from several  flavors \" of electrons .",

    "indeed , the system appears more stable in the vicinity of it where it can lower its ground state energy or increase the neutral gap . on either side of the isotropy point , however , the system remains in the laughlin universality class ; e.g. at @xmath169 and @xmath160 the maximum overlap with the laughlin state is @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively ( these overlaps , although modest compared to the standards of @xmath3 ll , can be adiabatically further increased by tuning the @xmath127 pseudopotential ) . note that the quoted maximum overlaps are achieved by the laughlin state with @xmath172 somewhat different from @xmath13 of the coulomb state , analogous to fig.[fig_optimize ] .",
    "the new aspect of fig.[fig_onethirdanisoll1w2.0 ] is the transition to a compressible state with cdw ordering for @xmath173 . in that region of parameter space , the system is very sensitive to changes in the boundary condition  the sharp degeneracies seen in rectangular geometry in fig.[fig_onethirdanisoll1w2.0 ] are not obvious in case of higher symmetry , square or hexagonal , unit cell . as an additional diagnostic tool for the compressible states , it is useful to consider a guiding - center structure factor , @xmath174 where the expression for the fourier components of the guiding - center density , @xmath175 , has been used . note that @xmath159 is normalized per flux quantum rather than ( conventional ) per particle  @xcite . in fig.[fig_s0qonethird](a ) we show the plot of @xmath159 evaluated for the state with @xmath158 in fig.[fig_onethirdanisoll1w2.0 ] .",
    "two sharp peaks in the response , similar to those previously identified in @xmath1 ll states  @xcite , are the hallmark of cdw order .",
    "they are to be contrasted with the smooth response in case of an anisotropic state in the laughlin universality class for @xmath160 , fig.[fig_s0qonethird](b ) .     electrons at @xmath176 with thickness @xmath157 , as a function of anisotropy @xmath13 .",
    "energies are plotted relative to the ground state at each @xmath13 , and the unit cell has a rectangular shape with aspect ratio @xmath156 . ]    as a second example in @xmath0 ll , we consider half filling where the moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite is believed to be realized in some regions of the phase diagram .",
    "this state has a non - abelian nature , which is reflected in the non - trivial ground state degeneracy  @xcite when subjected to periodic boundary conditions . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the eigenstates of any translationally - invariant interaction possess a twofold center - of - mass degeneracy  @xcite . on top of this",
    ", moore - read state has an additional threefold degeneracy .",
    "conventionally , the many - body brillouin zone is defined for @xmath177,@xmath178 and has a size @xmath179 ( @xmath180 being the gcd of @xmath56 and @xmath24 ) , which forces the degenerate groundstates to belong to a brillouin zone corner @xmath181 and centers of the sides , @xmath182 .",
    "it is also possible to define a  quartered \" brillouin zone such that the three degenerate states are all mapped to zero momentum  @xcite .",
    "the three @xmath70 sectors are equivalent for a hexagonal unit cell , however in an anisotropic system the degeneracy is always lifted .    in fig.[fig_10_20 ]",
    "we plot the spectrum of the coulomb interaction as a function of anisotropy ( states belonging to @xmath70 sectors where the moore - read state is realized , are indicated ) . as earlier , we assume finite width of @xmath155 in order to instate the pfaffian correlations  @xcite .",
    "note that our calculation only uses two - body ( coulomb ) interaction , therefore in each finite system the moore - read state will mix with its particle - hole conjugate pair , the anti - pfaffian  @xcite .",
    "the mixing between the two states can be controlled by including higher lls  @xcite . for @xmath183",
    ", we find a three - fold quasi - degenerate multiplet , suggesting the presence of moore - read state at the isotropy point and in the neighborhood of it . in finite systems , there is some splitting of the degeneracy that might be reduced upon tuning the @xmath184 pseudopotentials .",
    "also , upon tuning the anisotropy around @xmath138 , there are crossings within the multiplet of degenerate ground states without apparent closing of the gap .",
    "the region of the moore - read state is defined by sharp transitions towards crystal phases .",
    "these transitions are likely second order because they do not appear to involve any level crossing , but rather lifting of the degeneracy within a ground - state multiplet .",
    "we have presented a method to study the effects of anisotropy on fqh phases in finite - size systems .",
    "we found that the prominent fqh states ( as in the lowest landau level ) are robust to variations of anisotropy , due to the adjustment of the intrinsic metric describing the shape of their elementary droplets . as we demonstrated using the example of the laughlin @xmath92 state ,",
    "this metric is usually a compromise between the metric dictated by the cyclotron motion and the metric originating in the dielectic environment of the 2des . in this sense , it is unlike the non - interacting landau level problem , or the problem of weak localization  @xcite , where the anisotropy can be completely  gauged away \" ( i.e. removed ) by length rescaling .",
    "instead , it is more akin to the problem of shallow donors in many - valley semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "indeed , such compromise picture leads to a quantitatively accurate description of the variation of the critical density of the metal - insulator transition ( an intrinsically many - body phenomenon ) in three - dimensional doped many - balley semiconductors  @xcite , so one may wish to ascertain to what extent this can lead to quantitative predictions in the fqhe case . in higher lls , anisotropy induces quantum phase transitions , likely of second order , to compressible phases with broken symmetry .",
    "anisotropy is an important aspect of fqhe as it represents a mechanism that probes the intrinsic metric of incompressible fluids in the geometrical picture of the fqhe .",
    "in addition , because our calculations show the possibility of phase transitions in the @xmath185 landau levels as a function of mass anisotropy , it motivates experimental studies on systems with both moderate mass anisotropy ( e.g. alas and si , @xmath186 ) , as well as systems with large mass anisotropy ( e.g. ge , @xmath187 ) , where behavior may be different in the upper landau levels from the anisotropic gaas . in these systems , as in gaas , anisotropy could be furher tuned using tilted fields , thereby adding to the richness of the fqhe phenomena .",
