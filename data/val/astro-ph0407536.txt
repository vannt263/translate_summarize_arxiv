    "symbiotic stars are binary systems typically consisting of a red giant primary with a hot white dwarf companion orbiting close enough to the red giant that it can accrete material from the giant s wind .",
    "most symbiotic systems contain a normal red giant and these , based on their near - ir colours ( consistent with the presence of a stellar atmosphere with t@xmath4k ) are classified as s - type systems ( stellar ) .",
    "the remainder ( @xmath5% ) contain mira variables and their near - ir colours are consistent with the combination of a reddened mira and a warm dust shell : these are classified as d - type systems ( dusty ) .    in many symbiotic systems , there is little or no evidence of an accretion disk surrounding the hot , accreting component .",
    "in fact , there is no strong evidence of a disk in any s - type symbiotic containing a white dwarf .",
    "this also appears to be true for d - type symbiotics .",
    "there is also no evidence for a fuv contribution by a nebular continuum shortward of about 1600  .",
    "therefore the fuv continuum may be contributed virtually entirely by the hot accreting white dwarf radiation up to 1800  .",
    "the presence of a hot accreting white dwarf in symbiotic binaries offers the possibility of studying the effect of wind accretion on the compact star and to further test whether accretion disks surround the accreting compact component .",
    "this is especially important in view of the smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations of mastrodemos and morris ( 1998 ) which predict disk formation from wind accretion . in their 3d wind accretion models",
    ", they found that permanent accretion disks form in detached binaries with a variety of separations including those characteristic of the binary properties of symbiotic variables .",
    "their disks lead to significant accretion of mass and angular momentum by the mass - gaining component and some of the the disk properties conform to those expected from steady state disk theory ( mastrodemos and morris 1998 ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra of hot , high gravity stellar atmospheres and optically thick steady - state accretion disks offer the possibility of directly determining the properties of the hot component and further testing for the presence or absence of an accretion disk . _ up to now , there has been no direct comparison of the fuv spectra of the hot components of symbiotics with realistic models of hot white dwarf atmospheres and accretion disk models with vertical structure_. we have selected eg and as a followup to our study of the hot component in rw hydrae ( sion et al .",

    "the estimate for the giant radius of vogel et al .",
    "is distance independent .",

    "we constructed a grid of nlte photosphere models by using the nlte option in tlusty198 .",
    "we selected the spectra swp42347 and swp18773 for this comparison using the same masking of emission line regions as in the lte fit .",
    "for the nlte grid , we computed models for the following parameter ranges : t@xmath26/1000 from 40 to 90k in steps of 1000k , log @xmath37 from 6.0 to 8.5 in steps of 0.5 , and assumed solar composition for all models . based upon the lowest @xmath39 value ( 1.8214 ) , we found the best - fitting nlte model to swp42347 to have t@xmath40k with log @xmath41 with a scale factor @xmath42 .",
    "this nlte fit is displayed in figure 1 . for log @xmath43 ( a high gravity subdwarf )",

    "an archival fuse spectrum of eg and taken at phase 0.46 allows an additional , independent determination of temperature .",
    "we carried out nlte model photosphere and accretion disk analyses of this fuse spectrum , taking the same parameter range that we explored in the iue archival analysis .",
    "our modeling of the fuse data yielded , for a single temperature white dwarf , a best - fitting temperature t@xmath48k in excellent agreement with the iue temperature .    nevertheless , since the hot component is widely believed to have a low mass ( vogel et al .",
    "1992 ; muerset et al . 2000 ) , and the orbital inclination is known to be high , this offers the advantage of reducing the number of free parameters in our fitting by fixing the mass of the white dwarf at 0.4 msun with a radius of 0.04 rsun and the orbital inclination at 75 degrees , as given in table 1 from the refereed literature . for this mass , log g = 6.84 .",
    "we also fixed the distance at 676 pc , the distance given by the hipparcos parallax , and took the abundances to be solar and the rotational velocity to be 100 km / s .",
    "the masking and the binning of the fuse spectrum was the same as above .",
    "likewise , for the accretion disk model fits , we took m@xmath49 . and fixed the inclination at the published value of 75 degrees and fixed the distance at 676 pc .",
    "the best - fitting nlte white dwarf model yielded t@xmath48k with a reduced @xmath39 value = 4.032 and is displayed in figure 3 . once again",
    ", this value of t@xmath26 agrees with the temperature we derived from the iue spectra at superior spectroscopic conjunction when the white dwarf is in front of the red giant .",
    "the accretion disk models provide an interesting initial exploration of the source of fuv flux from the eg and hot component .",
    "therefore , we carried out fits to the three spectra at 0.5 phase , the iue spectra swp18773 and swp42637 and the fuse spectrum .",
    "once again , we fixed the white dwarf mass at @xmath3 , the inclination angle @xmath50 and adopted the distance of 676 pc given by the hipparcos parallax . by comparison , using the parameters from table 1 , we find the best - fitting optically thick accretion disk model to the fuse spectrum have @xmath1 m@xmath51/yr but the @xmath39 value = 31.45 . as shown in figure 4 , at an inclination of 75@xmath52 , the disk flux at @xmath53/yr is far too low to match the observed fuse flux level .",
    "at least an order of magnitude higher accretion rate would be required to reach the observed fuse flux level .",
    "an accretion rate as high as @xmath54/yr is implausible in view of the observed red giant mass loss rate ( see table 1 ) and the predicted accretion efficiency from 3d hydrodynamic simulations of wind accretion using symbiotic parameters .",

    "we have found that for the widely accepted parameters of eg and , i.e. , a low hot component mass of @xmath55 , a system inclination of 75 degrees and a distance of 676 pc parallax , the hot component has a temperature of 50,000k and is the principal source of the fuv continuum in the iue spectra and fuse spectrum taken at orbital phase 0.5 . on the other hand , accretion disk models at moderately high inclinations with accretion rates @xmath1 for white dwarf masses @xmath56 are grossly inconsistent with the distance from the hipparcos parallax .",
    "this is surprising since , on theoretical grounds , permanent , stable disks are predicted to form from red giant wind mass transfer to the white dwarf ( mastrodemos and morris 1998 ) .",
    "it is important to note however that in the mastrodemos and morris ( 1998 ) simulations , the effects of the radiation field of the hot component and any hot component magnetic field are neglected .",
    "moreover , our finding is consistent with other studies which rule out a disk independently based upon spectroscopic evidence .",
    "our study is the first to do so using actual optically thick disk models with vertical structure .",
    "the phases near phase 0.5 are far outside the range where rayleigh scattering would have an appreciable effect and attenuate the continuum .",
