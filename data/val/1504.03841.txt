    "on - chip electronic thermometry is an important part of modern research and commercial applications of nano - technology , and it has been studied already for several decades ; see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "many of these thermometers are based on tunnel junctions or quantum dots @xcite .",
    "temperature sensors based on normal ( n ) and superconducting ( s ) metal tunnel junctions are used in a wide range of experiments @xcite and applications @xcite .",
    "an example of such a device is a primary coulomb blockade thermometer ( cbt ) that is based on normal - metal tunnel junctions with an insulator @xmath0 as a tunnel barrier ( nin ) @xcite , where the electronic temperature can be obtained by measuring the smearing of the single - electron blockade .",
    "one more example is a sns thermometer @xcite , whose critical current @xmath1 depends strongly on the temperature .",
    "primary electronic thermometry has also been successfully demonstrated down to 10  mk using shot noise of a tunnel junction ( snt ) @xcite .",
    "nowadays , a standard dilution refrigerator reaches a temperature of 5 - 10  mk , with a record of 1.75  mk @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a thermometer that has a modest structure and a simple but accurate temperature reading at sub-10-mk temperatures and does not require a complicated experimental setup is still missing .",
    "for this purpose , we present a normal - metal - insulator - superconductor ( nis ) junction that is widely used both as a refrigerating element and a probe of the local electronic temperature in different experiments and applications @xcite .",
    "the possibility to use the nis junction at sub-10-mk temperatures makes this thermometer suited for cryogenic applications at low temperatures .",
    "for instance , quantum information is a highly focused and rapidly developing field in modern physics . for many realizations , such as superconducting and quantum - dot qubits",
    ", one needs to define a set of quantum states at low temperature , that are well separated and well controlled and insensitive to noise and decoherence effects @xcite .",
    "several experimental realizations of two - level systems @xcite suggest that decreasing temperature further will increase the coherence times as well as improve charge sensitivity .",
    "we think that our thermometer will be interesting for a community who is willing to discover new physics as well as improve already existing devices that require low temperatures for their proper functioning .",
    "the nis thermometer is easy to operate compared to snt @xcite , and its thermalization is quite straightforward compared to cbt @xcite due to the single - junction configuration and can be combined on chip with other solid - state devices .",
    "a measurement of the nis current - voltage ( @xmath2 ) characteristic yields a primary temperature reading .    in this paper , we study both experimentally and theoretically an on - chip electronic thermometer based on a single nis tunnel junction at sub-10-mk temperatures .",
    "we demonstrate the operation of the nis thermometer down to 7.3  mk .",
    "in addition , we develop a thermal model that explains our measurement data and shows that self - heating effects remain negligible for temperatures down to 1  mk .",

    ", the current is suppressed due to the superconducting gap , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "when biased at voltage @xmath4 , current depends on the temperature due to the broadening of the fermi distribution @xmath5 in the normal metal with the temperature @xmath6 and the boltzmann constant @xmath7 .",
