    "there exist two competitive approaches for precision charm- and bottom - quark mass determinations .",
    "the first approach involves solving qcd on the lattice ( lqcd ) .",
    "this is achieved by simulating the pseudoscalar correlator on the lattice and comparing it with the four - loop perturbative prediction.@xcite this approach yields for the charm and bottom quarks ( in the @xmath2-scheme ) @xmath3 the second approach is the method of qcd sum - rules , pioneered by the itep group.@xcite this approach takes as theoretical input the operator product expansion and experimental input the measured @xmath4 cross - section , where @xmath5 are either the charm or bottom quarks .",
    "an example of a recent determination@xcite of the charm and bottom masses along these lines obtained @xmath6 these masses are in remarkable agreement with the lqcd results .",
    "the philosophy for obtaining the above sum - rule results above was to to consider the hilbert - moment sum - rule @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vector correlator of two @xmath9-flavoured quark currents . the right - hand side can be calculated using the ope , whilst the left - hand side is evaluated using experimental data and pqcd .",
    "the quark mass , which enters @xmath8 , is determined by demanding that eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "the only freedom one has is to choose @xmath10 , which controls the weight function over which the data is to be integrated .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath10 is chosen on the basis of producing the lowest total uncertainty in the mass .",
    "+ however , the analyticity of the correlator @xmath8 allows one to write down more general sum - rules , for which eq .",
    "is only a special case .",
    "such sum - rules allow for a far greater choice of weight functions over which to integrate the data .",
    "such sum - rules were considered in our work ref . .",
    "the philosophy for choosing the weight function is then two - part : first , enumerate the uncertainties affecting our mass determination , and second , choose the weight function that minimizes the total uncertainty .",
    "thus the determination of the quark masses has been turned into a non - trivial optimization problem .",
    "such a procedure was indeed found to reduce the total uncertainties , finding as final results @xmath11 where we used identical error metrics as used by ref . , though using slightly lower uncertainties for some input parameters .",
    "these are the lowest uncertainties for any sum rule approach for the heavy quark masses , the lowest uncertainty for any method for the bottom quark mass .",
    "+   + the purpose of this work will be to give an introduction to this sum rule approach .",
    "we first consider the vector current correlator @xmath12|0\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\   & = & ( q_\\mu q_\\nu - q^2 g_{\\mu\\nu } ) \\pi_q(q^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",

    "as is well - known , causality implies the analyticity of the correlator @xmath8 in the entire complex plane , except for a branch cut along the positive real axis .",
    "the residue theorem in the complex @xmath17-plane thus implies @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is an arbitrary laurent polynomial . the left - hand side of eq .",
    "will be evaluated using experimental data , whilst we calculate the right - hand side by assuming that the exact correlator can be replaced by the ope prediction , @xmath20 .",
    "is our key expression , which generalizes some other sum - rules found in the literature .",
    "for example , if @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the contour integral in eq . vanishes and one obtains the hilbert moment sum rule eq . .",
    "if instead one takes @xmath19 to be some polynomial ( ie . only containing positive powers of @xmath17 ) , then the residue is zero in eq .",
    "and one obtains the finite energy sum rule used in ref . .",
    "+ @xmath24 can be parameterized as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dominant pqcd contribution , @xmath27 are non - perturbative contributions and @xmath28 are qed contributions .",
    "+ crucial to achieving high - precision using this approach is the availability of @xmath29 results for @xmath26 in both the high- and low - energy limits .",
    "the laurent - expansion of @xmath26 about @xmath30 has the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath9-quark electric charge ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",

    "their masses and widths are taken from the particle data group,@xcite whilst the effective electromagnetic couplings are taken from ref . .",
    "for the resonance threshold region , which we take to be the range @xmath69 , we use a combination of bes@xcite and cleo@xcite measurements of @xmath70 . in order to obtain @xmath71 to use in our sum - rule eq . , we subtracted the light contribution , @xmath72 , from @xmath73 .",
    "we use the pqcd prediction of @xmath72 .",
    "+   + the kernel @xmath19 is chosen on the basis that it minimizes the total uncertainty in the charm mass .",
    "the primary uncertainties come from the experimental data ( @xmath74 ) , the strong coupling ( @xmath75 ) , variation of the renormalization scale by @xmath76 about @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , and the gluon condensate ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "finally , we also want our method to insensitive to variations in our integration end - point @xmath66 .",
    "we check this by varying @xmath66 in the range @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "although higher powers of @xmath10 better suppress the low - precision continuum threshold data in favour of the higher - precision @xmath67 and @xmath68 resonance contributions , this comes at the expense of the convergence of the ope .",
    "the gluon condensate starts to contribute more , the mass becomes more sensitive on the value of the strong coupling , as well as on variations on @xmath37 .",

    "their masses and widths are taken from the particle data group,@xcite whilst the effective electromagnetic couplings are taken from ref . .",
    "finally , we employ the recent _ babar _ measurement of @xmath90 in the continuum threshold region between @xmath91 and @xmath92.@xcite as was pointed out in ref .",
    ", this data can not be directly be used in our sum - rule , as the initial state radiation and radiative tail of the @xmath89 resonance must be removed , as well as the vacuum polarization taken into account .",
    "the procedure detailed in ref .",
    "was followed to obtain the data entering our sum rule eq . .",
    "the data this data is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : bottomdata ] , with the pqcd prediction ( obtained using the fortran program rhad@xcite ) included . as can be seen",
    ", the pqcd prediction is larger than the highest - energy data point .",
    "there are three possibilities to account for this fact :    * _ option a _ : the _ babar _ data are correct , but pqcd is only valid at some higher energy , for example @xmath93 .",
    "use a linear interpolation between the last data point @xmath94 and @xmath95 , rather than the prediction from ` rhad ` .",
    "* _ option b _ : the pqcd prediction from ` rhad ` is correct , but the _ babar _ data are incorrect , and there is some unaccounted for systematic uncertainty . in this case , we multiply all the data by a factor of 1.21 to make the data consistent with pqcd . * _ option c _ : the _ babar _ data are correct , and pqcd starts at @xmath96 .",
    "however , the pqcd prediction of ` rhad ` is incorrect .",
    "the exact analytical form for @xmath97 ( rather than just expansions at low- and high - energies ) is only known at tree - level and one - loop level . at @xmath55 already , the full anayltic result has to be reconstructed using pad approximants to patch together information about @xmath98 obtained at @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "both the pad method , and the reliance on pqcd results obtained at threshold ( @xmath101 ) could introduce unaccounted systematic errors . as a measure of the methods dependence on the reconstructed correlator , we will replace the ` rhad ` prediction of @xmath97 with the high - energy expansion prediction eq .",
    ", which is closer to the experimental result for @xmath102 .",
    "the first two options were considered in ref . .",
    "_ option c _ is the least plausible of the options , but we include it for completeness .",
    "the kernel @xmath19 in eq .",
    "is chosen to minimize the dependence of the mass on _ options a , b , c _ , as well as reducing the dependence the uncertainties from the strong coupling , varying @xmath37 ( we vary @xmath37 in the range @xmath103\\,\\text{gev}$ ] ) and the experimental data . the optimal kernels were found to be linear combinations of three to four powers of @xmath17 in the set @xmath104 , that are determined by demanding that the kernel obeys a global constraint that reduces the contribution of the problematic energy regions .",
    "as an example , the order 3 laurent polynomial is of the form @xmath105 , and is determined by @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "this determines @xmath108 up to an irrelevant constant term . including lower - powers of @xmath17 in the set @xmath109 produces poor convergence of the pqcd expansion , whilst including higher - powers of @xmath17 brings in unknown @xmath29 terms in the high - energy expansion .",
    "the value of @xmath110 is chosen to coincide with the end of the _ babar _ data , @xmath111 .",
    "it is clear that this choice of kernel will reduce the dependence on _ option a _ and _ option c_. however , this kernel has the virtue of also diverging rapidly outside of the range @xmath112 $ ] , which leads to a suppression of the potentially problematic _ babar _",
    "continuum threshold data in favour of the mroe precisely known narrow upsilon resonances .",
    "this will reduce the dependence on _ option b_. +   + the results for some selected kernels , with a full uncertainty breakdown , are shown in table [ tab : bottom ] .",
    "as can be seen , our new approach gives very similar uncertainties to the popular kernels @xmath113 and @xmath114 when only considering the usual uncertainty metrics ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , our method is far less sensitive to _ options a , b , c_. in particular , the work ref . obtained their final result using the kernel @xmath113 , which is clearly highly sensitive to _ options a , b , c_. +   + there are @xmath116 possible kernels in the class @xmath117 and @xmath118 different kernels in the class @xmath119 .",
    "each of these kernels put very different emphasis on the low- and high - energy pqcd expansions , and leads to significantly different sensitivities to _ options a , b , c_. the range of mass values obtained using all 10 kernels in the class @xmath117 is plotted for varying @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottomstab ] .",
    "as can be seen , all of the values of the mass lie in the range @xmath120 for a range of @xmath121 . using instead the 5 kernels in the class @xmath122 over a range of @xmath123",
    ", we obtain a mass range of @xmath120 , exactly the same as using the class @xmath119 .",
    "this consistency of our mass result with using very different kernels over a very large range of @xmath66 inspires great confidence in this method .",
    "we give as our final result @xmath124 the total uncertainty is the uncertainty from varying @xmath37 , the strong coupling , and experiment all added in quadrature . if we include the uncertainties from _ options a , b , c _ , the uncertainty in our result increases only marginally to @xmath125 .",
    "this is in contrast to using the kernel @xmath113 , whose uncertainty in the mass would more than double when including the _ options a , b , c _ uncertainty .     using kernels of the form @xmath117 for varying @xmath66 . ]",
    "we introduced a new sum - rule eq . , which allows us to employ both positive and inverse moments for the weight function @xmath19 over which the experimental data is integrated .",
    "the results @xmath126 were obtained using the kernels @xmath65 for the charm case and @xmath127 in the bottom case .",
    "when our uncertainty metrics are from experiment , the strong coupling , variations in @xmath37 and from the gluon condensate , then these new kernels produce only modest uncertainty reductions in comparison to kernels of the form @xmath21 .",
    "however , these new kernels truly excel when other systematic uncertainties need to be controlled .",
