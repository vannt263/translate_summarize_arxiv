    "quarks produced in high energy processes materialize by evolving into jets of hadrons . the particular hadronic fragments and their kinematic dependences are of considerable interest .",
    "this fragmentation process reveals the features of the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the inclusive process of quark fragmentation into a single observed hadron along with any number of unobserved accompanying particles is described by a set of fragmentation functions .",
    "these fragmentation functions , defined in terms of appropriate light cone variables , kinematic variables and invariants , are probability distributions .",
    "these functions have received considerable attention in recent years .",
    "while experimental information beyond the pion distribution ( presumably from light quarks ) has been slow in accumulating , theoretical interest has been growing .",
    "the particular functional form for heavy flavored quarks to fragment into heavy flavored hadrons is of special interest .",
    "experimentally it is possible to identify heavy flavored jets by the production and characteristic flavor changing weak decays of the hadrons .",
    "theoretically this situation has been studied using operator product expansion techniques , light cone quantization , qcd perturbation theory , and heavy quark effective theory , among other methods .",
    "some of these methods yield general properties that reflect the overall structure of qcd , as it is currently understood .",
    "other approaches take particular models of the low energy behavior expected from qcd , but in regions that are not perturbatively calculable .",
    "the particulars of the various approaches are near the point of being tested against experiment .",
    "one general feature is known - the peak of the hadron distribution moves toward higher momenta as the quark mass increases . this feature is a result of the kinematics implicit in most models of the non - perturbative process , and is incorporated in the phenomenological peterson function  @xcite that is used by experimenters to fit the sparse data on heavy quark fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to test the spin dependences of the fragmentation processes experimentally .",
    "yet these dependences are very important to know .",
    "they reflect the details of the primarily non - perturbative mechanism by which parton polarization is passed on to the hadrons .",
    "the spin - dependent fragmentation involves the reverse of the process by which the nucleon spin is shared by its partons ( the``spin crisis '' ) , and may reveal a similarly mysterious decoupling of valence quark spin and hadron spin for some regions of kinematics .    for the fragmentation of a heavy flavor quark into `` doubly heavy '' mesons , perturbative qcd may provide a starting point to a theoretical determination of the fragmentation functions . as examples , the fragmentation of a c - quark into the @xmath2 or the b - quark into the @xmath3 ,",
    "were calculated several years ago  @xcite .",
    "the reasoning follows the observation that a heavy quark or diquark pair must be produced to form the final hadron .",
    "at least one member of the pair will be nearly on - shell because the heavy flavor hadrons have small binding energies relative to their masses .",
    "so , the gluon producing the heavy pair must carry large squared time - like 4-momentum , @xmath4 .",
    "this gluon will be shaken off by the virtual fragmenting quark and the relevent coupling will be of order @xmath5 , which will be small .",
    "hence perturbative qcd will be applicable .",
    "non - perturbative effects will be incorporated into the binding of the initial quark with the pair produced heavy quark or diquark .",
    "if this is the case , the fragmentation functions are calculable , at an appropriate scale .",
    "the parton shower that accompanies the jet is a result of qcd radiative corrections , which can be obtained from the renormalization group or the altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "such calculations have been performed and scrutinized .",
    "it has been shown that in the heavy quark limit ( i.e. the mass goes to infinity ) the functions have the form expected from more general considerations  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the heavy meson taking all of the heavy quark s momentum ; the distribution becomes a delta function at @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 corrections are calculated also . in any case",
    ", this approach can predict the spin - dependent fragmentation functions along with their momentum and mass dependences . in the heavy mass limit , of course",
    ", the spin of the heavy quark is conserved , so the spin dependence is simple . what is of phenomenological interest is the next order correction , at least , since that has non - trivial spin dependence .",
    "the spin dependences of fragmentation are most readily studied experimentally by observing baryons rather than mesons .",
    "this is true for the production of hyperons or heavy hyperons ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc . ) , wherein the weak , parity violating decays provide polarization analyses  @xcite . to consider fragmentation into baryons in this perturbative scheme , the three quark system has to be confronted .",
    "a simple alternative is to consider the baryons as quark - diquark bound states  @xcite , and to use the same perturbative method as for the mesons . in order for the perturbative calculation to be useful",
    "the creation of a heavy pair of quarks or diquarks must be an intermediate step .",
    "ideally then , doubly heavy baryon fragmentation would be an appropriate testing ground for this scheme .",
    "such data is sparse , however .    to begin to see the structure it will be worthwhile to stretch the region of applicability to the `` singly '' heavy baryons .",
    "we have been carrying out this program to see the expected spin and kinematic dependences , with the hope of providing an experimentally testable model  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been developed independently by martynenko and saleev  @xcite , but with significantly different assumptions about how to represent the diquark structure .",
    "of immediate interest is the question of whether the baryon fragmentation functions have the same kinematic dependence as the meson case . in general the answer",
    "is no in this model .",
    "secondly , does this approach give the right magnitude for fragmentation into heavy flavor baryons ?",
    "with our careful specification of the diquark chromodynamic form factors ( unlike martynenko and saleev ) the answer is yes .",
    "the spin dependent fragmentation is interestingly distinct from the naive heavy quark limit in detail .",
    "the calculations and results will be presented below , along with a comparison with some recent data .",
    "the first calculations of the fragmentation functions in the perturbative scheme were applied to some of the inclusive heavy flavor meson decays of the @xmath10 , as produced at lep  @xcite . the partial width for the inclusive decay process @xmath11",
    "can be written in general for any hadron h as @xmath12 where h is the hadron of energy e and longitudinal momentum fraction z relative to the parton _",
    "i _ , while @xmath13 is the arbitrary scale whose value will be chosen to avoid large logarithms .",
    "the quark and the hadron can carry spin labels as well , and appropriate spin - dependent fragmentation functions will be included , as we will show later . the fragmentation function @xmath14 enters here in a factorized form ( that can be maintained through the evolution equations ) . upon obtaining the @xmath14 in the model to be described , its evolution to observable scales",
    "is developed through summing leading logarithms via evolution equations .",
    "now , consider the final state with one heavy flavor meson , say the @xmath3 for definiteness",
    ". we will soon replace this process by one involving a heavy flavor baryon .",
    "to leading order the @xmath3 meson arises from the production of a pair of b - quarks , in which one of the quarks fragments into the meson . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] illustrates , with @xmath15 , the perturbative contribution involves the virtual b - quark radiating a hard gluon ( we work in axial gauge , so that there is no contribution from the opposite quark ) .",
    "the hard gluon produces a heavy flavor pair of c - quarks .",
    "the gluon must have energy at least twice the charm mass , since the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both on or near their mass shell .",
    "so the coupling @xmath5 is small , justifying the perturbative approach .    for nearly matching 4-velocities ( @xmath18 ) the @xmath19 and @xmath17 form the @xmath3 meson bound state at roughly the same 4-velocity , with amplitude given by various projection operators multiplying the bethe - salpeter wave function @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the @xmath22 relative momentum while p is their sum ) .",
    "since the doubly heavy mesons are weakly bound objects ( the sum of constituents masses are near the bound state mass ) , the wave function is expected to dampen non - zero relative 3-momenta @xmath23 in the hadron rest frame  @xcite , so that the @xmath19 and @xmath17 4-velocities are fixed at @xmath24 .",
    "then the integration over the relative momentum of the two heavy quarks in the full decay probability can be replaced by the squared amplitude evaluated at equal 4-velocities ( for the two constituents and the hadron ) .",
    "the remaining integration over @xmath23 applies to @xmath25 which yields the square of the wave function at the origin in the hadron rest frame . that wave function is known from non - relativistic quark models for the heavy - heavy meson system , or , more directly , from the meson - to - vacuum decay constant .",
    "the same procedure can be applied directly to the baryons , if the quark - diquark model of the baryons is used .",
    "the hard gluon in the process must produce a diquark  anti - diquark pair , @xmath26 , and the diquark ( color anti - triplet ) combines with the heavy flavor quark q to form the baryon @xmath27 .",
    "the relevent wave function will be calculated from a fairly successful quark - diquark model  @xcite .",
    "note that an alternative scenario has been proposed by falk , _ et al .",
    "_ , in which the heavy quark fragments into a heavy diquark first , and then the diquark dresses itself to form the baryon  @xcite with probability of one for the latter .",
    "this leads to very different results , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . this scenario will not be used here , since the processes we are studying involve diquarks that do not necessarily carry the heavy flavor of the quark .",
    "the latter authors  @xcite have performed calculations that are similar in spirit to part of the procedure we follow below , although not emphasizing the spin dependent structure functions that we calculate below .    the tree level amplitude for fig .",

    "the @xmath48 integration ranges from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "since the gluon propagator in the amplitude emphasizes low values of @xmath4 , and the heavy quark propagator favors @xmath48 not far from on - shell ; the major contribution to the @xmath48 integration appears at low @xmath48 .",

    "also , what is of concern here is the time - like region of the form factor . for diquarks , of course",
    ", there is not any direct empirical evidence about their electromagnetic form factors , but diquark - quark models of the nucleon have constrained the parameterization of the form factors . for one thing , the dimensional counting rules lead to @xmath92 asymptotic behavior of nucleon form factors ( at asymptotic momentum transfer the baryon is a three quark system )",
    ". a quark - diquark nucleon must approach this asymptotic behavior also , for consisitency . for a _",
    "point - like _ scalar diquark bound to a quark , the asymptotic behavior will be @xmath93 from dimensional counting for the exclusive pair production .",
    "hence the composite scalar diquark must have an effective coupling to the gluon , i.e. a form factor , that approaches asymptotia as @xmath93 .",
    "since the vector particle has a polarization 4-vector associated with it , an extra power of momentum arises in the asymptotic amplitude .",
    "it becomes necessary for the charge and magnetic form factors to have @xmath92 asymptotic dependence , and the quadrupole @xmath94 behavior .    using a quark - diquark model of the nucleon , and the well measured electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , kroll , _ et al . _",

    "two vector form factors are given @xmath92 asymptotic behavior ( the third is set to zero ) and the scalar behaves as @xmath93 .",
    "for the nucleon form factor study  @xcite as well as a recent study of higher twist contributions to the nucleon structure functions  @xcite , the scalar diquark form factor and vector diquark form factor are assumed to have simple pole and dipole forms , respectively , with pole positions @xmath95 and @xmath96 above 1 gev , @xmath97 the pole position values are somewhat higher than the dipole position for the overall nucleon form factors - near 800 mev if we make the assumption that the color form factors have the same functional form as the electromagnetic form factors , we can proceed .",

    "this implies that the integration region either overlaps or comes near to overlapping the pole positions .",
    "the pole singularities have to be tamed , and the final integration may be very dependent on the method used to moderate the singularities . treating the poles as real resonance positions , including a small imaginary part , on the order of the nearby vector meson width , would be sensible physically .",
    "however , since the color octet form factor would be dominated by color octet vector mesons , and the latter are not expected to be strongly bound or narrow resonances , pole positions with large widths may be preferred .",
    "this would hide our ignorance and provide an interpolation between the space - like and time - like asymptotic regions .",
    "that is the ansatz we adopt .",
    "the neccessity for diquark form factors has an important consequence theoretically . in the light cone expansion",
    ", the baryon production via three quarks would contribute to the leading twist fragmentation functions .",
    "dimensional counting requires the @xmath92 behavior to which we alluded above .",
    "but the diquarks depart from this behavior except at asymptotia .",

    "we take @xmath151 gev and @xmath152 gev .",
    "the baryon masses are taken from the data , so the ratios , @xmath123 of diquark to baryon masses are determined thereby for each baryon .",
    "it is assumed that the difference between a baryon mass and the constituent heavy quark mass plus the diquark mass is negligible , in order that the bethe - salpeter wave functions need be evaluated only at the origin .",
    "the poles that enter the form factors of eq  [ eq : form ] for the ( ud ) diquarks are taken from the electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , @xmath153 gev and @xmath154 gev .",
    "the full width at half maximum for the scalar form factor is set at 0.88 gev and , for simplicity , the vector form factor is assumed to have the same width . recall that the width is introduced so that there are no singularities in the physical region of @xmath48 , the virtuality of the fragmenting quark , or , correspondingly , @xmath4 , the square of the gluon 4-momentum .",
    "it will transpire that the fragmentation probabilities will depend critically on the pole positions and width , since the integration region is dominated by the lowest values of @xmath48 , where the heavy quark is nearly on mass shell . in that region",
    "the poles are nearby .",
    "the pole and width parameters are expected to be different for the ( su ) diquarks .",
    "we take a cue from the electromagnetic form factors of the charged @xmath155 s and @xmath156 s , where the charge radii are roughly in a ratio of 1.3:1 , corresponding to a pole postion that increases by 1.3 for the strange meson .",

    "so , to fix the ( us ) diquark chromodynamic form factors we choose an overall scale factor of 1.4 for the pole positions and the width , slightly bigger than the meson case .",

    "furthermore , using a diquark - quark model of the nucleon to calculate the electromagnetic charge radii and polarizabilities preferred a negative value for @xmath159 .",
    "it is unclear what value to take for this parameter , given the divergence of different methods",
    ".    we will determine a value for @xmath82 by optimizing our model predictions compared to data for the ratio of production probabilities , @xmath160 .",

    "the difference in production probabilities or @xmath143 for these two states depends sensitively on @xmath82 . using the measured value from delphi  @xcite of @xmath164 for the ratio , we choose @xmath165 .",
    "this makes the overall chromomagnetic coupling small and negative ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the reason for this small value is that the ratio @xmath167 would be exactly 1/3 from spin counting if there were no chromomagnetic term at all ; the 1/3 is compatable with the data .",

    "but even at the lep scale , the functions are distinguishable from the peterson function , being peaked at higher @xmath51 and more skewed .",

    "then 2/3 n will be seen in the charged @xmath155 decay mode . the total number of @xmath203 s seen will be @xmath204 ( supressing errors until the end ) .",
    "the number of @xmath203 s not coming from the decays of the 3/2 states will be @xmath205 .",
    "assume that @xmath206 of the @xmath203 s come from other fragmented states decays .",
    "then @xmath207 is the number of direct fragmentation products of the charmed quark .",
    "the ratio @xmath208 of directly fragmented @xmath203 to @xmath209 is given thereby as @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the numbers @xmath206 will come from the radiative decays of the heavier 1/2 states , as well as higher @xmath130 states ( radial and orbital excitations of the @xmath212 and @xmath213 systems ) .",
    "we have calculated the fragmentation functions for the spin 1/2 quark  vector - diquark states and hence the number of @xmath186 spin 1/2@xmath90 states vs. @xmath214 spin 3/2 states .",
    "that is 0.5:1 for the parameterization used in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "assuming @xmath206 is due entirely to these @xmath215 states decaying 100% into the ground state @xmath203 , we have for the different charge states @xmath216 and @xmath217 , both of which are consistent with the ratio of 1.4:1 predicted by the same model calculation .",
    "hence , if the model is taken seriously , and the experimental uncertainties are firm , the data do not require large contributions from fragmentation of the @xmath16-quark into higher excitations of the @xmath130 states .",
    "there are two reasons to be cautious about these experimental numbers , however .",
    "first , the errors are quite large , leaving considerable variation possible within two standard deviations .",
    "secondly , the cleo results are obtained at @xmath218 energy near 10 gev . for the @xmath16-quark jet at roughly 5 gev , the extraction of asymptotically meaningful fragmentation functions is somewhat dubious .    in a previous version of our model  @xcite",
    "our parameterization gave a much larger vector diquark to scalar diquark production probability .",
    "with the more reasonable values now adopted these diquark states and the corresponding baryons are produced with roughly the same probabilities , as the calculations for heavy - heavy baryons by martynenko and saleev  @xcite favored .",
    "finally we consider the spin dependent fragmentation . at this time",
    "there is not enough data to determine @xmath51 dependence for polarization in heavy quark fragmentation .",
    "however , there is a determination of the net longitudinal polarization of @xmath9 produced at lep .",
    "that number is @xmath219 as determined by aleph  @xcite , using a technique suggested by bonvicini and randall  @xcite .",
    "given that the b - quark produced at the @xmath10 pole is expected to have longitudinal polarization of @xmath220 , this measurement gives @xmath221 for the net transfer of helicity from the b - quark to the @xmath9 .",
    "this is rather low if one anticipates that the heavy baryon carries most of the helicity of the heavy quark - the expectation of heavy quark field theory  @xcite .",
    "now the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath9 fragmenting from a positive helicity b - quark is a function of @xmath51 - the ratio @xmath222 for the directly produced @xmath9 ( calculated to leading twist ) .",
    "the integral over @xmath51 of that ratio would give a net polarization .",
    "experimentally , though , the net polarization is obtained by taking each event , regardless of its @xmath51 ( and @xmath223 ) , and calculating a quantity related to its polarization .",
    "the result of this process is to give a net polarization that will be the integral of @xmath137 over @xmath51 divided by the corresponding integral of @xmath143 .",
    "both of these integrals are scale independent . using our fragmentation functions we obtained 0.90 , only marginally lower than the heavy quark limiting value , but still not the small result extracted from the data . however , from our spin independent calculation above and the lep data , we know that the @xmath161 and @xmath162 are produced in relative abundance , and will decay into @xmath224 , so that the polarization will be diluted by these other channels . a heavy quark limit calculation by falk and peskin  @xcite anticipated this circumstance .",
    "they summed the contributions of all of these states in determining the net @xmath9 polarization . using simplifying assumptions",
    ", they obtained about 0.72 for the fractional helicity transfer from the b - quark to the hadron .",
    "that estimate assumed the ratio ( called a in their paper ) of @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( vector diquark states ) to @xmath9 ( scalar diquark states ) of 0.45 . taking that ratio to be 4.8 instead , which is our result and consistent with experiment",
    ", the resulting fractional helicity transfer becomes 0.26 .",
    "falk and peskin also define a parameter @xmath225 which measures the amount of helicity @xmath226 diquark that combines with the heavy quark .",
    "they take that parameter to be zero , whereas we can calculate @xmath225 , which averages over all @xmath51 to be @xmath227 . with our values for both a and @xmath225 we obtain the fractional helicity transfer of 0.46 .",
    "both of these results are near the central value of the measurement . in obtaining these results",
    "we have assumed the heavy quark limiting values of @xmath228 for the polarization of the secondary @xmath9 s resulting from the @xmath161 and @xmath162 decays .",
    "these results will obtain when the chromomagnetic contribution is small , as it is for the @xmath82 we have chosen .",
    "the application of a similar model by saleev  @xcite to @xmath9 production and polarization yields very different results . as we noted above , his production probability is too small .",
    "the polarization for direct @xmath9 is less than ours ( 0.6 to 0.7 ) .",
    "however , it seems that it is the chirality asymmetry ( left - right ) that saleev has calculated , rather than helicity .",
    "it is the latter that is measured experimentally .",
    "we have a much weaker dependence on the diquark mass in our calculation as a result .",
    "a model for fragmentation into heavy flavored baryons has been developed using perturbative qcd and a bethe - salpeter wave function for a quark - diquark system .",
    "this provides the starting point for qcd evolved fragmentation functions .",
    "the parameterization of the diquark structure through the chromodynamic form factors for scalar and vector diquarks is accomplished by using the pole form applied to the electrodynamic form factors .",
    "the kinematic region near these poles is quite important because the integral over the fragmenting quark s virtuality , @xmath48 ( or indirectly , the baryon s transverse momentum at a fixed @xmath51 ) , emphasizes the nearly on - shell region where the corresponding gluon @xmath4 is near the poles .",
    "it is this pole parameterization that is crucial for determining the overall magnitudes of the various production probabilities .",
    "the production probabilities were all close to experimental values , which supports our reasoning about the form factors .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath229 dependences predicted have the common feature of being very sharply peaked at high @xmath51 for the input scale @xmath230 , and more broadly peaked at high @xmath229 . for the 1/2@xmath231 ground states , the @xmath51 dependence of the spin dependent @xmath0 is close to the form for @xmath101 , but their ratio ( which will determine the baryon polarization as a function of z ) is striking . for the higher mass 1/2@xmath231 state containing the vector diquark",
    "the @xmath0 has a very different @xmath51 dependence .",
