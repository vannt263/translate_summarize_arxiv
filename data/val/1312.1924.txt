    "the experimental realization of on - demand electrons and holes sources by means of driven mesoscopic capacitors @xcite or properly designed lorentzian voltage pulses @xcite has opened the way to a new and fast developing branch of mesoscopic physics : _ electron quantum optics_.@xcite its aim is to realize optics - like experiments with electrons which propagate ballistically along chiral edge channels of the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) effect .",
    "the latter play the role of electron wave - guides with no backscattering , while quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) placed downstream act as the equivalent of beam splitters . among the most remarkable results it is worth mentioning the electronic translation of the seminal hanbury - brown - twiss @xcite ( hbt ) and hong - ou - mandel@xcite ( hom ) interferometric experiments . in the first case",
    "the fermionic nature of the electrons clearly emerges in terms of the anti - bunching between the injected electrons and the ones filling the incoming fermi sea at finite temperature.@xcite in the second case two electronic wave - packets are injected towards the qpc on opposite edges with a tunable delay in their emission .",
    "when the emissions are perfectly synchronized one expects a suppression of the noise due to the pauli principle which forces the electrons to emerge on opposite sides of the qpc , while for a very long delay the partition noise of two independent sources is recovered.@xcite experimental observations validate this scenario showing the so called _",

    "incoming and outgoing channels are connected through a scattering region @xmath4 ( shaded yellow square ) , typically given by a qpc .",
    "the possible scattering processes admitted by trs and affecting the current in the @xmath5 outgoing channel are : forward spin - preserving ( dotted green ) , forward spin - flipping ( dotted magenta ) and backward spin - preserving ( dotted orange ) .",
    "pair - electrons sources ( pes ) are placed along the various edges of the sample : @xmath6 ( green ) inject excitations in the ( @xmath5 ) incoming and ( @xmath1 ) outgoing channels , @xmath7 ( magenta ) in the ( @xmath3 ) incoming and ( @xmath2 ) outgoing channels and @xmath8 ( orange ) in the ( @xmath2 ) incoming and ( @xmath3 ) outgoing channels . ]    in recent years , new states of matter showing a topological structure similar to the one of the iqh effect , but in the absence of a magnetic field , have been discovered . in particular",
    ", the two dimensional ( 2d ) realization of these topological insulators is given by the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect,@xcite which was predicted theoretically and observed experimentally in cdte / hgte quantum wells @xcite and more recently also in similar structures realized with inas / gasb.@xcite this state is characterized by a gap in the bulk and peculiar gapless helical edge states @xcite in which electrons with opposite spin ( or opposite total angular momentum @xmath9 ) propagate in opposite directions along the boundaries of the sample as a consequence of the strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "while in cdte / hgte quantum wells these edge states are protected from backscattering by time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , in the new generation of 2d topological insulators the astonishing robustness of the edge states with respect to an in - plane and an out - of - plane magnetic field and the great precision of the conductance quantization seems to suggest a more general topological symmetry related to the spin chern number.@xcite    the existence of topologically protected helical edge states in qsh naturally brings out the question about the possibility to take advantage of their peculiar spin - momentum locking properties in an electron quantum optics perspective .",
    "the first steps in this direction have been achieved very recently in refs .  , where a characterization of the qsh equivalent of the single electron source ( ses ) has been discussed . here ,",
    "as long as the trs is preserved , at each driving period a pair of electrons ( holes ) with opposite spin orientation is injected into the helical channels . the possibility to realize entangled electronic states by means of this kind of devices , as well as possible measurement protocols have been investigated .",
    "however , theoretical predictions concerning electron collisions of the hbt - hom type are still lacking , and constitute our main motivation for the present work .",
    "despite the fact that various denominations have been proposed in the literature for this kind of electronic source@xcite from now on we will refer to it as pair - electrons source ( pes ) to keep in mind both the differences and the similarities with respect to the ses realized in the iqh regime . from a practical point of view",
    ", the experimental realization of a qpc in qsh systems , an essential ingredient for the proposed device , seems difficult to achieve by means of standard electrostatic gating .",
    "this is essentially due to the klein effect , which prevents massless dirac fermion from being confined by a potential , as also observed in graphene .",
    "@xcite however a great experimental effort is devoted to overcome this problem by using new generation heterostructures @xcite or alternative techniques like the mechanical etching of the sample , raising hopes of possible relevant progress in this direction in the near future .",
    "in this paper we consider the pes as an essential building block to realize individual electron interferometric setups ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we focus in particular on the hbt and hom case .",
    "we illustrate the rich phenomenology brought by the helicity of the edge channels .",
    "we observe that in the case of equal spin injection , analogous to the iqh case,@xcite a suppression of the hom dip visibility occurs due to the presence of additional edge channels incoming and outgoing the qpc .",
    "the visibility of the dip crucially depends on the spin - flipping and spin preserving tunneling amplitude at the level of the qpc .",
    "injections of electrons with opposite spins are also possible and lead again , remarkably enough , to hom dips .",
    "this is not a consequence of the pauli principle , but rather of the constraints imposed by trs .",
    "the depth of this dip , called @xmath0 _ dip_,@xcite depends on the channels which are involved as well as on the qpc configuration .",
    "even more interesting is the possibility to consider three - electron injections .",
    "this configuration , which has no correspondence whatsoever in the iqh framework , is reminiscent of three - photon hom experiments proposed in the context of quantum optics @xcite which are within reach of nowadays multimode interference techniques.@xcite such similarity further strengthens the deep connection between these two domains of physics . in the synchronized emission case , one observes a total suppression of the noise due to the interplay between pauli principle and time - reversal symmetry . in the finite delay case ,",
    "different behaviors are possible depending on which interference channel dominates in the transport properties .",
    "the effect of the back - flowing electrons on the functionality of the proposed setup , which is absent in the iqh case due to the chirality , is also discussed in analogy with the double ses case.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we characterize pes and qpc recalling the work of refs . .",
    "in section [ current_noise ] we derive the expression for the outgoing current and noise in terms of the incoming ones by using a scattering matrix picture which is valid in the absence of interactions . in section [ hom ]",
    "we discuss the hom interferometer focusing on both two and three electron injections .",
    "moreover , we provide a discussion of the possible problems associated with the helicity of the edges on the functionality of the sources .",
    "results are summarized in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "an appendix contains details about the derivation of the equations of motion of the system in presence of a qpc and the explicit form of the scattering matrix .",
    "in order to achieve electron quantum optics experiments in the qsh regime we need first to characterize a periodic source able to inject `` on - demand '' a periodic train of electrons and holes into the helical edge channels . in order to do",
    "so we can consider , in close analogy to what was done in the iqh,@xcite a driven mesoscopic capacitor , namely a quantum dot coupled via tunneling to the edges of the qsh bar and capacitively coupled to a gate whose voltage can be periodically modulated in time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this kind of setup can be realized by means of gates that separate the dot from the edge or by properly etching the sample .",
    "note that from now on both the electrons in the dot and the ones on the qsh bar edges will be considered as freely propagating .",
    "moreover we will focus on the zero temperature case .    ) along the edge bar and clockwise along the dot boundary .",
    "spin down electrons ( dashed red ) propagate left - moving ( @xmath1 ) along the edge bar and anticlockwise along the dot boundary .",
    "the dot is capacitively coupled with a top gate ( shaded green square ) driven with a time dependent voltage @xmath10 .",
    "the dot and the edge are coupled via tunneling trough a qpc .",
    "excitations have a probability amplitude @xmath11 to be reflected at the qpc ( full orange arrow ) , a probability amplitude @xmath12 to be transmitted preserving their spin direction ( dotted magenta arrow ) and a probability amplitude @xmath13 to be transmitted while flipping their spin ( dotted green arrow ) . ]",
    "according to the previous considerations , a dot of circumference @xmath14 ( typically in the micrometer range ) presents discrete energy levels with spacing @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the fermi velocity of the electrons ( assumed equal for both the dot and the qsh bar edges for sake of simplicity ) . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that spin up ( down ) electrons move clockwise ( anti - clockwise ) along the edges of the dot and are right - moving ( left - moving ) along the upper edge of the hall bar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "various possible tunneling processes , which are compatible with trs , occur at the point contact which connects the dot with the edge of the qsh bar .",
    "in particular it is possible to have a forward transmission of electron along the edge ( with amplitude probability @xmath11 ) as well as a tunneling into the dot that can both preserve ( with amplitude probability @xmath12 ) or flip ( with amplitude probability @xmath13 ) the electron spin.@xcite    by keeping the two propagating channels along the qsh edge at the same chemical potential ( assumed , for sake of simplicity , to be the energy reference @xmath17 ) , and the dot at a relative constant voltage @xmath18 and subjected to a local magnetic field , the so called frozen in time scattering matrix associated with the mesoscopic capacitor is a @xmath19 matrix given by ( up to a global phase):@xcite = (    _ - & -d^ * d _",

    "the trs is guaranteed only in absence of magnetic field ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "it is easy to note that , under this condition , the scattering matrix becomes diagonal and proportional to the identity .",
    "because of the probability conservation |r|^2+|d|^2+|d_|^2=|r|^2+d=1 , [ d ] @xmath27 being the total probability for an electron to enter into the dot , the diagonal entries @xmath28 of @xmath29 reduces to the scattering matrix already evaluated for the experimentally realized ses.@xcite according to the above considerations , once a periodic voltage is applied to the dot , the driven mesoscopic capacitor realized in the qsh case behaves as two copies of the ses ( one for each spin orientation ) .    in the ses case an optimal regime of emission",
    "is reached when the chemical potential of the edge is set precisely at the middle between two levels of the dot , a square voltage of amplitude @xmath30 is applied to the dot itself and the probability of tunneling into the dot @xmath27 is both not too close to either zero or one.@xcite in this regime an electron is emitted during the first half of the period of the square wave and a hole in the second half .",
    "analogous considerations still hold here,@xcite therefore the described setup is able to inject into the two counter - propagating edge channels a pair of electrons ( in the first half of the period ) and a pair of holes ( in the second half ) with opposite orientation of the spin .",
    "the second step required for a proper analysis of interferometric setups in the qsh regime is the characterization of the qpc connecting the upper and the lower edges of the bar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it acts as a beam splitter for electrons and holes injected along the edges by means of pes .",

    "even more interesting is the possibility to probe the interference of electrons with both opposite spin and chirality q^(2)_r , l()1- e^-|| [ q2_downup ] with @xmath7 ( magenta ) and @xmath8 ( orange ) turned `` on '' while @xmath6 ( green ) is `` off '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and = . here",
    "again it is possible to have a maximum visibility for the hom interferences , with @xmath99 .",
    "this requires @xmath100 , which is obtained for @xmath101 .",
    "the region of maximum visibility is thus a circle of radius 1 in the ( @xmath102 ) plane , as can be seen on the right panel of fig .",
    "when this condition is satisfied the spin preserving forward scattering amplitude @xmath71 is zero ( see eq .",

    "when this condition is satisfied ( namely for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively ) only two possible exit channels remain available for the two electrons and we recover a noiseless output for synchronized electrons , in full analogy with the iqh case . the possibility to have noise suppression also for interferometers involving electrons with opposite spin",
    "is related to the peculiar constraints imposed by trs and charge conservation in the qsh system .",
    "this has been remarked for the first time in ref .   for the continuous current case .",
    "this phenomenon , known as @xmath0 _ dip _ , has also been predicted by inhofer _",
    ".   in the case of periodic injections through pes , however for a specific range of parameters ( @xmath73 , @xmath103 ) , which seems difficult to be obtained in real experiments.@xcite the analysis reported here proves more general , as it not only recovers this previous result , but also predicts the existence of a reduced dip in the more general , experimentally relevant situation , accounting for the decrease in visibility ( encoded in the coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath104 ) due to the multiple scattering processes at the qpc , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "let us consider finally another configuration which is unique to the quantum spin hall effect and which can be seen as the electron quantum optics translation of three - photon hom experiments.@xcite here , all the pes of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are switched on , with possible relative delays in the emissions.@xcite to fix the notation we label @xmath105 the time interval between the injections @xmath106 , and @xmath107 the one for @xmath108 .",
    "consequently @xmath109 corresponds to the delay for @xmath110 . as a natural extension of previous calculations ,",
    "it is possible to define an adimensional noise    @xmath111    note that , for synchronized injections on the three channels , one has q^(3)(_1=0 , _",
    "2=0)=0 _ independently of the characteristics of the qpc_. this total suppression of the noise is a very remarkable feature of helical systems and generalizes both the _ pauli dip _ and the @xmath0 _ dip _ structure .",
    "it depends on the extremely peculiar interplay between the fermionic statistics and the trs in the helical edge states .",
    "this is better illustrated with the help of a simple calculation .",
    "consider , as a simplified version of the three - electron injection , the following input state @xmath112 , corresponding to the creation of three electrons simultaneously in the three input channels @xmath44 , @xmath92 and @xmath81 .",
    "using the expression for the scattering matrix @xmath4 , eq .  , one can rewrite this in terms of the outgoing electronic creation operators as : @xmath113 note that the trs ensures that each input operator @xmath114 is expressed in terms of only three out of the four possible output operators @xmath115 .    expanding this expression , using the unitarity of the scattering matrix and invoking the pauli principle to get rid of all squared operators ,",
    "we are left with @xmath116 this can thus be viewed as the superposition of three possible outgoing states , which all involve the creation of an electron in the @xmath44 output channel , precisely the one where we measure current and noise .",
    "this means , in particular , that there are no current fluctuations in this channel as it is always populated , no matter the final outcome of the scattering process at the qpc . in other words , there can not be any partition noise in the channel of interest for this three - electron injection , a feature which we could attribute to the effect of both trs and the pauli principle .    for non synchronized injections one obtains an extremely rich phenomenology depending on the qpc microscopic parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for example , by changing the properties of the qpc",
    ", one can move from a situation where the noise suppression is roughly independent of @xmath105 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( top panel ) , indicating a dominance of the ( @xmath117 ) interference process , to one in which the hom dip is more pronounced for @xmath118 , a signature of an important contribution of equal spin injection ( @xmath119 ) shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "these considerations open the way to investigate in a unique setup different interference configurations , by tuning the qpc parameters . in a complementary way",
    "this kind of hom measurements represent a useful tool in order to characterize the qpc , providing interesting information about the relative importance between the spin - preserving and the spin - flipping microscopic tunneling amplitudes .     as a function of @xmath105 and @xmath107 ( in units of @xmath88 ) for @xmath120 ( top ) and",
    "@xmath90 ( bottom ) . ]      in order to better characterize our setup in view of an experimental realization of the previously described hom like interferometers using qsh edge states , it is worth commenting about possible drawbacks related to helical propagation of the excitations along the edges .",
    "differently from what happens in the chiral case , here electrons scattered at the qpc can back - flow into another pes altering in principle its functionality . as an example of this we can consider an electron injected in the @xmath81 incoming channel by @xmath8 ( orange ) shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . in general it has a non zero probability to be scattered in the @xmath81 outgoing channel . once arrived in correspondence to @xmath7 ( magenta ) it can affect the emission of an excitation in the same channel , and consequently the one in the @xmath92 incoming channel , in various possible ways : _",
    "i ) _ the arrival of the electron ( hole ) is not synchronized with the emission of the excitations from @xmath7 , _ ii ) _ the arrival of the electron ( hole ) is synchronized with the emission of a hole ( electron ) , _ iii ) _ the arrival of an electron ( hole ) is synchronized with the emission of an electron ( hole ) . in order to discuss these situations we can recover what was done in ref .   for the physically equivalent situation of two ses placed along the same chiral channel of the iqh .",
    "as expected the condition _",
    "i ) _ does nt affect the functionality of @xmath7 due to the independence between arrival and emission .",
    "ii ) _ is more troublesome because the electron ( hole ) could in principle be reabsorbed by @xmath7 leading to the annihilation of the emitted hole ( electron ) .",
    "however it is possible to show that , for asymmetric wave - packets in the time domain ( not time reversal invariant ) as the ones considered here ( see eq .  ( [ wp ] ) ) , this resorption is forbidden and the functionality of @xmath7 is preserved .",
    "this could not be true away from the optimal regime and in particular in the adiabatic regime , where a low frequency sinusoidal drive is applied to the dot @xcite and the emitted wave - packet is lorentzian ( thus symmetric ) in time .",
    "only the final situation _ iii ) _ is truly problematic .",
    "when the arrival of an electron ( hole ) is synchronized with the pair injection , the injected electron is emitted at a higher energy because of the pauli principle .",
    "this can affect the previous discussion ( in particular the parameters of the emitted wave - packet are modified ) .",
    "therefore the setup needs to be engineered in such a way to minimize these effects , namely reduce as much as possible the overlap between the wave - packet of the arriving and of the injected electron .",
    "note that the discussion summarized here can be rigorously derived in a full consistent treatment based on the floquet scattering theory.@xcite",
    "in this paper we considered the possibility to realize electron quantum optics experiments in the framework of new materials relevant to modern condensed matter physics called topological insulators , which have attracted a lot of attention recently , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "we focused on their two - dimensional version exhibiting the qsh effect . by means of pes which inject pairs or electrons and holes into the helical edge channels it is possible to realize hbt and hom interferometers .",
    "focusing on the latter case we have observed a very rich and interesting phenomenology related to the peculiar spin - momentum locking of the electrons propagating along the edges . in the case of a two - electron injection ( with two sources `` on '' and one source `` off '' ) it is possible to realize either an interference between electrons with the same spin ( reminiscent of the hom dip observed in the non interacting iqh case but with a visibility reduced by the presence of additional channels ) or an interference between electrons with opposite spin , where the observed dip is due to the constraints imposed by the topological structure of the edges protected by trs .",
    "the presented setup also allows to realize three - electron injection which is characterized by a total suppression of the noise in the case of perfect synchronization and shows different possible behaviors depending on the qpc spin - preserving and spin - flipping tunneling amplitudes , which can modify the relevance of the different interference contributions .",
    "such three - electron interference phenomenon bears a three - photon equivalent in the context of quantum optics , and have so far eluded investigation in an electronic condensed matter setting .",
    "we have pointed out that our prediction on hom interferometry could in principle be used to characterize the qpc in actual experiments , providing interesting information about the relative importance between the spin - preserving and the spin - flipping microscopic tunneling amplitudes .",
    "possible extensions of this work include the effect of finite temperature , which should not modify drastically our present results as long as the injected electrons are well resolved above the fermi sea . however , finite temperature effects should be of importance when studying collisions between injected electrons and injected holes , as was uncovered in the iqh case.@xcite another issue concerns the effect of interactions , which have been neglected here , but which are known to operate in two dimensional systems with edge channels .",
    "interaction effects could in principle be taken into account in terms of the so called helical luttinger liquid picture for both the edges @xcite and the dot .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a recent work of some of the authors@xcite on iqh bars where edge channels co - propagate however , we suspect that coulomb interaction among the counter - propagating edges could lead to a further reduction of the visibilities of the _ pauli _ and the @xmath0 _ dips _ in our two electron collision predictions , and give rise to a non vanishing of the three particle dip .",
