    "towards realizations of quantum information processors , a variety of physical systems have been proposed and intensively investigated . in particular , solid - state devices with the quantum bits ( qubits ) realized by the spins of electrons confined in quantum dots in semiconductors",
    "@xcite are supposed to be promising in terms of its compatibility with existing semiconductor technology . among them , vertically stacked self - assembled inas quantum dots have advantage of strong confinement of electrons which allows high temperature operation of the order of @xmath0 as opposed to mk in confined 2deg system by schottky electrode.@xcite thus , we have proposed and have been investigating , from both experimental and theoretical aspects , a system with vertically stacked self - assembled inas dots buried in alinas barrier layer in adjacent to the channel of a spin field - effect transistor ( fet ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fet]).@xcite        for quantum information processing , one should be able to perform initialization , quantum gate operations , and readout of the qubits.@xcite in the proposed setup depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : fet ] , the qubits evolve under the interactions with the neighboring qubits and each of them would be rotated via electric spin resonance ( esr ) .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to measure repeatedly the state of the spin of the electron in the edge quantum dot , just above the channel of the fet , by making use of the `` spin - blockade effect , '' as will be recalled in sec .  [",
    "sec : fet].@xcite    although the other qubits than the one on the edge is not directly accessible by the proposed measurement scheme , one can still perform useful operations on the chain of qubits .",
    "multiple qubits can be initialized via repeated measurements only on the edge qubits,@xcite and an entanglement generation was discussed.@xcite in the present article , we show that the _ state tomography _ ( or the _ state reconstruction _ ) is also available .",
    "the determination of the quantum state is a highly nontrivial problem.@xcite a wave function , or more generally a density operator , of the state of a quantum system is not an observable and can not be measured directly . from a practical point of view",
    ", one can see the state only through measurable quantities . in order to gain full information on the state of an @xmath1-level system",
    ", a list of the measured values ( expectation values ) of @xmath2 independent observables is required , with which all the matrix elements of its density matrix are _ reconstructed _ and the _ tomography _ of the state is accomplished .",
    "the state tomography has been carried out for a variety of physical systems to analyze experiments.@xcite we are going to discuss the state tomography in the present setup .",
    "one can measure only the edge qubit ; still , it is possible to reconstruct the state of the _ whole _ chain of the qubits .",
    "the proposed device is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fet].@xcite a series of quantum dots is embedded in the fet structure , just above the channel .",
    "a single electron is confined in each quantum dot and quantum information is encoded on its spin states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a situation where only a single electron is stored in each dot is realized by properly adjusting the gate voltage @xmath5.@xcite each qubit would be rotated via esr to perform single - qubit operations , and the qubits are entangled by the evolution under the interactions between the neighboring qubits .",
    "the fet structure aims at measuring the spin state of the electron confined in the edge quantum dot x. notice first that one can detect the injection of an electron from the channel into the edge dot x by looking at the channel ( source - drain ) current @xmath6 as a function of the gate voltage @xmath5 . as the gate voltage @xmath5",
    "is increased , the channel current @xmath6 increases .",
    "but if an electron tunnels from the channel into the edge dot in the meanwhile , the edge dot is charged and the channel current is suppressed . as a result ,",
    "the channel current @xmath6 drops down and exhibits a peak as a function of the gate voltage @xmath5 ( coulomb - blockade effect ) .",
    "suppose now that the channel electrons are spin polarized in a definite spin state , say @xmath3 .",
    "when the edge electron is in the state @xmath4 , a channel electron in @xmath3 can tunnel into the edge dot at a certain gate voltage @xmath5 , but , on the contrary , when the edge electron is in @xmath3 , the channel electron is not allowed to enter there due to pauli s exclusion principle . therefore",
    ", if the polarized channel current @xmath6 drops down as the gate voltage @xmath5 is increased , one recognizes that the edge electron is in @xmath7 , while the growth of @xmath6 indicates that the edge electron is in @xmath8 . in this way",
    ", one can measure the spin state of the edge qubit x. we call it `` spin - blockade measurement.''@xcite    the feasibility of the present system is discussed in ref .  :",
    "( i ) the selective access to each individual qubit via esr becomes possible by slightly modifying the compound ratio @xmath9 of the @xmath10 quantum dot , since the @xmath11 factor of the electron in a dot is altered in this way @xcite and the esr absorption spectra of the electrons in different dots can be separated ; ( ii ) the strength of the exchange interaction energy between qubits and the corresponding characteristic time scale are estimated , showing the feasibility ; ( iii ) the modulation of the channel current by single electron charging in a quantum dot adjacent to the channel has been demonstrated in a trial structure with a single layer of quantum dot , with unpolarized channel current .",
    "spin - polarized channel will be available by replacing the normal metal electrode with a ferromagnet , candidate materials for which are being intensively investigated : see ref .  .",
    "spin decoherence time has been reported to be @xmath12 for inas self - assembled quantum dots,@xcite while the spin - flipping time is estimated to be @xmath13.@xcite    one of the remarkable features of the spin - blockade measurement is that one can measure @xmath8 _",
    "repeatedly_. although one is allowed to measure only the edge qubit x , this feature enables one to perform useful operations on the chain of qubits .",
    "the initialization of multiple qubits via repeated measurements on the edge qubit and an entanglement generation are discussed in refs .   and .",
    "furthermore , the present article clarifies that the _ tomography _ of the state of the _ whole _ qubits x+a+b+@xmath14 is also possible via the spin - blockade measurements only on the _ edge _ qubit x.",
    "in the proposed setup , it is possible to measure the state @xmath8 of the edge qubit x. but at the same time , the measurement of @xmath7 implies that a channel electron in @xmath3 has been injected into the edge dot and the edge qubit x has been destroyed .",
    "furthermore , other qubits than x are out of the reach of the spin - blockade measurement .",
    "still , there is a way to get the full information about the state of the whole chain of the qubits .    to measure different states of x from @xmath8 without loosing it by the injection of a channel electron",
    ", we apply a spin rotation just before a spin - blockade measurement . for instance",
    ", finding x in @xmath8 just after rotating x by the angle @xmath15 around the @xmath16 axis is essentially the measurement of the spin x oriented in the @xmath9 direction [ a superposed state @xmath17 before the rotation . in this way",
    ", it is possible to measure any state of x.    the idea for getting information about the states of other qubits than x is to make use of the entangling dynamics of the chain of the qubits and the collapse of the state by the measurement on x. although we are allowed to measure only x , such measurement would reflect the state of the other qubits due to the entanglement between x and the rest .",
    "the strategy for the state tomography of the whole chain of the qubits is therefore the following .",
    "the qubits x+a+b+@xmath14 evolve , from a given state @xmath18 to be reconstructed , under the action of the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the spin operator of qubit @xmath21 . during the evolution ,",
    "we rotate some qubits and measure @xmath8 a few times at definite timings according to a certain recipe .",
    "we prepare the same initial state @xmath18 and perform such a fixed sequence of operations many times to obtain the probability for every measurement in the sequence to find x in the state @xmath8 .",
    "( notice that the measurement at the end of a sequence can be @xmath7 , since we do not need to proceed further . )    consider , for instance , the following series of operations : ( rotation of x by an angle @xmath22 around the @xmath9 axis ) @xmath23 ( wait for time @xmath24 ) @xmath23 ( measurement of @xmath8 ) @xmath23 @xmath14 @xmath23 ( measurement of @xmath7 ) .",
    "the probability of getting the relevant result at every measurement implemented in the series is given by @xmath25\\\\ & = { \\mathop{\\text{tr}}\\nolimits}\\ { \\varrho   [ r_x^{\\text{(x)\\dag}}(\\theta)u^\\dag(\\tau)p_\\uparrow\\cdots p_\\downarrow \\cdots p_\\uparrow u(\\tau)r_x^\\text{(x)}(\\theta ) ] \\ } , \\label{eqn : prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the operator that rotates qubit @xmath21 by an angle @xmath22 around the @xmath27 axis , @xmath28 is the projection operator that represents the measurement of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the time - evolution operator between two operations and entangles the chain of the qubits .",
    "this is the quantity that we can measure in the present system .",
    "it can be viewed as the expectation value @xmath31 of a hermitian operator @xmath32 in the relevant state @xmath18 , where @xmath32 consists of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and so on . therefore , by suitably arranging the sequences of the operations , we can collect the sufficient number ( @xmath36 for an @xmath37-qubit system ) of expectation values of linearly independent operators that allow us to reconstruct the given state @xmath18 .",
    ".fifteen linearly independent sequences of operations sufficient to reconstruct a state of two qubits .",
    "@xmath38 is the coupling constant between the two qubits . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have considered the imperfection of the spin - blockade measurement due to the partially polarized spin channel . the present formalism [ eq .  ( [ eqn : nonidealmeas ] ) ] would however be applicable to other physical origins of imperfections , including imperfect pauli blocking.@xcite the meaning of the parameter @xmath39 is just to be reinterpreted .",
    "towards the tomography of multiple qubits ( with @xmath40 ) , there exists a scheme applicable for an arbitrary number of qubits @xmath37 .",
    "here is the recipe : we consider four sequences of operations @xmath41^{n-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dimension of the @xmath37-qubit system and @xmath45 represents a rotation of x defined by @xmath46 let @xmath47 denote the probability of finding x in @xmath8 successively @xmath1 times up to the @xmath1th measurement , which is given by @xmath48^{n-1 } p_\\uparrow r_{\\theta_0\\varphi_0}^\\text{(x)}\\varrho \\nonumber\\displaybreak[0]\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad { } \\times r_{\\theta_0\\varphi_0}^\\text{(x)\\dag}p_\\uparrow [ u^\\dag(\\tau)r_{\\theta\\varphi}^\\text{(x)\\dag}p_\\uparrow]^{n-1 } \\ }",

    "the determinant ( [ eqn : vandermondedeterminant ] ) is the product of all the differences that can be formed by any pairs taken from @xmath61 .",
    "it is therefore clear when it is possible to invert the relation ( [ eqn : linearrel ] ) to reconstruct the density operator @xmath62 of a+b+@xmath14 : the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath63 should be chosen so as to satisfy the conditions @xmath64 in this way , one gets a list of @xmath62 for the four independent sets of @xmath65 , which completes the tomography of the state @xmath18 .",
    "this scheme is quite simple and general : one simply repeats @xmath66 necessary times , the scheme works for an arbitrary number of qubits @xmath37 , and the conditions for the parameters are clear [ eq .  ( [ eqn : conditionmulti ] ) ] . only four independent sequences are required , irrespective of the number of qubits @xmath37 .",
    "in this article , we have discussed the state tomography for a chain of qubits in the setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fet ] ) proposed as a possible physical realization of a quantum information processor . in this setup ,",
    "only the state of the edge qubit of the chain is measurable via the spin - blockade measurement .",
    "however , the present analysis explicitly demonstrates that it is still possible to reconstruct the state of the whole chain of qubits .",
    "the idea is to make use of the entangling dynamics of the qubits , which enables one to gain information on the whole chain through the edge qubit .",
    "such an idea is not restricted to the current setup : there would be various physical systems in which only limited degrees of freedom are accessible in practice and similar strategies are required .",
    "the present idea would find many valuable applications .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : idea ] , we have explicitly constructed a recipe for two qubits .",
    "we have also presented a general scheme based on repeated measurements that can be applied to an arbitrary number of qubits ( sec .",
    "[ sec : multiqubits ] ) .",
    "there are , however , many other possibilities .",
    "for instance , the latter scheme requires @xmath67 measurements for @xmath37 qubits , i.e.  4 measurements for 2 qubits , while each sequence in table  [ tab : seqtwoqubits ] involves only 2 measurements . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : partialpolarization ] , the accuracy of the spin - blockade measurement relies on the polarization of the channel spins . for",
    "a partially polarized spin channel , it would be better to seek a scheme with fewer measurements . shorter sequences of operations would be preferable also to minimize other possible errors , originating for instance from imperfect qubit rotations by esr and decoherence during the processes .",
    "there would exist recipes that involve only one measurement ( and therefore with fewer rotations and a shorter execution time ) for each sequence , but no general prescription for generating such sequences of operations is known ( at least to the present authors ) .",
    "a possible strategy would be to generate sequences according to a certain rule anyway , to select necessary number of sequences ( since too many sequences might be generated for the reconstruction of a density operator with @xmath36 independent matrix elements ) , and to check the invertibility of the relevant matrix relating the matrix elements of the target density operator to the observable data .",
    "it is desirable to clarify how to generate the optimal sequences efficiently , which remains a future subject .",
