    "the study of the dynamics of cold atoms near suspended graphene samples presents opportunities to explore some of the foundational concepts of quantum mechanics .",
    "since the binding energy of an atom on graphene is comparable to graphene s quantum excitation energies , the dynamics depends on a quantum treatment of excitations .",
    "even the atomic motion must be treated quantum mechanically for sufficiently cold atoms .",
    "thus the theory of cold atom adsorption on graphene must be a fully quantum theory .    from a practical perspective , information gleaned from dynamical studies of cold atoms near surfaces",
    "will likely find use in the development and refinement of systems and devices for quantum sensing and information processing . in recent years",
    ", there have been many experimental advances in the cooling and control of atoms and molecules .",
    "picokelvin sources of helium atoms can now be experimentally prepared @xcite , and new technologies propose to use quantum states of cold atoms and molecules to store and process information @xcite .",
    "one example of these potential applications is realized in the `` atom chip , '' a microelectronic device where currents flowing through nanowires generate magnetic fields to process information stored in the quantum states of cold atoms .",
    "a second example is in quantum metrology .",
    "this includes applications such as recently developed chip - scale atomic clocks using cold @xmath0rb atoms @xcite .",
    "the operation of these devices will be strongly impacted @xcite by how cold atoms and molecules interact with surfaces .",
    "hence our theoretical studies will impact performance and design of these emerging applications ; for example , unintended adsorption of alkali metal atoms leads to the so - called `` patch effect , '' where random islands of dipoles can cause a rapid dephasing of entangled states of atoms trapped above surfaces .",
    "another potential application is in `` atom optics '' where matter - waves play the role conventionally performed by laser light in optical systems @xcite . enhancing the reflection of matter waves from surfaces",
    "might be used to make low - loss atomic mirrors @xcite , waveguides for atom interferometers @xcite or microtraps for the quantum information processing of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "research in the field of cold atom - surface interactions traces back to the beginning years of quantum theory , where the threshold behavior for quantum adsorption was first explored by lennard - jones @xcite .",
    "early theoretical work concluded that the sticking probability s(e ) of a particle with incident energy e near threshold is directly proportional to the square of the transition matrix element and varies inversely with the incident particle flux , such that s(e ) @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "more recent studies @xcite have predicted new scaling laws for neutral and charged particles based on quantum many - body effects , such as orthogonality catastrophe - type phenomena .",
    "for inelastic interactions , the primary channel of energy exchange involves the creation and annihilation of phonons .",
    "free - standing graphene has two in - plane acoustic modes and one out - of - plane flexural mode .",
    "the flexural mode has a quadratic dispersion near the zone center ; however , under uniform tension , the flexural dispersion becomes linear , leading to vanishing phonon density of states ( dos ) for suspended graphene .",
    "in contrast to a constant dos at zero frequency , a linear dos eases a well - known divergence in the displacement autocorrelation function of the @xmath3 nearest neighbors @xmath4 in two dimensions @xcite and stabilizes the suspended layer mechanically , circumventing the `` crumpling '' instability . in the case of inelastic atom - graphene interactions ,",
    "vestiges of this divergence can be found in a perturbative expansion of the atom s self - energy @xcite .",
    "the linear dos of the flexural phonons , when combined with the frequency - dependent atom - phonon coupling gives a ( log ) divergent atom self - energy at zero temperature .",
    "this implies that without a low - frequency cut - off , the second - order shift in the binding energy of a light atom on suspended graphene is formally divergent @xcite .",
    "recent numerical calculations on the physisorption of atomic hydrogen to suspended graphene @xcite do not take into account the effect of this infrared divergence which remains a theoretical challenge .",
    "in the present work , we use a diagrammatic approach to study the dynamics of quantum sticking near graphene membranes .",
    "the quantum sticking probability is related to the damping rate of the atom , calculated from its self - energy .",
    "in fact , the study of atom self - energy to probe various aspects of atom - surface scattering is not a recent one and has been explored before @xcite .",
    "the presence of infrared divergent terms , due to many emitted low - energy flexural phonons , has been previously pointed out @xcite , and our goal in this work is to provide a systematic study of these effects in the context of renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "we will consider membranes at finite temperature t , where the infrared divergence problem is especially severe since the number of thermally - activated phonons tends to infinity with increasing membrane size .",
    "however , there is a well - defined way to take into account ( through resummation ) such infrared - singular processes ; especially suggestive is an exact solution for a particle ( atom ) interacting with a bath of phonons ( independent boson model @xcite ) , even though our problem is not exactly solvable in the same sense due to the presence of two types of atom - phonon couplings @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , the problem under consideration is also technically similar to the infrared problems present in finite - t  hot \" quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) due to the long - range , unscreened , nature of gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "these problems are usually resolved within the finite t generalization of the so - called bloch - nordsieck scheme @xcite , which extracts the exact infrared behavior of the theory by summing the most important feynman diagrams ; it is quite similar to the exact solution of the independent boson model ( ibm ) for single atom ",
    "phonon bath mentioned previously .",
    "physically this corresponds to the correct account of the damping provided by many emitted phonons , and we will implement similar schemes to obtain the sticking rate of adatoms ( equivalent to calculating the atomic damping rate ) .    since the infrared divergences are caused by emitted low - momentum phonons @xmath5 , at any finite - t around the debye temperature , the system is effectively in the high temperature ( hot ) limit as far as its infrared properties are concerned , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the flexural phonon speed .",
    "similar to the case of hot qed , this allows for a particularly theoretically clean and elegant way to perform resummation of the leading infrared divergences which come as powers of logarithms .",
    "we present a detailed study of the atomic self - energy at one and two loops , and subsequently perform resummation of the leading infrared terms in the spirit of the ibm or hot qed , but adapted for our two - channel situation .",
    "this allows us to obtain reliable non - perturbative results for the damping rate as a function of temperature ( t ) as well as membrane size ( l ) , which serves as the effective infrared cutoff in the problem .",
    "the description of these dependencies and the theoretical methodology we use to calculate them is the main goal of this work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the effective model of atoms interacting with graphene membranes . in section  [ sec : div ] , we analyze the infrared divergences that appear up to two - loops and then present the non - perturbative solution in the spirit of the ibm in section  [ sec : ibm ] . our results for a h atom s sticking rate as a function of temperature and size are collected in section  [ sec : stick ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "some technical aspects of high - order perturbation theory are presented in appendices a and b.",
    "we study the interaction of a cold atom with a clamped , elastic membrane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) , where the inelastic interaction between the atom and the membrane occurs through the creation and annihilation of flexural phonons of the membrane . for atoms focussed near the center of the suspended membrane ,",
    "the circularly symmetric modes dominate the inelastic scattering .",
    "thus we consider the atom interactions with only the axisymmetric ( @xmath8 ) modes @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as @xmath9 .",
    "the terms represent the hamiltonian for the particle , phonon - bath and the coupling term , respectively , and are given as : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12    here , @xmath13",
    "@xmath14 annihilates ( creates ) a particle in the entrance channel @xmath15 with energy @xmath16 ; @xmath17 @xmath18 annihilates ( creates ) a particle in the bound state @xmath19 with energy -@xmath20 in the potential of a static membrane in its initial equilibrium position ; @xmath21 @xmath22 annihilates ( creates ) a phonon in the membrane with energy @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the coupling strength of phonon - assisted transitions of the atom between continuum @xmath15 and bound state @xmath19 ; @xmath25 is the coupling strength of the bound atom to flexural phonons .",
    "the form of @xmath26 depends on the specific particle - excitation coupling , and particularly in this model , @xmath26 is @xmath27-independent@xcite .",
    "we take the membrane to be initially in thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath28 , while the atoms have an initial energy of @xmath29 .",
    "the atom self - energy must be calculated using non - equilibrium green functions ( keldysh or the contour - ordered green functions ) .",
    "the feynman rules using the keldysh formalism are summarized below for our model :    * the solid dot corresponds to the interaction vertex @xmath24 .",
    "* the open dot corresponds to the interaction vertex @xmath25 .",
    "* lines labeled by @xmath30 correspond to the bare ( retarded ) green function in the bound state @xmath31 * lines labeled by @xmath32 correspond to the bare ( retarded ) green function of the atom in the continuum state @xmath33 .",

    "each diagram is weighted by @xmath39 , where n is the number of phonon loops .",
    "two additional comments are in order .",
    "first , we also assume that , by definition , the ground state is the initial ( symmetric ) vacuum of the phonons .",
    "it is possible that at low temperature , the phonons could condense , leading to finite membrane displacement and a symmetry - broken state ; such a scenario was considered previously by one of us within a mean - field theory approach applied to this model@xcite .",
    "the present study can not shed light on that result , since we aim to collect the leading infrared - divergent terms that happens essentially in the  high - temperature \" regime ( @xmath6 , and @xmath40 ) and we are under the ( well - satisfied ) weak - coupling condition @xmath41 ( and @xmath42 ) , where @xmath43 is either @xmath44 or @xmath45 , with dimension of energy when appropriately written ( see below ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "a perturbative expansion around the symmetric vacuum seems well justified ; however , we certainly can not rule out the possibility of symmetry breaking .    finally , we mention that the diagram technique constructed above is completely equivalent to simply working with the real - time finite temperature green s function for the phonons @xcite .",
    "this can be easily seen by examining the structure of the one - loop result eq .   and the way it follows from eq .  .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that for the purposes of extracting the leading , infrared - divergent logarithmic terms , it is sufficient to use the small momentum / high temperature limit of the phonon propagator in the form @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "fgraphs    ( 100,100 )    ( 100,100 )",
    "applying the above feynman rules , we find the finite temperature atom self - energy at the 1-loop level is given by +    digram    ( 80,80 )    @xmath47 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    since we take the incoming particle to be out of equilibrium with the phonon bath with the green function @xmath48 , we obtain : @xmath49 \\end{split}\\\\ % \\end{equation }   % \\begin{equation}\\label{6 } \\begin{split }   & = g_{kb}^{2}\\xi^{2}\\sum_{q}\\bigg[\\frac{n_{q}}{e+e_{b0}+\\omega_{q}-i\\eta}\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{n_{q}+1}{e+e_{b0}-\\omega_{q}+ i\\eta}\\bigg ] \\end{split}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next , in the continuum limit , we obtain the real and the imaginary part of @xmath50 for the high temperature case ( @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is membrane debye frequency ) . in this high temperature limit ,",
    "we approximate @xmath53 ( we choose convenient units where the velocity of sound @xmath54 ) . also , we consider the energy regime @xmath55 , and call @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ( constant ) vibrational density of states . from previous work @xcite , we take @xmath58 .    as a result ,",
    "we conclude that the real and the imaginary parts are given as : @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the infrared cutoff estimated to be the minimum phonon frequency , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the characteristic membrane size ( radius ) , which will be a parameter in our model .",
    "although the imaginary part is completely finite , eq .   shows that the real part of the finite temperature atom self - energy is log - divergent for infrared frequencies .",
    "a similar expression can be derived for the 1-loop bound state self - energy @xmath64 corresponding to a feynman diagram similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloop ] with @xmath24 replaced with @xmath25 .",
    "the expressions for the real and imaginary @xmath64 are given as : @xmath65 @xmath66    the values of @xmath25 and @xmath24 depend on the form of the attractive ( van der waals ) potential between the atom and the membrane ; for a h atom impinging on suspended graphene , we will take them from previous work @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath24 has a strong energy dependence , @xmath67 where @xmath29 is the atom s initial energy .",
    "this energy dependence will be taken into account in our final results .",
    "the coupling @xmath68 is independent of @xmath29 , and in addition , is much larger than @xmath44 ( for all @xmath29 considered ) .",
    "@xmath69    the ratio of these couplings for an h atom is typically @xmath70 . because of this inequality , the bound state self - energy behavior in higher orders will be numerically much more important than the corresponding higher order contributions to the continuum self energy .",
    "thus we first proceed to investigate the next order in powers of @xmath45 .",
    "we now turn to a calculation of the 2-loop bound state self - energy corresponding to the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] .",
    "first , we evaluate the vertex correction diagram by using the vertex function @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] ) .    2loop    ( 100,100 )    ( 100,50 )    following the feynman rules , we find the following expression for @xmath71 @xmath72\\times\\bigg[\\frac{1}{[e+e_{b0}-\\omega'+i\\eta]}\\\\ & \\quad \\times \\frac{1}{[e+e_{b0}-\\omega-\\omega'+i\\eta]}\\bigg ] \\end{split}\\ ] ]    vertices1    ( 80,80 )    in the continuum limit , we call @xmath73 , so that the real and the imaginary parts of the vertex function @xmath71 are written as @xmath74 @xmath75    using eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) , we find the contribution to the vertex correction diagram",
    ". the analytical expression for @xmath64 is written as @xmath76 substituting , we conclude that the real part of @xmath77 is given by @xmath78^{2}\\ ] ]    a similar expression can be easily obtained for the contribution from the rainbow diagram .",
    "thus , the above calculations show that @xmath79 for both the 1-loop and the 2-loop is plagued by log and log - squared infrared divergences , respectively .",
    "therefore , at the 2-loop level , @xmath80 is given by @xmath81^{2 } + \\cdots \\end{split}\\ ] ]    given the above structure of the expansion , it is clear that in the infrared limit @xmath82 , resummation of the series must be performed to obtain reliable results .",
    "this turns out to be possible and the infrared dynamics of the result is equivalent to that of the exact green s function , @xmath83 , of the independent boson model @xcite .",
    "we can show that one can use dyson s equation @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the unperturbed bound state green s function and the bound state self - energy , respectively , and then derive a perturbative expression for @xmath83 that matches exactly the perturbative structure of the exact bound state green s function corresponding to the ibm .",
    "this is indeed natural since both the ibm and the part of our model involving @xmath87 transitions describe physically equivalent situations ( a phonon bath coupled to a single particle ) .    with the presence of the second ( @xmath88 ) channel",
    ", our model can be viewed as a generalization of the ibm with two coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; however , due to the strong inequality eq .  , the infrared behavior originating from higher order processes in the @xmath88 channel is strongly suppressed and will be neglected .",
    "for example , one - loop ( logarithmic ) corrections to the @xmath17 channel propagator due to mixing with the @xmath89 channel are of order @xmath44 , much smaller than the pure @xmath87 channel contribution @xmath45 calculated above .",
    "thus the relative contribution of these processes is smaller by a factor of @xmath70 , based on calculations for h atom .",
    "higher order processes are suppressed even stronger .    on the other hand",
    "we are ultimately interested in the green s function of the @xmath89 channel ( section  [ sec : stick ] ) , and its dominant perturbative correction , as outlined in appendix a , originates at order @xmath90 .",
    "this is the dominant part in a sense that it is much larger than the pure mixing contribution of order @xmath91 , which can be neglected due to the same reasoning as above .",
    "additional evidence in favor of this overall strategy is based on analysis of higher - order contributions to the two vertices , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as performed in appendix b. we find that the effective vertex @xmath45 grows , while @xmath44 decreases under renormalization ( i.e. upon including higher order singular corrections ) .",
    "these results provide further justification in favor of asymmetric treatment of the two couplings ( channels ) within the model .",
    "thus we will follow the strategy of keeping the lowest necessary power of @xmath44 while treating the @xmath87 channel non - perturbatively .",
    "based on the previous analysis we proceed to calculate the exact @xmath87 green s function which will provide the dominant contribution to the atom damping rate , to be calculated in the next section . as already mentioned ,",

    "we provide detailed predictions for the sticking rate of h atoms as a function of temperature and size .",
    "sticking is generally enhanced relative to the conventional fermi golden rule result ( which is equivalent to the lowest , 1-loop perturbative term ) which is natural since higher order processes are required to increase damping at finite temperature .",
    "although we observe an enhancement from the golden rule result , we still see the trend of decreasing sticking rates for low energies , contrary to some recent results , where numerical calculations predict an increased sticking rate with low incident energies @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noticing , as we mention in the introduction , that our approach is very similar in spirit to the calculation of fermion damping rates in  hot \" qed and qcd , where the gauge structure of the theory is not particularly important as far as infrared properties are concerned .",
    "this problem has a long history , and the relevant theoretical approach , based on the finite temperature version of the bloch - nordsieck method , relies on exponentiation of infrared - divergent perturbation series ( and is thus similar to the solution of the independent boson model in solid state theory . )",
    "the role of the long - range gauge propagator is played in our case by the phonon propagator .",
    "there are also important differences between our results and those in hot gauge theories .",
    "one difference , which has experimental consequences for the damping rate , is the residual dependence on the infrared cutoff , which can be traced to the quasi-1d nature of our problem ( in the sense that a normally incident atom excites only axisymmetric flexural phonons ) . on the other hand",
    ", our perturbative expansion does not contain any polarization loop corrections ( which are important ingredients of hot gauge theories ) , since in the case of a single atom interacting with phonon bath , those are completely absent from the theory .",
    "we envisage applications of our approach to related physical systems , such as graphene under additional uniaxial strain , and other atomically thin materials , for example dichalcogenides and similar systems . in these materials",
    "various types of strain are expected to exist @xcite , as well as larger ( compared to graphene ) spin - orbit interactions",
    ". additional uniaxial strain for example also affects strongly the van der waals potential near the surface @xcite .",
    "therefore the atom damping rate is expected to be very sensitive to the physical characteristics of the atom - surface interactions , such as the strain - modified shape of the phonon flexural modes and the van der waals interactions between atoms and surfaces which determine the bound state energies and corresponding atom - phonon coupling parameters .",
    "sanghita sengupta would like to thank nathan s. nichols and adrian del maestro for their help with the figures in the manuscript .",
    "the research of v. n. kotov was supported by the u.s .",

    "here we calculate the 2-loop atom self - energy corresponding to the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloopappendix ] .",
    "these are the leading diagrams with two loops which reflect the change of the self - energy in the open @xmath89 channel due to the influence of the @xmath17 channel .",
    "2loopatom    ( 100,100 )    ( 100,50 )    we begin our calculation by deriving an analytical expression for the vertex function @xmath71 which is given by a diagram topologically similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] , but in the @xmath88 channel : @xmath159\\times \\bigg[\\frac{1}{[e+e_{b0}-\\omega'+i\\eta]}\\\\ & \\quad \\times \\frac{1}{[e+e_{b0}-\\omega-\\omega'+i\\eta]}\\bigg ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the continuum limit , we have , @xmath160\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{q } \\end{split}\\ ] ] under the approximation , @xmath161 and calling @xmath73 , the real and the imaginary parts of the vertex function @xmath71 are written as : @xmath162 similarly , the imaginary part is given as @xmath163 using the vertex function @xmath71 , we derive the contribution from the vertex - corrected self - energy first .",
    "the analytical expression can be written as @xmath164 performing the calculation , we find an expression for the real part of @xmath165 : @xmath166^{2 } \\label{twoloopappendix}\\ ] ] a similar expression is derived for the contribution from the rainbow diagram .",
    "thus , the above calculations show that the real part of @xmath167 at two - loop order is log squared infrared divergent .",
    "now we calculate the vertex renormalization for the two different types of vertices in our model .",
    "the one loop vertex diagrams are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : twovertices ] . +              the corrections to the vertices are represented as @xmath168 and @xmath169 . by evaluating the corresponding diagrams we obtain for the infrared - divergent parts : @xmath170 @xmath171 here , the external phonon frequency",
    "is set to zero ( infrared limit ) , while @xmath146 is the external atom energy .",
    "the most important feature of these results is that the corrections have different signs , i.e. while the @xmath88 vertex decreases , the @xmath87 vertex increases .",
    "it is possible to write down and solve the corresponding dyson equations for the fully renormalized vertex functions , which is equivalent to summing an infinite series of ladder diagrams as is conventionally done in qed @xcite .",
    "this results in the following expressions for the effective vertices in the two channels : @xmath172 and @xmath173 again , it is clear that @xmath174 decreases while @xmath175 increases in the infrared limit .",
    "@xmath175 in fact contains a landau pole , although due to the smallness of the effective coupling , the system never reaches the pole for physical values of the parameters ( coupling , temperature and cutoff ) .",
    "finally , we consider even higher order renormalization effects . for the @xmath88 vertex , the next level of complexity",
    "is represented by the crossed vertex corrections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossedvertex ] . by evaluating the diagram",
    "we obtain @xmath176 which confirms that the @xmath88 vertex keeps decreasing .",
    "corresponding results can be derived for the @xmath87 vertex ( which experiences an increase ) .",
    "these results are conceptually important because they reaffirm the different tendencies in the two channels , although numerically these diagrams are very small for physical parameter values .",
