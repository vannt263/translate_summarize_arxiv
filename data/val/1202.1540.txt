    "in computational mechanics , the complexity of a process that generates a single time series is defined as the least amount of information required for a maximally accurate statistical description of the series @xcite .",

    "shalizi et al.extended the definition to spatially  extended dynamical systems and introduced an algorithm for measuring the complexity of a discrete system given time series data for all components @xcite .",
    "applying the algorithm to 2d cyclic cellular automata ( cca ) confirmed that it classified cca rules generating fixed states or incoherent local oscillations as having low complexity and cases that produce turbulent spiral waves as having high complexity .",
    "shalizi s complexity measure , @xmath0 , is defined as the amount of information stored in local causal states , where a causal state is an equivalence class of all past configurations that give rise to the same distribution of future outcomes .",
    "a set of causal states can be discerned from time series data for all elements in the system .",
    "@xmath0 is obtained by measuring correlations between truncated past and future light cones associated with each element in the system .",
    "the formalism developed by shalizi et al .",
    "is intriguing due to its principled application of information theoretic concepts to the analysis of complex dynamical systems .",
    "it is not immediately clear , however , how the formalism can be applied to random or heterogeneous networks .",
    "we show here that a natural extension requires distinguishing between averages over nodes and averages over time , and also that the relevant quantities can be computed analytically for certain classes of random boolean networks .",
    "our primary goal is to clarify the meaning of shalizi s complexity measure . in doing so ,",
    "we propose a new measure of the information processing occurring at a given node , which gives a new statistic for distinguishing the roles played by different nodes in a complex network .",
    "we show that this measure depends upon global features of the dynamics and , in particular , that it is not simply related to the sensitivity of the network and is not maximized in critical networks . along the way , we also present a conjecture concerning the dynamics of boolean networks consisting only of parity functions .",
    "we study two complexity measures that differ only in the choice of the ensembles of spacetime points used for averaging the local complexity .",
    "one approach considers the ensemble of all spatial points at the same time instant , which corresponds to shalizi s @xmath0 . in computing @xmath0 ,",
    "all nodes are given equal weight in determining the probabilities of observing different states .",
    "shalizi et al .",
    "used @xmath0 to investigate self - organization of cellular automata , which are logically and topologically uniform networks of discrete , interacting elements .",
    "a second approach is to assign a complexity to each individual element by averaging over time .",
    "the system average of these individual complexities is denoted @xmath1 . for a homogeneous system in which all elements have statistically indistinguishable time series ( a regular lattice with rules that lead to turbulent dynamics , for example ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the same .",
    "we suggest that @xmath1 is the one that is most informative for spatially inhomogeneous systems .    to develop conceptual insights into the behavior of the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we study their dependence on the parameters specifying different ensembles of random boolean networks ( rbns ) .",
    "rbns were first studied by kauffman as toy models of gene regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "they have garnered much attention in the last few decades , and features such as steady - state bias , sensitivity to perturbations , attractor length and mutual information between nodes have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "we show here that for any given distribution of logic functions , the value of @xmath0 for a rbn can be analytically calculated as a function of the bias @xmath2 and is not simply related to the sensitivity @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 on the other hand , is always near zero for sensitivity values @xmath4 , where the network is in the ordered or critical regime , and is also zero for the highest possible @xmath3 value , where the network dynamics is strongly chaotic .",
    "thus @xmath1 reflects the intuitive notion that systems with short periodic cycles or apparently random behavior should both have low complexity .",
    "the maximum of @xmath1 for rbns occurs somewhere in the disordered regime .",
    "we find also that the amount of information processed by any given individual depends on global properties of the network dynamics as well as the logic functions of the node in question and others in its neighborhood .",
    "section ii defines the two measures @xmath0 and @xmath1 in detail .",
    "section iii describes an implementation of these definitions in the context of rbns and presents theoretical and numerical results on the complexity of a certain class of rbns .",
    "the relation between network complexity and sensitivity , and the relation between individual nodes complexity and role in determining the network dynamics is also discussed .",

    ", we obtain a global complexity measure @xmath1 .    in practice , estimating the complexity requires restricting the depths of the light cone configurations to a manageable size .",

    "we study the simplest nontrivial case , in which all nodes have exactly two inputs and two outputs .",
    "for these networks , the greatest possible sensitivity is @xmath52 .    ref .",
    "@xcite outlined an algorithm for computationally distinguishing the causal states of cellular automata , and we can implement similar procedures to distinguish the causal states of our rbns . because nodes in rbns are not assigned spatial positions , the definition of @xmath13 and @xmath53 requires some technical modifications . in the calculation of @xmath0 , @xmath54 of node @xmath37 at time",

    "although the update rules ( eq .  [ eq : rbn ] ) contain indices for node inputs , the calculation of statistical complexity is defined without reference to the underlying physical laws and hence without the knowledge of which input is which at any given node .    for calculating the complexity @xmath59 of an individual node , however , different inputs and outputs are distinguishable . when comparing two past or future light cone configurations of the same node _",
    "i _ at different time steps , one can keep track of which input is which and observe that when the two inputs differ , the future light cone configuration depends upon which input value is 1 .",

    "the the lack of memory in the update rules ensures that all the relevant information for determining the state of a node is determined by the configuration one time step in the past , and the lack of short loops in the random graph ensures that all information propagating from a given past light cone to a given future light cone must pass through the single node under consideration .",
    "[ fig : rbn ] illustrates the latter point . in a regular lattice",
    ", a node s past light cone can influence its future light cone through multiple paths , whereas in an rbn , the chance of finding such a path is vanishingly small in the limit of large system size .",
    "thus , even though the definition of statistical complexity relies on arbitrarily deep light cones , the results for depth 1 become exact for rbns with system size @xmath62 .",
    "this fact enables us to calculate @xmath0 and , in some cases , @xmath1 analytically in the large system limit .",

    "the networks we have studied have both types of inhomogeneity .",
    "we find that @xmath0 , obtained from statistics at a single time step , can be calculated analytically for rbn s , and that it is not simply related to sensitivity to small perturbations .",
    "the maximum of @xmath0 can occur in the ordered , disordered , or critical regime , depending on the details of the probability distribution chosen for the boolean rules in the network .",
    "@xmath0 is directly related to the steady state ( or long - term oscillatory ) bias in the node values .",
    "@xmath1 , obtained from statistics compiled over time for individual nodes , is zero ( in the large system limit ) everywhere in the ordered and at the limiting value of sensitivity in the disordered regime , so it is maximized somewhere in the disordered regime .",
    "the value at an individual node , @xmath59 , may be interpreted as a measure of the role that node in determining the global dynamics .",
    "nodes that can be replaced by random number generators without substantially altering the global dynamics ( and hence perform no essential information processing ) tend to have lower @xmath59 .",
    "this last finding may be helpful in characterizing the behavior of social or biological systems and the individual agents or components that comprise them .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath59 s depend on the global features of the network that determine its attractors , not just on the local logic functions and topology . in other words",
    ", the identification of important players in a network requires global information about the network , not just a characterization of each individual s behavior .                            c.  r. shalizi , optimal nonlinear prediction of random fields on networks , in _ discrete models for complex systems , dmcs03 _ , edited by m.  morvan and  .",
