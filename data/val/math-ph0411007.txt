    "the study of self - contact in elastic rods has seen some remarkable progress over the last ten years , with highlights such as the numerical work of tobias , coleman , and swigon  @xcite , the introduction of global curvature by gonzalez and co - workers  @xcite , and the derivation of the euler - lagrange equations for energy minimization by schuricht and von der mosel  @xcite .",
    "parallel advances have been made on the highly related ideal knots and gehring links , where ropelength is minimized instead of elastic energy  @xcite .    despite this progress important questions remain open .",
    "we are still far from understanding analytically the solutions of the euler - lagrange equations for general contact situations .",
    "even if we limit ourselves to global minimizers of an appropriate energy functional , we can prove little about the form of solutions as soon as contact is taken into account .",
    "for instance , a long - standing conjecture for closed elastic rods is that in the limit of long rods under constant twist the global energy minimizer should be a ply ( double helix ) with a loop on each end .",
    "if a structure of this type is assumed , then the limiting pitch angle can be determined  @xcite ; but the difficult part actually consists in showing that global minimizers have this structure . incidentally , since local minimizers of different type have been found numerically  @xcite , the restriction to global minimizers appears to be essential .",
    "this example is typical for the current state of understanding : if assumptions are made on the set of contacts , then characterizations are possible  @xcite , but for unrestrained geometry little is known rigorously .",
    "it shows how our lack of understanding of energy minimizers is intimately linked to the lack of knowledge about structure of the contact set .",
    "examples show that this structure can be non - trivial : for instance , non - contiguous contact appears at the end of a ply in an elastic rod  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study a problem of self - contact of an elastic rod in which the rod has reduced freedom of movement : the centerline of the rod is constrained to lie on the surface of a cylinder ( figure  [ fig : cylcoord ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the full three - dimensional problem referred to above , the reduced dimensionality of this problem enables us to give a near - complete characterization of global minimizers , without making any _ a priori _ assumptions on the structure of the contact set . notwithstanding this , determining the structure of the contact set is a central element of this paper .

    "the centerline of the rod is characterized by @xmath0 , which measures distance along the cylinder axis as a function of a tangential independent variable @xmath1 .",
    "the unknown in this minimization problem is the derivative @xmath7 , which may by thought of as the cotangent of the angle between the centerline tangent and the cylinder axis ; @xmath8 is zero when the rod curls around the cylinder orthogonal to the axis , and @xmath9 when the rod is parallel to the axis .",
    "this transformation is detailed in section  [ sec : derivation ] .",
    "the most interesting part of the variational problem is the transformed contact condition ( condition of non - self - penetration ) . in this paper",
    "we take the thickness of the rod to be zero ; then the non - self - penetration condition is @xmath10 where the interval @xmath11 $ ] corresponds to one full turn around the cylinder ; this condition formalizes the intuitive idea that non - self - penetration is equivalent to the condition ` that the rod remain on the same side of itself ' .",
    "this condition on @xmath8 makes the variational problem a non - local obstacle problem .",
    "non - zero thickness requires a contact condition that is substantially more involved than  ; we comment on this situation in section  [ subsec : thickness ] .",
    "both the background in rod theory and the independent mathematical context of this minimization problem raise questions about the solutions :    1 .",
    "do solutions exist ? 2 .",

    "what form do the contact forces take ? 6 .",
    "does the solution inherit the symmetry of the formulation ?",
    "this is the case for a symmetric rod on a cylinder without contact condition  @xcite , but need not be true when taking contact into account .",
    "in the rest of this paper we address these questions .",
    "the first main result of this investigation ( theorem  [ thm : minimizing_rods_intersect ] ) shows that the contact condition   is essential : without this condition the centerline of a rod will intersect itself .",
    "a little experiment with some string wrapped around a pencil will convince the reader that this is the case .",
    "we also prove the regularity result that a constrained minimizer  @xmath8 is of class @xmath15 , and we derive the euler - lagrange equation @xmath16 where the lagrange multiplier @xmath17 is a non - negative radon measure with support contained in the contact set @xmath14 ( theorem  [ thm : el - equations ] ) .    from stationarity alone , which is the basis of theorem  [ thm : el - equations ]",
    ", the characterization of @xmath17 as a positive radon measure appears to be optimal ; no further information can be extracted . in section  [ sec : interval ]",
    "we use two different additional assumptions to further characterize the contact set and subsequently the measure @xmath17 . in both cases",
    "we obtain the important result that the contact set is a ( possibly empty ) interval and that the measure @xmath17 is a sum of dirac delta functions , as represented schematically in figure  [ fig : fg ] .",
    "the weighting of the delta functions is shown in the middle of figure  [ fig : fg ] : there is a linear decrease or increase in weight from one side of the contact set to the other ( theorem  [ thm : structure_g_3 ] ) . since @xmath17 may be interpreted as the contact force , we deduce that    * the contact force is concentrated in at most two tangential positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and in integer translates of @xmath20 ; * the magnitude of the contact force is maximal at the contact point where the rod lifts off , and decreases linearly with each turn . figure  [ fig : typical ] graphically illustrates this behaviour .",
    "( 11,9 ) ( 5.5,7 )    ( 5.5,2.5 )    the decrease in contact force with each turn can be understood in the following way .",
    "the difference between the contact forces on either side of the rod creates a resulting force exerted on the rod , and the two resultant forces that act at @xmath21 point in opposite directions .",
    "if we imagine a single , closed ring with two forces acting on it in this way , the two forces create a moment that will bend the ring .",

    "the simple structure of the functional and the contact condition suggest that the methods and results of this paper might be applicable to other systems than this particular rod - on - cylinder model .",

    "the situation is simpler , since the freedom of movement is essentially two - dimensional  similar to that of a curve in a plane .",
