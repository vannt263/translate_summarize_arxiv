    "the broadcast channel has predominantly been studied in the context of unicast messaging , where the transmitter wishes to send one private message to each of the @xmath0 receivers ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "we refer to this as unicasting .",
    "the transmitter may however wish to send different messages to different subsets of receivers .",
    "we refer to this as multicasting .",
    "the most general multicast structure comprises of @xmath1 messages ( the powerset ) . for @xmath3",
    "there are three messages , one required only by the first receiver , one required only by the second receiver , and one required by both receivers .",
    "the multicast capacity region for a broadcast channel is the set of @xmath1-dimensional rate vectors that are achievable . for @xmath3",
    "this is the set of achievable rate vectors @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the rate of the common message .",
    "one question of interest is , can the multicast capacity region be inferred from the unicast capacity region ?",
    "that is , can we always compute the multicast capacity region from the unicast capacity region , i.e. without knowing the structure of the channel ? for certain broadcast channels this is true , although it is not true in general .",
    "thus the multicast capacity region provides additional information about the communication limits of the channel beyond that of the unicast capacity region .",
    "multicasting has received significant attention in the network - coding literature . in @xcite and @xcite the maximum rate at which a common message can be sent from a source node through a network of directed noiseless links to a collection of sink nodes ,",
    "is shown to equal the minimum - cut of the associated graph . in @xcite and @xcite the multicast capacity region for one - source - two - sink networks",
    "is fully characterized .",
    "it is again given by the minimum - cuts of the associated graph . for three or more",
    "sinks this is not the case and the problem is open . in this exposition",
    "we shed light on it by characterizing some of the structure for three - sink networks .",
    "there is an oddity to multicasting .",
    "suppose we have a two - user broadcast channel that can support a rate vector @xmath7 .",
    "that is the transmitter can simultaneously deliver one bit of private information to the first receiver , one bit of private information to the second receiver , and one bit of common information to both receivers .",
    "an important point to clarify is that there is _ no secrecy requirement _",
    "``private '' information sent to the first receiver may or may not be decodable by the second receiver and vice versa .",
    "then the channel can also support a rate vector @xmath8 .",
    "the transmitter merely uses the common bit to send private information to the first receiver .",
    "ofcourse the second receiver is capable of decoding this bit too , but the information is of no interest to it . by symmetry",
    "the achievability of rate vector @xmath7 also implies the achievability of rate vector @xmath9 .",
    "there is one more implication in this vein : the achievability of @xmath7 implies the achievability of @xmath10 .",
    "the reasoning is similar .",
    "the transmitter sends the same information on the two private bits . in this way the first user receives the same private bit as the second user , in addition to the same common bit .",
    "thus two common bits have been sent .",
    "these three manipulations are summarized in figure [ fig : bc_example ] as _ extremal rays _ stemming from @xmath7 and represent three distinct encoding / decoding operations that can always be performed , regardless of the structure of the broadcast channel . in this sense",
    "they are universal .",
    "by time - sharing one can achieve any point in the polytope indicated in figure [ fig : bc_example ] . to summarize : if a rate - vector @xmath7 is achievable , so must be the region illustrated , regardless of the channel .",
    "is this set of operations complete ? put in reverse , are there any rate vectors outside the polytope in figure [ fig : bc_example ] that are achievable on for all broadcast channels for which @xmath7 is achievable ?",
    "the answer is that there are not there exists a broadcast channel where the rate vector @xmath7 is achievable , but no rate vector outside the polytope in figure [ fig : bc_example ] is .",
    "thus for the two - user broadcast channels the three operations discussed form a complete set -they are the only _ distinct universal encoding / decoding operations_.    it is straightforward to generalize these operations to broadcast channels with an arbitrary number of users .",
    "consider for example the three user broadcast channel .",
    "there are seven messages .",
    "suppose a rate vector @xmath11 is achievable ( for example , @xmath12 represents the rate of the message intended for receivers 1 and 3 ) .",
    "then for any two subsets of receivers @xmath13 we can perform the operation @xmath14 , and for any two subsets of receivers @xmath15 we can perform the operation @xmath16 .",
    "for instance we may swap the first and second receivers private bits for a common bit that is sent to the pair , so that the rate vector @xmath17 is achieved .",
    "similarly the rate vector @xmath18 can be achieved by using the first receivers private bit and the bit common to the second and third receivers , to send information common to all three receivers .",
    "it can be shown that the number of distinct operations of this form is 15 .",
    "that is , if the rate vector @xmath19 is achievable , so is the set of points contained within a 15-edged polytope , which is the generalization to @xmath4 of the polytope in figure [ fig : bc_example ] .",
    "again we ask the question , is this set of operations complete ? are there any points outside this 15-edged polytope that are universally achievable on any three - user broadcast channel ?",
    "the answer , perhaps surprisingly , is yes",
    ". there exists a sixteenth distinct universal encoding / decoding operation .",
    "it does not involve a mere relabeling of common and private bits .",
    "it enables the rate vector @xmath20 to be achieved .",
    "this new operation together with the fifteen trivial ones forms the complete set of distinct universal encoding / decoding operations for @xmath4 .",
    "that is , all other rate vectors universally achievable from @xmath21 can be achieved by time sharing between these 16 distinct universal encoding / decoding operations .",
    "now we turn to the multiple access channel ( mac ) with @xmath0 users .",
    "the mac has also typically been studied in the context of unicast messaging where it s capacity region has in many cases been completely characterized . for multicasting the capacity of the discrete memoryless mac",
    "is computed in @xcite and a conjecture regarding the generalization of this result to an arbitrary number of users is given .",
    "let us apply the reasoning we applied above for the broadcast channel , to the mac .",
    "consider a two user mac .",
    "each transmitter wishes to send a private message of rate @xmath22 to the receiver for @xmath23 .",
    "in addition there is a common message of rate @xmath6 that both transmitters share , and desire to be sent to the receiver .",
    "suppose for a given mac a rate vector @xmath24 is achievable .",
    "then the first transmitter could just label its rate - one bit stream as common information and send it to the transmitter .",
    "thus the rate vector @xmath25 is also achievable .",
    "by symmetry the second transmitter could do the same so @xmath26 is achievable too .",
    "are there any other operations that tradeoff between elements of the rate vector ?",
    "is achievable but we will not be interested in this operation as it can be expressed as a linear combination of others . ]",
    "the answer is no . for the broadcast channel we could swap common information for private , but not so for the mac .",
    "more specifically we can not relabel common information as private , as a common bitstream may require both transmitters have access to it in order for it to be passed to the receiver .",
    "a private bitstream assumes only a single transmitter has access to it .",
    "the @xmath7-multicast region for the two - user mac is plotted in figure [ fig : mac_example ] .",
    "there are three extremal rays and correspondingly three distinct universal / encoding decoding operations .",
    "the first two are stated above and the third consists of merely lowering the common rate so as to arrive at the point @xmath27 .    unlike the broadcast channel , this structure directly generalizes to @xmath0 users . for three users",
    "there are ten universal encoding / decoding operations .",
    "six result from relabeling private information as pairwise .",
    "three result from relabeling pairwise as common and the last results from lowering the common rate .",
    "thus the multicast capacity region of the multiple access channel has a less intricate structure than that of the broadcast .    in this paper",
    "we characterize the complete set of distinct universal encoding / decoding operations and the associated region of achievable rate vectors , for both the broadcast channel and the mac channel , for @xmath4 .",
    "in essence this is a characterization of the universal constraints on the multicast capacity region of these channels .",

    "the symbol @xmath42 denotes element - wise inequality .",
    "consider a broadcast channel with three receivers . the input alphabet is denoted @xmath43 and the output alphabets @xmath44 .",
    "the probability transition function is @xmath45 .",

    "denote the rate vector @xmath48 .",
    "a @xmath49 code consists of an encoder @xmath50    and twelve decoders @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes the receiver and @xmath53 with @xmath54 denotes the message index .",
    "thus each receiver decodes four messages ( the first receiver decodes @xmath55 , etc ... ) .",
    "the probability of error @xmath56 is defined to be the probability that at least one of the decoded messages is not equal to the transmitted message , i.e. @xmath57    where the seven messages are assumed to be mutually independent and uniformly distributed over @xmath58 .",
    "a multicast rate vector @xmath59 is said to be achievable for the broadcast channel if there exists a sequence of @xmath49 codes with @xmath60 .",
