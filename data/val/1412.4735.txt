    "neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are evolutionarily linked , where msps are the end products of an episode of accretion of matter and angular momentum from the binary companion to the neutron star @xcite .",
    "recent observations of psr j1023@xmath20038 @xcite and psr j1824@xmath02452i @xcite have directly shown transitions from lmxb to msp states and vice versa .",
    "such systems in tight orbits ( @xmath7 1 day ) around main - sequence - like companions ( with typical mass 0.20.3 @xmath8 ) are called `` redbacks '' @xcite , similar to another class of eclipsing systems , called `` black - widows '' , containing msps that are ablating their very - low - mass ( @xmath9 ) companions .",
    "the discovery of more such lmxb  msp systems will help to determine whether they are on the way to becoming canonical msps with white dwarf companions , or whether they are a sub - class of msps that will continue to transition back - and - forth between the two states .",
    "psr j1023@xmath20038 was the first such system seen to transition from an lmxb to an eclipsing binary radio msp @xcite .",

    "the previous signs of an accretion disc ( i.e. double - peaked optical emission lines ) also disappeared .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations presented by @xcite showed a ( previously absent ) orbital modulation of the x - ray brightness which , in analogy to psr j1023@xmath20038 , is believed to come from an active pulsar wind shocking near the surface of the companion star @xcite .",

    "<S> xss j12270@xmath04859 is an x - ray binary associated with the _ fermi _ lat gamma - ray source 1fgl j1227.9@xmath04852 . in 2012 december , this source underwent a transition where the x - ray and optical luminosity dropped and the spectral signatures of an accretion disc disappeared . </S>",
    "<S> we report the discovery of a 1.69 millisecond pulsar ( msp ) , psr j1227@xmath04853 , at a dispersion measure of 43.4 pc @xmath1 associated with this source , using the gmrt at 607mhz . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that , post - transition , the system hosts an active radio msp . </S>",
    "<S> this is the third system after psr j1023@xmath20038 and psr j1824@xmath02452i showing evidence of state switching between radio msp and low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) states . </S>",
    "<S> we report timing observations of psr j1227@xmath04853 with the gmrt and parkes , which give a precise determination of the rotational and orbital parameters of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the companion mass measurement of 0.17 to 0.46 m@xmath3 suggests that this is a redback system . </S>",
    "<S> psr j1227@xmath04853 is eclipsed for about 40% of its orbit at 607mhz ; with additional short - duration eclipses at all orbital phases . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the pulsar is very energetic , with a spin - down luminosity of @xmath4 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we report simultaneous imaging and timing observations with the gmrt , which suggests that eclipses are caused by absorption , rather than dispersion smearing or scattering .    0.6 cm </S>"
