    "zirconium alloys are widely used as fuel cladding and structural materials in water cooled nuclear reactors . the principal role of the cladding is to provide a physical barrier between the fuel and the coolant thereby ensuring radionuclides remain contained within the fuel pin , while protecting the nuclear fuel from a strong flow of hot , potentially corrosive water or water / steam mix .    in the past four decades",
    "a number of compositional and processing changes have been made to improve the mechanical and corrosion resistance properties of zr alloys@xcite .",
    "concurrently with the increased durability and reliability of the cladding ( and structural elements of the reactor core ) the fuel burnup has also increased , leading to a reduction in energy production costs .",
    "one of the limiting factors for a further increase in fuel burnup is the hydrogen pick - up of zr alloys .",
    "the presence of h in the cladding is of concern for a variety of reasons including dimensional changes , reduced ductility of the metal , and the formation of hard , brittle hydrides , which in turn may increase corrosion rates or cause failure by delayed hydride cracking@xcite .",
    "new nuclear fuel cycle regulations that take into account hydrogen levels in the cladding are also being considered@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , essential to develop a deeper understanding of the processes responsible for the h pick - up , in order to deliver improved reactor performance , from both economic and safety standpoints .",
    "recent work@xcite has been carried out to investigate , from first principles , the structure , stability and mechanical properties of hydrides within the zr metal .",
    "the current work , instead , focuses on interaction between h and the second phase particles ( spps ) formed within the zr alloys .",
    "most alloying elements that are typically used in zr alloys have very limited solubility in @xmath0-zr , and therefore tend to precipitate as intermetallic spps@xcite .",
    "the main exceptions are sn , which exhibits solid solubility in @xmath0-zr at alloying concentrations of interest , and nb , which precipitates out as @xmath2-(zr , nb ) solid solution at operating temperature and below , as well as forming intermetallic spps in the presence of fe .",
    "further details are provided in section  [ sec : xtal ] .",
    "the interaction between the spps and h is not yet well understood .",
    "it remains unclear whether the spps act as traps for h , provide nucleation sites for hydrides , or whether they may act as a preferred transport path through the outer oxide layer for ingress of h into the metal@xcite .    in our previous work@xcite",
    "we employed atomic scale computer simulations , based on density functional theory ( dft ) , to investigate the solubility of h in zr intermetallics of particular importance for zircaloy-2 and zircaloy-4 alloys . here",
    ", the study is extended to other binary intermetallics of zr ( containing cu , fe , mo , ni , nb , sn and v ) , which are either directly relevant to fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors , or have been used in model alloys to understand the role spps play in controlling the h pick - up .",
    "all dft simulations were carried out using castep@xcite . the exchange and correlation functional employed was the generalized gradient approximation , as formulated by the perdew burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite .",
    "ultra - soft pseudo potentials with a consistent cut - off energy of were used throughout . a high density of * k*-points was employed for the integration of the brillouin zone , following the monkhost - pack sampling scheme@xcite : the distance between sampling points was maintained as close as possible to and never above . in practice",
    "this means a sampling grid of @xmath3 points for the largest intermetallic supercells .",
    "the fast fourier transform grid was set to be twice as dense as that of the wavefunctions , with a finer grid for augmentation charges scaled by 2.3 . due to the metallic nature of the system , density mixing and",
    "methfessel - paxton@xcite cold smearing of bands were employed with a width of .",
    "testing was carried out to ensure a convergence of was achieved with respect to all of the above parameters .",
    "no symmetry operations were enforced and all calculations were spin polarised , taking particular care in finding the lowest energy spin state of phases containing magnetic elements .",
    "the energy convergence criterion for self - consistent calculations was set to .",
    "similarly robust criteria were imposed for atomic relaxation : energy difference @xmath4  , forces on individual atoms @xmath4   and for constant pressure simulations stress component on cell @xmath4  .",
    "many different types of spps have been reported in the literature relating to zr alloys , often with little agreement on their chemical composition and crystal structure . in this section",
    "we report a summary of the possible spps that can form between zr and each of the alloying elements under investigation ( see table  [ tab : supercells ] ) .    .",
    "[ tab : supercells ] overview of all compounds investigated for the accommodation of h , together with the size of the largest supercell simulated in terms of the number of atoms ( @xmath5 ) and smallest distance between the h defect and its replicas ( @xmath6 ) . for laves phases ,",
    "m = cr , fe , mo , nb , v. [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the zrm@xmath1 phases , little variation in the accommodation of h was observed between the three laves structures @xmath7 , therefore the results from zrm@xmath1 simulations have been condensed into a single value for each element and the statistical error is reported .",
    "similarly , the three models of the zr@xmath8sn@xmath9 phase were reported as one .",
    "the exact values of @xmath10(h ) were @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ev for @xmath14 respectively .",
    "for the case of zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 , the lowest energy site was the only unoccupied @xmath16 wyckoff site .",
    "it is reasonable to expect a large number of unoccupied sn self - interstitial sites in this phase , therefore the defect energy was calculated as an interstitial defect into a phase with one unoccupied sn self - interstitial site , rather than the substitutional defect h@xmath17 in the fully occupied zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 structure .",
    "zr@xmath8sn@xmath9 , exhibits two preferred sites : the @xmath18 site between 3 zr atoms , and , directly above and below it , the @xmath16 site between 6 zr atoms .",
    "the relative preference for h of one site over the other changes as a function of sn content . at a content of three sn atoms per formula unit , the trigonal @xmath18 site is preferred ( against of the octahedral site ) . as the sn content increase to 3.5 , half of the @xmath16 sites",
    "are occupied by the excess sn .",
    "the presence of a sn atom in the @xmath16 site , causes a reduction in space in the neighbouring @xmath18 sites , while only marginally affecting the configuration of other ( unoccupied ) @xmath16 sites in the cell .",
    "this is reflected in the solution of h in the two sites : the @xmath18 site becomes significantly less favourable ( ) , while the @xmath16 provides a similar solution enthalpy as in the previous case ( ) . in the case of zr@xmath8sn@xmath15 all of the @xmath16 sites are occupied , consequently the @xmath18 sites are compressed by two sn atoms , one above and one below , reducing the volume available for accommodation of h even further , and the enthalpy associated with accommodating an h atom in that site becomes positive and large ( ) .",
    "the current work shows that @xmath2-zr accommodates h more readily than @xmath0-zr ( in agreement with experimental data@xcite ) , and that @xmath2-nb exhibits the same value of @xmath10(h ) as @xmath0-zr .",
    "this suggests that , if the @xmath2-(nb , zr ) solid solution found in binary zr - nb alloys behaves similarly to its two end members , those alloys do not contain any strong sinks for h. nevertheless , the formation of metastable zrnb@xmath1 phases may affect this , as discussed below .    regarding the zrm@xmath1 laves phases ,",
    "the solution enthalpy of h generally decreases with increasing number of @xmath6 electrons in the transition metal m : from highest to lowest affinity nb , v , cr , mo and fe .",
    "the same trend has been observed with respect to h solution capacity@xcite . whilst h does not prefer to dissolve in the laves phases containing the latter three elements",
    "( i.e. cr , mo , and fe ) compared to @xmath0-zr , the intermetallics formed with either nb or v offer favourable sites for the accommodation of h. this suggests that if these binary spps are present in the cladding , h will likely segregate to them , which may deplete the h content in the zirconium metal .",
    "the beneficial effect of the h sinks may , however , be limited to the initial stages of the fuel cycle . at higher burnups ,",
    "the intermetallic particles are likely to dissolve@xcite , amorphise or oxidise , thereby releasing any stored h. in addition to zrnb@xmath1 and zrv@xmath1 , all zr - rich phases provided lower @xmath10(h ) values compared to @xmath0-zr .",
    "furthermore , for each element where more than one stoichiometric phase is present ( cu , fe , ni and sn ) , those with the largest zr / m ratio provided the lowest solution enthalpy for h ( see figure  [ fig : h_sol - m_content ] ) .",
    "zr is known to exhibit higher affinity for h compared to cu , fe and ni ( see the extremes of figure  [ fig : h_sol - m_content ] ) , therefore a decrease in enthalpy of solution with increasing zr content is expected . however , from a volumetric standpoint , intermetallic phases have a lower packing fraction compared to the pure metals , offering a larger number of interstitial sites with varying amounts of space .",
    "for this reason intermetallic phases are expected to exhibit lower defect volumes ( and associated strain fields ) when accommodating an h interstice . as a result of the two competing processes",
    " chemical bonding and volumetric effects  the lowest solution enthalpies are found , as mentioned above , for zr - rich intermetallic phases that provide interstitial sites with 4-fold zr - coordination .    unlike other alloying additions ,",
    "fe forms a wide range of intermetallic compounds , and their relative stability is greatly affected by other alloying elements : zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) spps are commonly observed in the absence of cr additions , while in cr - containing alloys , zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 laves phases become the dominant spps@xcite . in the presence of nb , hexagonal zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 laves phases and cubic ( zr , nb)@xmath1fe phases have been reported@xcite .",
    "similarly , the few records of sn - zr spps also report some fe solubility into these particles@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the addition of fe does not influence which intermetallic phases form , rather it will go into solution in all or most of the spps present . assuming that a ternary phase behaves similarly to its binary end members , solution of fe in zrm@xmath1 laves phases and zr@xmath1x phases , is expected to reduce their affinity to h , since zrfe@xmath1 and zr@xmath1fe exhibit less favourable @xmath19 compared to all other phases with the same stoichiometry and structure .",
    "the opposite can be said for the zr@xmath20fe - type spps .",
    "owing to the fact that both zrcr@xmath1 and zrfe@xmath1 have unfavourable @xmath19 values , it is predicted that the ternary zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 phase , found predominantly in zircaloy-4 , does not getter h from the surrounding @xmath0-zr . as for the zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) , which is the predominant spp in zircaloy-2 , both of its binary end members offer favourable solution enthalpies for h. nonetheless",
    ", the difference in affinity to h with respect to @xmath0-zr is rather small ( on the order of ) , and is expected to diminish with increasing fe content .",
    "such small differences in energy may easily be overcome by thermal and entropic effects , consequently zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) are not expected to be strong sinks for h in solution . whilst it is possible to speculate on the behaviour of ternary phases where both binary end members have either positive or negative @xmath19 values , it is much harder to predict the h affinity of other ternary spps such as zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 found in zirlo alloys .",
    "it is possible , however , to expect that the behaviour of such spps is strongly correlated to their chemical composition , and more specifically the nb / fe ratio of the intermetallic particle .",
    "if @xmath21 then the spps may act as h sinks , whilst with a composition of @xmath22 they are not likely to accommodate any h.    under irradiation , fe has been reported to diffuse out of the spps faster than other elements@xcite . in the case of laves phases , and",
    "especially nb - containing laves phases , the current work suggests that this would increase the affinity of the residual spp for h. however , concomitantly to the dissolution of fe , the spps are reported to undergo amorphisation and at present it is impossible to predict how this will affect the interaction between h and the spp .",
    "dft simulations have been employed to calculate the enthalpy of solution of h in pure zr , nb and in intermetallic phases of zr .",
    "pure @xmath2-zr exhibits more favourable solution enthalpy for h relative to @xmath0-zr , however the difference is predicted to diminish in the presence of nb . regarding the laves spps , the presence of nb or v is predicted to increase the affinity with h , whilst the presence of cr , mo and fe will reduce it .",
    "cu , ni and sn additions may form a number of binary intermetallic phases , but tend to stabilise as zr - rich phases .",
    "all zr - rich phases , namely zr@xmath20fe , zr@xmath1ni , zr@xmath1cu and zr@xmath20sn , provide lower energy sites for h accommodation , compared to @xmath0-zr , suggesting that their presence in the alloy could provide sinks for h.    with regards to the more commonly observed ternary spps , it is predicted that zr@xmath1(fe , ni ) ( found mainly in zircaloy-2 ) and @xmath2-(zr , nb ) precipitates ( present in all nb containing alloys ) exhibit an affinity to h similar to that of @xmath0-zr , and are therefore not expected to strongly getter h from their surroundings .",
    "zr(cr , fe)@xmath1 spps found in zircaloy-4 are predicted to have very unfavourable solution enthalpies for h and therefore not to accommodate any h. the affinity to h of the zr(nb , fe)@xmath1 spps , present in zirlo alloys , is expected to vary strongly with nb / fe ratio : high nb content spps are expected to trap h , whilst high fe content spps will reject it .",
