    "the process of inverse bremsstrahlung has received attention from time to time over the last three decades , in various astrophysical settings .",
    "inverse bremsstrahlung is defined here to be the emission of a single photon when a high speed ion collides with an electron that is effectively at rest , and has often been referred to as suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung ( e.g. boldt & serlemitsos 1969 ; brown 1970 ; jones 1971 ; haug 1972 ) .",
    "being a kinematic inverse ( an analogy can be drawn with inverse compton scattering ) arising purely via lorentz transformations between reference frames ( i.e. it is still the electron that radiates ) , it is not to be confused with the true quantum electrodynamical inverse of conventional bremsstrahlung , namely the absorption of photons in 3-body collisions with electrons and ions , a process that is highly improbable in tenuous ( i.e. optically thin ) astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the first application of suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung in astrophysical models dates to the work of hayakawa & matsuoka ( 1964 ) , which considered such radiation in collisions between cosmic rays and ambient electrons in the intergalactic medium as a source of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) at energies kev .",
    "this concept was developed in the papers by hayakawa ( 1969 ) , boldt & serlemitsos ( 1969 ) , and brown ( 1970 ) , with boldt & serlemitsos proposing that suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung could account for the flat spectral index of the xrb below around 15 kev , while noting that an unusually high column density of ambient electrons would be required to match the observed flux .",
    "the interest in the relevance of inverse bremsstrahlung to the cosmic xrb has since diminished , and more recent opinion favours the accumulation of unresolved discrete sources as the dominant contributions ( see fabian & barcons 1992 , for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "although thermal bremsstrahlung at around 40 kev can fit the 2100 kev spectrum fairly well ( marshall , et al .",
    "1980 ; see also boldt 1987 , for a review ) , recent critical evidence limits the contribution of truly diffuse emission from the intergalactic medium to less than 0.01% of the observed flux .",
    "this bound is derived from upper limits to the mean cosmological electron density obtained from the measurements of cobe to compton scattering - induced distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( wright , et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "renewed interest in inverse bremsstrahlung has arisen in the last year .",
    "tatischeff , ramaty & kozlovsky ( 1998 ) and dogiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have discussed expectations for suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung in the x - ray band , assuming a significant enhancement of the density of low energy cosmic ray ions in the orion region .",
    "inferences of such an abundance of ions were drawn from the reported ( e.g. bloemen et al .",
    "1994 ) , but recently retracted ( bloemen et al .",
    "1999 ) , detection with comptel / cgro of emission lines from the orion molecular cloud complex ; these were attributed to carbon and oxygen nuclear line emission in collisions with ambient ions . in a different context , valinia and marshall ( 1998 )",
    "conjectured that inverse bremsstrahlung from cosmic rays could be responsible for much of the diffuse x - ray emission seen in the galactic ridge .",
    "pohl ( 1998 ) has responded to this proposition by arguing that it is difficult to produce the diffuse component in the ridge via inverse bremsstrahlung without violating observational limits to nuclear excitation line and pion decay continuum emission .",
    "furthermore , tatischeff , ramaty & valinia ( 1999 ) argue that by normalizing the low energy cosmic ray ion populations using the galactic be production rate , the contribution of inverse bremsstrahlung to the thin disk component of unresolved / diffuse 10 - 60 kev emission detected by rxte is at most a few percent .",
    "the focus of the presentation here is on collisionless shocked astrophysical plasmas , which distinguish themselves from the diffuse emission scenarios addressed by valinia and marshall ( 1998 ) , pohl ( 1998 ) and tatischeff , ramaty & valinia ( 1999 ) by the insignificance of coulomb collisions compared to interactions between the magnetic field and charged particles .",
    "the principal examples in mind here are young supernova remnants , i.e. those perhaps mature enough to be in the sedov epoch , but well before the radiative phase .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission properties of shocked environments are dictated by the dissipation between ions and electrons in the shock layer .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : ibveb ] that only when electron and ion thermal speeds are comparable ( i.e. , when the temperature ratio is on the order of , or less than the mass ratio , ) can inverse bremsstrahlung contribute significantly relative to normal electron bremsstrahlung in the optical , x - ray and gamma - ray wavebands .",
    "we argue in subsection  [ sec : expect ] that such conditions are not easily realized in the majority of _ shocked _ astrophysical environments , thereby rendering suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung unimportant for most discrete sources . by extension ,",
    "the importance of inverse bremsstrahlung as a continuum emission mechanism in extended regions is contingent upon there being a relative paucity of primary cosmic ray electrons in the interstellar medium on appropriate length scales ( pc ) .",
    "this point , and the role of knock - on electron bremsstrahlung , are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the key question of interest to astrophysicists that we address here is when the inverse bremsstrahlung process is significant relative to the normal bremsstrahlung mechanism in shocked astrophysical plasmas .",
    "clearly , the relative numbers of projectile and target particles will be central to answering this question . here",
    "we aim to determine how such numbers and the associated emissivities for the two processes depend on standard plasma parameters .",
    "the emissivities , or photon production rates for either process , can be written in the form @xmath0 for shock - accelerated cosmic ray ( projectile ) particles with momentum distribution colliding with targets of density that are effectively at rest in the observer s frame .",
    "here is the cross - section , differential in the photon energy , where we adopt the convention of using dimensionless units throughout this paper : photon energies are expressed in units of the electron rest mass , i.e. , via . hence has c.g.s .",
    "units of @xmath1 . also , is the speed of the projectile of momentum .",
    "the distribution functions of accelerated particles in shock environs need to be described numerically , in general , as will be evident from the monte carlo - generated distributions illustrated later in the paper .",
    "however , we can provide a good estimate of the relative importance of inverse bremsstrahlung and classical bremsstrahlung using simple but representative analytic forms for the particle distribution functions .",
    "for these purposes , let us approximate the cosmic ray ( shock - accelerated ) proton and electron distributions in a discrete source by power - laws in momentum , broken at thermal energies . defining and to be the proton and electron thermal speeds , respectively , their momentum distributions can be cast in the approximate form @xmath2 where is the thermal ( non - relativistic ) momentum for species ( ) . here , represents the total density and is the power - law index of a given _ projectile _ species .",
    "this discontinuous `` schematic '' form is chosen to mimic the _ slopes _ of the low momentum portion of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution and the non - thermal suprathermal portion of the cosmic ray distribution , and hence does not accurately describe the spectral structure near the thermal peak .",
    "consideration of such spectral details , which depend on the nature of dissipation in the shock layer , would introduce only modest corrections to the rates derived below , and are immaterial to the qualitative conclusions of this paper .",
    "the factor is introduced to account for the fact that the non - thermal tail does not extrapolate directly from the thermal peak in shock acceleration - generated populations , and its values define the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism , which can be a strong function of the field obliquity ( e.g. baring , ellison & jones 1993 ) and the strength of particle scattering ( e.g. ellison , baring & jones 1996 ) in the shock environs . for ions , acceleration is generally quite efficient , implying . for electrons ,",
    "the situation is less clear , pertaining to the well - known electron injection problem in non - relativistic shocks .",
    "however , as will be mentioned in subsection  [ sec : expect ] below , the observed electron - to - proton cosmic ray abundance ratio provides a canonical lower bound to the injection efficiency of electrons , and generally implies that can not be dramatically less than . finally , note that the target density of cool particles for the two processes in question will be written as , and will represent a subset of either of the accelerated populations that are formed from the shock heating of the interstellar medium .",
    "the ratio of inverse bremsstrahlung to bremsstrahlung emission in the optical to x - ray and soft gamma - ray bands can be quickly written down without the encumbrance of the mathematical complexity of the differential cross - sections involved .",
    "here we enunciate this , the principal result of the paper in a simple and enlightening manner , so that the detailed expositions of the next two subsections can be bypassed by the reader , if desired . at energies below around a few hundred kev ,",
    "the waveband of interest to the discussions of boldt & serlemitsos ( 1969 ) , hayakawa ( 1969 ) , brown ( 1970 ) , tatischeff , ramaty & kozlovsky ( 1998 ) , dogiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and valinia and marshall ( 1998 ) , the non - relativistic differential cross - section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : csect_nr ] ) below is operable , and applies to both bremsstrahlung and inverse bremsstrahlung .",
    "this cross - section is a function only of the speed of the ballistic particle involved , for a given photon energy .",
    "hence , any disparity in the emissivities for the two processes can only be due to differences in the numbers of ballistic protons and electrons at a given speed , a property that does not extend to relativistic domains .",
    "since bremsstrahlung x - rays in supernova remnant shocks are generally produced by slightly superthermal electrons , this number is just , reflecting the efficiency of injection into the shock acceleration process . for protons ,",
    "whose thermal speeds are much lower , only a small fraction can participate in inverse bremsstrahlung collisions with shocked electrons , namely those with speeds exceeding the electron thermal speed . using the suprathermal portion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : crdists ] ) , this constitutes a `` density '' , so that it immediately follows that the ratio of the two processes is of the order of @xmath3 for , as required by charge neutrality .",
    "therein lies the principal result , borne out in the derivations of the next two subsections , which are expounded because of their usefulness in astrophysical problems .",
    "clearly , the ratio depends principally on the degree of temperature equilibration , or otherwise , in the shocked plasma .",
    "a more - detailed estimate of the relative importance of inverse bremsstrahlung and classical bremsstrahlung at optical to x - ray energies can be obtained by considering only non - relativistic accelerated ions , i.e. those with . in this regime",
    ", the differential cross - section for either bremsstrahlung or its inverse can be obtained from textbooks such as jauch and rohrlich ( 1980 ) , and is the non - relativistic specialization of the bethe - heitler formula : @xmath4 where is the fine structure constant , is the nuclear charge , and is the classical electron radius .",
    "here is the relative speed ( in units of ) between the projectile and target , namely the electron speed for classical bremsstrahlung , and the proton ( or ion ) speed for the inverse process .",
    "the applicability of this formula , which is integrated over final electron and photon angles , for both bremsstrahlung and its inverse follows from the lorentz invariance of the total cross - section and the effective invariance of photon angles and energies in non - relativistic transformations between the proton and electron rest frames . with this interpretation , represents the final electron speed in the proton rest frame for either process .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : csect_nr ] ) is derived in the born or plane - wave approximation , and is strictly not applicable to regimes where or where coulomb perturbations to the electron wave - functions become important ( see the end of this section ) .",
    "appropriate results for low frequencies and classical regimes can be found in gould ( 1970 ) , and references therein , and amount to modifications of the argument of the logarithm .    using equation  ( [ eq : prodrate ] ) , it is straightforward to write down production rates of photons for the two processes in the limit of non - relativistic projectile speeds . for regular bremsstrahlung , the vast majority of shock - accelerated protons are effectively cold due to their generally low thermal speed ( except for unusually hot proton components in tenuous plasmas ) , so that the proton density represents the target density .",
    "hence the photon production rate is @xmath5 where is the electron power - law spectral index , and @xmath6 for @xmath7 here we use the argument to represent either or , as the case may be , in the work below .",
    "the first integral in equation  ( [ eq : fdef ] ) specializes to in the limit of .",
    "the second integral in equation  ( [ eq : fdef ] ) is generally expressible in terms of hypergeometric functions , though such a manipulation is not enlightening .",
    "specialization to the limit yields tractable integrals and the result .",
    "however , remembering that modest corrections to the cross - section in equation  ( [ eq : csect_nr ] ) are required ( gould 1970 ) in this low frequency limit , we restrict use of this specialization to the range .",
    "the other interesting limit is when , for which only the second integral contributes ; the result in this case is , where is the beta function .",
    "the substitutions , and identity 3.512.1 in gradshteyn and ryzhik ( 1980 ) facilitate these developments .",
    "the limiting cases can then be summarized as @xmath8 where is the gamma function , and @xmath9 defines the fundamental scale for the bremsstrahlung emissivity ( i.e. at and ) .",
    "the behaviour at low energies reflects the convolution of the bremsstrahlung infra - red divergence with a distribution possessing a finite number of particles .",
    "the dependence above electron thermal energies arises because the bremsstrahlung flux spectrum traces the electron _ energy _ distribution .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : nrbrems_lim ] ) is strictly valid only when , which will always be the case for convergent electron distributions . a simplified derivation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nrbrems_lim ] ) is presented in the appendix .",
    "the inverse bremsstrahlung spectrum can be evaluated in a similar manner , but noting that zero contribution arises whenever the proton speed drops below the electron thermal speed ; such a domain of phase space corresponds to normal bremsstrahlung .",
    "hence , thermal protons are never sampled unless the proton thermal speed is comparable to that of the electrons .",
    "it follows that the emissivity resembles the form in equation  ( [ eq : nrbrems ] ) with just an -type term ; extracting the appropriate power - law factor , the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity can be written @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the proton power - law index .",
    "the limiting forms of the function are just as for the bremsstrahlung case , so that we quickly arrive at the limits @xmath12 the two photon ranges of interest here , namely and , are the same as those for bremsstrahlung .",
    "this is due in part to the fact that only protons with speeds above electron thermal speeds will participate in inverse bremsstrahlung interactions .",
    "note that relaxing the requirement to bounds on greater than would introduce the appropriate numerical factor in equation  ( [ eq : nrinvbrems_lim ] ) .",
    "clearly , the factor roughly defines the ratio of inverse bremsstrahlung to bremsstrahlung emissivities ; expectations for its value in shocked plasmas will form the center of the discussion in section  [ sec : expect ] below .",
    "it is salient to remark at this point that the differential cross - section in equation  ( [ eq : csect_nr ] ) that we are using ( and also the ultra - relativistic limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : csect_er ] ) below of the bethe - heitler result ) was obtained from qed calculations in the born approximation . at",
    "non - relativistic speeds , the coulomb potential of the target electron or ion perturbs the projectile electron wave - function sufficiently that the plane - wave approximation breaks down .",
    "this occurs when drops below , where is the momentum of the energetic electron .",
    "here is the spatial scale appropriate to the interaction , which is the classical electron radius .",
    "hence , so - called coulomb corrections become necessary when . in such cases , the matrix element for scattering must be determined using coulomb wave functions .",
    "this has been done exactly for non - relativistic electrons colliding with nuclei by sommerfeld ( 1931 ) , leading to the application of a simple corrective multiplicative factor ( elwert 1939 ) @xmath13 } {            1-\\exp\\bigl [ -2\\pi\\fsc z/\\beta ' \\bigr ] }     \\quad , \\quad \\beta'=\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - 2\\omega}\\;\\ ; ,   \\label{eq : secorr}\\ ] ] known as the sommerfeld - elwert factor , to the bethe - heitler cross - section : @xmath14 here is the electron s speed ( in units of ) in the nuclear rest frame after collision , and is the charge number of the nucleus .",
    "note that a similar factor can be employed for electron - electron collisions ( maxon and corman 1967 , see also haug 1975 ) .",
    "such factors become important for projectile electron speeds below around ( for proton targets ) .",
    "when , the coulomb correction factor is simply , and it propagates through all the integrands of the above developments .",
    "it is then quickly ascertained that in the limiting cases , the correction factor is close to unity and therefore can be neglected ( modest low frequency corrections for are discussed in gould 1970 ) . for higher photon energies , the coulomb corrections",
    "should be included , with the appropriate modification to the algebraic manipulations .",
    "while the resulting integral is not tractable except in terms of higher order hypergeometric functions , we determined numerically that the corrective factor that should be applied to the cases in equations  ( [ eq : nrbrems_lim ] ) and  ( [ eq : nrinvbrems_lim ] ) increases monotonically from 1.17 to 1.94 as or vary between 1 to 5 , the representative range of power - law distribution indices .",
    "since such factors are of the order of unity , we can assert that coulomb correction factors are only marginally important for bremsstrahlung computations , and will prove immaterial to the considerations and conclusions of this paper ; we neglect them in the algebraic expressions hereafter .",
    "hard x - rays and gamma - rays from bremsstrahlung and inverse bremsstrahlung are generated by ultra - relativistic electrons and ions . in this regime",
    ", a single cross - section can not be used for the two mechanisms due to the introduction of aberrations in photon angles and modifications of energies in transforming between the two rest frames of the interacting particles . for normal bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the differential cross - section is the ultra - relativistic specialization of the bethe - heitler formula ( e.g. see jauch and rohrlich 1980 ) , obtained in the born approximation : @xmath15 and is not subject to significant coulomb corrections . here , is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "this formula can be used to compute contributions to the bremsstrahlung spectrum from mildly relativistic energies upwards .",
    "the review paper of blumenthal and gould ( 1970 ) provides a useful and enlightening discussion of various features and issues of bremsstrahlung from ultra - relativistic particles . from equation  ( [ eq : crdists ] ) , assuming a non - relativistic thermal speed for a species , the lorentz factor distribution is easily deduced to be @xmath16 this can be readily folded with the differential cross - section in equation  ( [ eq : csect_er ] ) via an adaption of equation  ( [ eq : prodrate ] ) to yield an emissivity appropriate to the gamma - ray band : @xmath17 where is given by equation  ( [ eq : lambdadef ] ) , and @xmath18 - \\dover{1}{2 } \\bigr ]   \\nonumber\\\\     & = &     \\dover{3\\alpha^2+\\alpha + 4}{3(\\alpha+1)\\alpha ( \\alpha -1)}\\ ;     \\bigl [ \\log_e 2\\omega - \\dover{1}{2 } - { \\cal c } \\bigr ]     + \\dover{3\\alpha^4 + 2\\alpha^3 + 15\\alpha^2 - 4 } {              3(\\alpha+1)^2\\alpha^2 ( \\alpha -1)^2 }   \\label{eq : kappadef } \\\\     & & - \\biggl ( \\dover{4}{3 } \\dover{\\psi ( \\alpha -1)}{\\alpha -1 }              - \\dover{4}{3 } \\dover{\\psi ( \\alpha ) } { \\alpha }              + \\dover{\\psi ( \\alpha + 1)}{\\alpha + 1 } \\biggr)\\;\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function , and is euler s constant .",
    "the evaluation of the integral is facilitated by identity 4.253.6 of gradshteyn and ryzhik ( 1980 ) .",
    "the values of equations  ( [ eq : nrbrems_lim ] ) and  ( [ eq : erbrems_lim ] ) are clearly of comparable magnitude .",
    "note also that the bremsstrahlung emissivity traces the electron energy distribution in the relativistic limit .",
    "a simple derivation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : erbrems_lim ] ) is provided in the appendix .",
    "determining the emissivity for inverse bremsstrahlung in the limit of ultra - relativistic ions is , in principal , more involved , largely because there are no published expressions for the differential cross - section , integrated over the various interaction angles , that are general enough to take the place of the bethe - heitler formula .",
    "exact numerical computations in the born approximation are presented by haug ( 1972 ) .",
    "simple analytic formulae for the cross - section were obtained by jones ( 1971 ) , who used the well - known weizscker - williams method ( weizscker 1934 ; williams 1935 ) where the process is treated as stationary electrons compton scattering the virtual photons carried by the proton s electromagnetic field .",
    "such a technique is quite applicable to hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray energies , but becomes erroneous when since then the approximation of the coulomb potential of the proton by a fourier decomposition into plane waves ( i.e. mimicking free photons ) breaks down .",
    "notwithstanding , the approximate formulae of jones ( 1971 ) suffice for the purposes of this analysis ( as will become evident shortly ) ; the limit of his equation  ( 4 ) is @xmath19 where we have included an extra factor of to include consideration of ions other than protons . at photon energies , the numerical computations in haug ( 1972 ) indicate that the differential cross - section approximates a power - law ( exceeding the analytic approximation of jones 1971 ) , before rolling over near the kinematic maximum energy of . equation  ( [ eq : dsigibww ] ) is readily integrated over the power - law lorentz factor distribution for ions that can be obtained from equation  ( [ eq : crdists_er ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 this approximation to the contribution to the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity from relativistic ions is still correct , up to a factor of order unity , when , and hence the specification of the range in equation  ( [ eq : erinvbrems_lim ] ) .",
    "when , the spectrum breaks to assume a form , so that the inverse bremsstrahlung spectrum is steeper than its bremsstrahlung counterpart by an index of roughly unity .",
    "we note that while the emissivity in equation  ( [ eq : erinvbrems_lim ] ) can formally exceed that in equation  ( [ eq : nrinvbrems_lim ] ) , in practice this never arises due to the distribution index exceeding 2 considerably at near - thermal energies , while at relativistic energies .",
    "hence , equation  ( [ eq : nrinvbrems_lim ] ) should be regarded as the appropriate form for optical and x - ray energies .",
    "a comparison of equations  ( [ eq : erbrems_lim ] ) and  ( [ eq : erinvbrems_lim ] ) again yields the result that the factor roughly defines the ratio of inverse bremsstrahlung to bremsstrahlung emissivities at soft gamma - ray energies .",
    "it is also pertinent to briefly mention electron - electron bremsstrahlung .",
    "since this process is a quadrupole interaction in a classical description , it is strongly suppressed for non - relativistic impact speeds relative to electron - ion bremsstrahlung .",
    "this is borne out in the differential cross - sections derived by fedyushin ( 1952 ) and garibyan ( 1953 ) , which are of the order of ( see , for example , the exposition in the appendix of baring et al .",
    "1999 ) , a factor of smaller than the result in equation  ( [ eq : csect_nr ] ) .",
    "however , the bremsstrahlung cross - section for ultra - relativistic impact speeds is necessarily comparable to that for bremsstrahlung ( i.e. equation  [ [ eq : csect_er ] ] ) , as is indicated in the work of baier , fadin & khoze ( 1967 ; see also the appendix of baring et al .",
    "1999 , and the discussion in blumenthal & gould 1970 ) , who derived limiting forms using the weizscker - williams method .",
    "the similarity of cross - sections for implies that the ratio of electron - electron bremsstrahlung to electron - proton bremsstrahlung is of the order of unity for plasmas with fairly normal ionic abundances , a fact that was noted by baring et al .",
    "hence , bremsstrahlung can play an influential role in the determination of the importance of inverse bremsstrahlung .      collecting all the rates",
    "so far assembled , it is now a simple enterprise to assert when inverse bremsstrahlung is significant in astrophysical scenarios . setting to be the ratio of equations  ( [ eq : nrinvbrems_lim ] ) to  ( [ eq : nrbrems_lim ] ) at , so as to represent the ratio of inverse bremsstrahlung to bremsstrahlung at optical to x - ray energies , and to be the ratio of equations  ( [ eq : erinvbrems_lim ] ) to  ( [ eq : erbrems_lim ] ) at , representing the inverse bremsstrahlung / bremsstrahlung ratio at soft gamma - ray energies , we arrive at @xmath22 expressing the thermal speeds of the two species in terms of the electron and proton temperatures and .",
    "similar order - of - magnitude estimates for such ratios can be obtained for other ionic species such as he@xmath23 . in equation  ( [ eq : ratios ] ) , it must be emphasized that for the optical / x - ray band ratio , the index refers to _ the mean index ranging from thermal proton speeds up to thermal electron ones _ , while for , represents the mean index of protons with .",
    "hence , given the general upward curvature of spectra for cosmic rays accelerated in non - linear shocks ( e.g. eichler 1984 ; jones & ellison , 1991 ) , we expect for the optical / x - ray band considerations and for the gamma - ray band . since the _ gamma - ray _",
    "spectrum for inverse bremsstrahlung ( see the discussion after equation  [ [ eq : erinvbrems_lim ] ] ) is steeper than that for bremsstrahlung in equation  ( [ eq : erbrems_lim ] ) , defines an upper bound to the ratio of emissivities for the two processes in hard gamma - rays , a bound that is actually conservative given the expectation that bremsstrahlung will amplify the bremsstrahlung signal by a factor of order 2 in the gamma - ray band .    the ratio of efficiency factors is a free parameter for a shock acceleration model . as noted at the beginning of section  [ sec : ibveb ] ,",
    "while efficient acceleration of protons is generally expected due to strong turbulence local to the shock ( e.g. ellison , baring & jones 1996 ) , so that , to order of magnitude ( which is borne out in observations of interplanetary shocks : see baring et al . 1997 ) , much less is known about the value of , essentially due to a paucity of _ in situ _ observations of electron acceleration in the heliosphere .",
    "however , this difficulty can be circumvented in part ( at least in astrophysical scenarios ) by arguing that cosmic ray data are a strong indicator of the acceleration efficiency in typical cosmic ray sources , principally supernova remnant shocks .",
    "the electron - to - proton abundance ratio above 1 gev ( where both species are relativistic ) is well - known to be of the order of a few percent ( e.g. see mller et al .",
    "1995 ) , which constrains the typical acceleration efficiency , assuming that differences in electron and proton propagation in the interstellar magnetic field at these energies are not great . from the forms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crdists ] ) , this ratio can be estimated as a function of the temperatures , masses and spectral indices of the two species . for an isothermal plasma with",
    ", one quickly determines that , so that the observed abundance ratio at momenta 1 gev / c is reproduced only if is of the same order of magnitude as , i.e. injection of electrons into the fermi mechanism is indeed efficient . relaxing the isothermal and equal index stipulations yields a range of on either side of unity . as will be apparent in the subsequent subsection , a specific simulation of the acceleration mechanism applied to supernova remnants yields values of not too disparate from unity .",
    "the temperature ratio clearly controls the importance of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to bremsstrahlung , both through its explicit appearance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratios ] ) , and also via its influence on the efficiency ratio . in shocked plasmas ,",
    "this ratio is expected to far exceed , thereby implying that _ inverse bremsstrahlung is insignificant in most astrophysical scenarios involving shocked plasmas_. this is the principal result of this paper ; it is contingent upon there being far fewer protons than electrons above electron thermal speeds , an occurrence we believe to be common near astrophysical shocks .",
    "evidence for this can be derived from both observational and theoretical sources . on the observational side",
    ", there is a clear indication of the lack of velocity equipartition in electron and proton populations near the earth s bow shock .",
    "feldman ( 1985 ) exhibits measurements of electron and ion velocity distributions that lead to the identification of ( i ) strong electron heating during shock passage , and ( ii ) downstream velocity thermal ratios for electrons to ions ( mostly protons ) of the order of 50 ( i.e. ) .",
    "the situation for travelling interplanetary shocks is similar . while ion distributions indicate shock heating that couples to the ram pressure differential across such weak shocks ( e.g. see baring et al .",
    "1997 for ulysses swics data , where k ) , measurements of electron populations are generally sparse .",
    "temperatures of the electron component of the solar wind upstream of interplanetary shocks is typically in the k range ( hoang et al .",
    "1995 ) , commensurate with large scale solar wind averages ( phillips , et al .",
    "1995 ) , and therefore are a sizeable fraction of the downstream ion velocity dispersion temperatures in the ulysses data set .",
    "hence , in the absence of any electron heating at the low mach number interplanetary shocks encountered by ulysses , will be obtained .",
    "such values are evinced in the isee data presented in feldman ( 1985 ) , which exhibits only modest heating of electrons by interplanetary shocks .    outside the heliosphere ,",
    "the evidence for significant electron heating is sparse and more circumstantial .",
    "shocks at the outer shells of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) provide the best indication .",
    "these move typically at speeds 5003000 km / sec , depending on the snr age and the mass of the progenitor , suggesting ion heating to temperatures of the order of k per nucleon .",
    "electron temperatures in snrs can be deduced from observations of thermal x - ray emission ( for a recent collection of observational studies , see zimmermann , trmper , & yorke 1996 ) , and are typically k. therefore , it is expected that  in these sources .",
    "inferences of electron to proton temperature ratios in active galactic nuclei are inconclusive , largely due to the absence of a marker for ion temperatures .",
    "the theoretical expectation that is derived from considerations of dissipation in the shock layer . in a diffusive acceleration process where spatial diffusion is effected via _",
    "elastic _ collisions of particles with magnetic irregularities that are anchored in the background fluid , the acceleration from thermal energies is effectively a velocity - dependent process ( e.g. see the reviews of drury 1983 ; jones & ellison 1991 ) .",
    "this situation corresponds to dissipative heating in the shock layer that is independent of mass of the species .",
    "baring et al .",
    "( 1997 ) illustrates such a situation in their modelling of accelerated proton and he populations at nearby interplanetary shocks .",
    "however , dissipation in the shock layer can not be entirely elastic in origin in any frame of reference , due in part to the different mobilities of electrons and ions . in a quasi - perpendicular shock ,",
    "it is clear that the much smaller larmor radii of electrons ( relative to ions ) that cross the shock lead to the establishment of induced electric fields via charge separation . in quasi - parallel shocks ,",
    "similar electric fields exist , due to the turbulence of the field structure in the shock layer .",
    "in fact , generalized shock structure including out - of - the plane magnetic field components requires the presence of electric fields in all frames of reference ( jones & ellison 1987 ; 1991 ) . such fields heat the low energy electrons at the expense of the energy of the ions ( see the discussion of jones 1999 ) , and thereby effect at least a partial equilibration in energy , providing significant theoretical support for the contention that . in general ,",
    "a complex array of wave modes and instabilities can precipitate strong acceleration / heating of electrons .",
    "limited evidence for such heating can be found in the hybrid plasma simulations of cargill and papadopoulos ( 1988 ) for non - relativistic shocks , and the full plasma simulations of hoshino et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for relativistic shocks in a pair - dominated ion - pair plasma .",
    "however , these two works do not simultaneously probe fully three - dimensional hydrogenic plasmas with truly realistic ion / electron mass ratios ( so as to address a full array of wave modes ) . three - dimensional simulations are required to accurately account for particle diffusion in all directions ( e.g. see the discussion in jones , jokipii & baring 1998 ) . hence , a definitive simulational assessment of the degree of electron heating in shocked plasmas remains an outstanding problem .",
    "the expected dominance of bremsstrahlung can be illustrated using model predictions from a monte carlo simulation of diffusive acceleration in non - relativistic shocks .",
    "the monte carlo technique used to model diffusive shock acceleration is well - documented in the literature ( e.g. see jones & ellison 1991 ; baring , ellison , & jones 1993 ; ellison , baring , & jones 1996 ; and more recently , baring et al .",

    "it is a kinematic model , closely following bell s ( 1978 ) approach to diffusive acceleration , where the simulation is used to calculate , in effect , solutions to a boltzmann equation for particle transport involving a collision operator , without making any assumption concerning the isotropy of particle distributions .",
    "particles are injected at a position far upstream and allowed to convect into the ( infinite plane , steady - state ) shock , diffusing between postulated scattering centers ( presumably magnetic irregularities in the background plasma and self - generated turbulence ) along the way . as particles diffuse between the upstream and downstream regions , they continually gain energy in accord with the fermi mechanism .",
    "particle splitting is used very effectively to maintain excellent statistics over a large dynamic range .",
    "the approach adopts a phenomenological mean free path , ( with for all ions and energetic electrons ; for near - thermal electrons , see baring et al .",
    "1999 for details ) to encompass the complications of plasma microphysics , where is the particle gyroradius .",
    "the aptness of this power - law prescription to shocked plasma environments is supported by particle observations at low energies at the earth s bow shock , ellison , mbius , & paschmann 1990 ) , deductions from ions accelerated in solar particle events ( mason , gloeckler , & hovestadt 1983 ) , and also from plasma simulations ( giacalone , burgess & schwartz 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the strong field turbulence expected ( and seen ) at shocks , near - bohm diffusion , , imposes an requirement .    0.0truein     0.1truein    typical predictions for the proton and electron distributions ( downstream of a shock ) using the monte carlo technique are depicted in figure  [ fig : comparison ] , taken from the ellison , goret & baring s ( 1999 ) study of shock acceleration in the supernova remnant cas a ( similar spectra are presented in baring et al .",
    "the distributions are exhibited as omni - directional fluxes ( i.e. differential energy fluxes multiplied by particle velocity : ) , mimicking the spectra measured by particle detectors in the heliosphere .",
    "hence , for non - relativistic speeds , the momentum ( or velocity ) distribution index is exactly twice the slope of the curves in figure  [ fig : comparison]a , while for ultra - relativistic particles , is identical to the depicted slopes , which for both the electrons and protons is roughly .",
    "the particular simulation output that is illustrated possesses a hot electron component in the downstream plasma , with a temperature roughly half that of the protons .",
    "the light power - law drawn in figure  [ fig : comparison]a , with a velocity distribution as labelled , approximates the proton distribution between thermal proton and thermal electron speeds ; it has an index of ( i.e. flux distribution ) .",
    "observe that the monte carlo curves are not pure power - laws in momentum but exhibit a slight upward curvature in the relativistic portions of the distributions ( and also significant curvature at suprathermal non - relativistic energies for the protons ) , a central feature of the non - linear feedback between the ion diffusion and the shock hydrodynamics in cosmic - ray modified shocks that is well - documented ( e.g. eichler 1984 ; ellison & eichler 1984 ; jones & ellison 1991 ; ellison , jones & baring 1996 ) . because such hydrodynamics is strongly regulated by the feedback between particle acceleration and",
    "escape from the remnant , the generated proton distributions are not very sensitive to the prescription of as a function of rigidity .",
    "electrons , on the other hand , are dynamically unimportant , so that their spectral normalization ( but not spectral shape ) is sensitive only to their injection efficiency , which couples to the electron - to - proton temperature ratio . while this is somewhat uncertain , we used reasonable shock speeds and observed x - ray temperatures from remnants ( e.g. zimmermann , trmper , & yorke 1996 ) to adopt appropriate values .",
    "note also that the ratio of the electron to proton populations in the 110 gev range ( contingent upon the assumed injection efficiency ) for the specific results in figure  [ fig : comparison]a varies between 15% and 5% , somewhat larger than observed cosmic ray ratio in this energy range ( e.g. see mller et al .",
    "1995 ) ; ratios more consistent with the cosmic ray data are readily obtained ( baring et al .",
    "1999 ) by the monte carlo simulation .    figure  [ fig : comparison]b depicts the emissivities for bremsstrahlung ( solid curve ) and inverse bremsstrahlung ( dashed curve ) that result from the particle distributions in figure  [ fig : comparison]a .",
    "the flat spectra below x - ray energies correspond to , approximating the low energy results in equations  ( [ eq : nrbrems_lim ] ) and  ( [ eq : nrinvbrems_lim ] ) , and interestingly , close to the index observed in the cosmic x - ray background below 10 kev ( thus motivating the application discussed in boldt & serlemitsos 1969 ) . above the electron thermal energy ,",
    "the spectra steepen for both processes , and in the gamma - ray regime , the inverse bremsstrahlung spectrum ( ) is steeper than that of bremsstrahlung ( ) , in accord with equation  ( [ eq : erbrems_lim ] ) and the discussion following equation  ( [ eq : erinvbrems_lim ] ) .",
    "we note that the steep shoulder in the bremsstrahlung spectrum in the x - ray band defining the roll - off above the thermal emission could potentially provide an alternative explanation ( baring et al .",
    "1999 ) to synchrotron emission for the non - thermal x - rays seen in the supernova remnants sn 1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ) , ic 443 ( keohane et al .  1997 ) and cas a ( allen et al .",
    "the illustrated case , of index for just over half a decade in energy , lies in between the index of asca obtained for ic 443 and the x - ray observations of cas a and sn1006 ( ) .",
    "while this issue is discussed in more detail in ellison , goret & baring ( 1999 ) , it is important to remark that inferences of the spectral index of a non - thermal component in x - ray data are very sensitive to the choice of temperature of a thermal component and the shape of a non - thermal continuum .",
    "restrictions to pure power - laws for the continuum , while convenient , are not really appropriate for either synchrotron radiation turnovers or bremsstrahlung emission mechanisms , so that conclusions about the physical mechanism in operation should be guarded .",
    "for example , the rxte data in allen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on cas a suggests a spectral break at kev , steepening from an index to one of , data that at first sight does not appear inconsistent with a bremsstrahlung model in the transition region from thermal to non - thermal energies ( though probably with a slightly higher temperature than the case depicted in figure  [ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "the critical distinction between synchrotron turnover and `` transition '' bremsstrahlung models therefore lies in the expected flattening above the transition region in the bremsstrahlung spectrum ( e.g. see figure  [ fig : comparison]b ) .",
    "this provides an observational discriminant via broader - band observations beyond the scope of asca and rxte , though current instrumental sensitivities ( such as those of xmm and integral ) are probably insufficient to answer this question .",
    "a related situation arises with diffuse / unresolved emission in the galactic ridge , and recent broad - band x - ray spectra of the scutum arm ( valinia , kinzer & marshall 1999 ) suggest a turnover in the 50100 kev range , which could indicate the superposition of comptonized ( or synchrotron ) emission from unresolved discrete sources . however , we note that data statistics in the osse band are not sufficient to preclude a flattening at higher energies that would be characteristic of bremsstrahlung of either discrete source or diffuse origin .    returning to the issue at hand , the particular example in figure  [ fig : comparison ]",
    "gives a strong dominance of bremsstrahlung over inverse bremsstrahlung .",
    "in fact , given the index for non - relativistic speeds , and , equation  ( [ eq : ratios ] ) can be simply applied to estimate a ratio of between the two processes ( for ) , close to the ratio deduced in the optical band from figure  [ fig : comparison]b .",
    "this agreement highlights the viability and usefulness of the schematic distributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crdists ] ) , and also that of the consequent quantitative estimates of the various emissivities throughout this paper .",
    "observe that the only way to increase is to dramatically lower the temperature of the electrons relative to the protons , but to do so would cause a corresponding decrease in the ratio at relativistic energies ( and influence the ratio of injection efficiencies ) , well below observed values in the 10 gev band ( see , e.g. mller et al .",
    "1995 , for a recent compendium of data ) .",
    "as argued above , it is unlikely that will be realized often in shocked astrophysical plasmas .",
    "it is natural to question whether such a result holds for ions heavier than protons .",
    "clearly , both the bremsstrahlung and inverse bremsstrahlung contributions from helium and heavier elements are given by their abundance ( usually small ) multiplied by .",
    "the enhancement provides significant bremsstrahlung emissivities when helium targets ( typically of abundance ) are involved . for inverse bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the amplification potentially could be offset by a more severe mass ratio reduction , if lower thermal speeds are precipitated downstream of shocks .",
    "there is little or no evidence for such lower thermal speeds for ions heavier than protons .",
    "in fact , the ulysses swics data on the 91097 interplanetary shock unequivocally indicates the contrary : the shock dissipation mechanism generates virtually identical velocity dispersions for both protons and alpha particles ( baring , et al .",
    "such a property is well - modelled by the monte carlo technique , since the elastic scattering hypothesis that it employs renders the shock acceleration model a velocity - dependent injector .",
    "this scattering assumption , together with a rigidity - dependent diffusion coefficient , is rigorously put to the test in the successful prediction ( meyer , drury , & ellison 1997 ; ellison , drury , & meyer 1997 ) of abundances of ions of various metallicities in the cosmic ray population , using a supernova remnant site for the acceleration of dust grains .",
    "these pieces of evidence point to an approximate velocity equipartition of thermal ions in shocks , so that the criterion in equation  ( [ eq : ratios ] ) renders the conclusion that inverse bremsstrahlung is generally insignificant in shocked astrophysical plasmas also applicable to contributions from ions heavier than protons .",
    "the unimportance of inverse bremsstrahlung for shocked environs in discrete sources , the principal result of this paper , can be interpreted in the broader context of invocations of inverse bremsstrahlung in diffuse emission problems .",
    "the pre - eminent implication of this result is obviously that supernova remnants will dominate their environs in x - ray and gamma - ray luminosity , and therefore will obscure truly diffuse emission components in extended regions such as the galactic ridge and the orion complex , if the source remnants are too densely clustered .",
    "hence , it is of significant interest to identify the length scales on which discrete sources such as supernova remnants provide a dominant contribution to unresolved x - ray and gamma - ray emission in the galaxy , as a guide to modelers and also to aid the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "the discussion of this issue is not restricted to just the ratio of bremsstrahlung from cosmic ray primary ( i.e. shock - accelerated ) electrons and inverse bremsstrahlung from cosmic ray ions . the works of tatischeff , ramaty & kozlovsky ( 1998 ) and dogiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung emission levels are comparable to those of bremsstrahlung from knock - on electrons in the orion complex , given the then ( and now defunct ) comptel nuclear line detection in this region .",
    "knock - on electrons are generated from the cool ambient interstellar population via coulomb collisions with energetic cosmic ray ions ( and perhaps electrons ) . since the stopping length ( on ambient electrons _ or _",
    "protons ) for 25 kev electrons in interstellar environments of typical density is of the order of 100 pc ( e.g. see valinia & marshall 1998 ) , coulomb collisions are clearly relevant for electrons in large scale systems such as the orion cloud complex .",
    "coulomb scattering simultaneously mediates both energization of ambient electrons and cooling of cosmic ray primary electrons .",
    "in contrast , shocked astrophysical plasmas such as those in young to middle - aged supernova remnants are collisionless , so that knock - on populations are locally negligible .",
    "given the conclusions of this paper relating to shock - heated plasmas , it is salient to also examine when knock - on electron bremsstrahlung is a significant contributor to diffuse / unresolved emission relative to primary electron bremsstrahlung .",
    "note that the comparisons of tatischeff , ramaty & kozlovsky ( 1998 ) and dogiel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to knock - on electron bremsstrahlung did not include an abundant , shock - accelerated electron population , and therefore did not address this issue .",
    "first , we address the question of whether knock - on electrons are abundant relative to cosmic ray primary electrons . for mono - energetic cosmic rays ,",
    "non - relativistic knock - on electrons possess an kinetic energy distribution regardless of whether the energetic cosmic rays are ions ( e.g. see hayakawa 1969 ) or electrons ( gould 1972 ; true also for relativistic electrons : see baring 1991 ) , which corresponds to a velocity distribution .",
    "this is comparable in steepness to the shock - accelerated electron distribution exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison]a . however , in spite of the ambient ( and therefore also knock - on ) electrons being much more abundant than cosmic ray ones , the relative population level at almost relativistic speeds defines the criterion for the importance of knock - on electrons in producing x - ray bremsstrahlung .",
    "the knock - on electron population extends upward from extremely low thermal energies ( temperatures of 3100 k ; see dogiel et al .",
    "1998 for a listing of parameters for the orion complex ) .",
    "assuming that only a minority of ambient electrons can be energized in knock - on collisions without disturbing the thermal balance of the ambient interstellar medium , it is straightforward to determine that the distribution mev@xmath24 @xmath25 forms a conservative upper bound to the knock - on energy distribution out to mev energies . here is the ism temperature in units of 10 k , and is the ism density in units of @xmath25 , typically of the order of @xmath25 in the normal ism , and @xmath25 in dense interstellar regions .",
    "also , is the electron energy in units of mev .",
    "0.3truein     0.1truein    this upper bound is actually a gross overestimate , given that it corresponds to 100% of the ambient electron population being energized .",
    "furthermore , due to the kinematic maxima for the energies imparted to cold electrons by coulomb collisions , above the thermal speed of the ballistic cosmic rays , which for ionic projectiles is unlikely to exceed typical shock speeds for supernova remnants of a 500 - 3000 km / sec , the knock - on spectrum steepens from the dependence .",
    "the knock - on distribution can then be shown to roughly follow an distribution for a cosmic ray ion spectrum ( derivable , for example , using eq .",
    "( 9 ) of baring 1991 ) , rendering the knock - on electron population at around 100 kev far smaller than the above bound ; see figure  [ fig : knock - on ] for a schematic depiction .",
    "an approximate refined estimate for the knock - on distribution would then be mev@xmath24 @xmath25 for .",
    "this can be compared with a rough estimate for the non - thermal electron distribution expected for efficient acceleration at a remnant s shock : mev@xmath24 @xmath25 , where here is the shocked plasma temperature in units of k. since near snr shocks , clearly the primary cosmic ray source spectrum locally swamps the knock - on one .",
    "away from such shocks , diffusion dilutes the primary source spectrum down to cosmic ray flux levels .    while a specific prediction for the ambient cosmic ray primary electron density could be made via a particular acceleration model ( such as the monte carlo technique used above ) ,",
    "combined with a specific diffusive propagation model , we prefer to make use of existing experimental cosmic ray data under the premise that dense interstellar regions are not extraordinarily peculiar in their cosmic ray properties .",
    "mller et al . (",
    "1995 ; see also mller & tang 1987 ) exhibit the primary electron flux at earth above around 3 gev . from their data ,",
    "one quickly arrives at the differential energy distribution for electrons of mev@xmath24 @xmath25 at energies above 3 gev .",
    "direct extrapolation of this down to 100 kev ( i.e. well - below energies where heliospheric modulation impacts measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum ) would lead to the conclusion that cosmic ray electrons should dominate the maximum possible density of knock - on electrons by around 4 orders of magnitude , and the refined estimate above of the knock - on density by a factor of or more ( for ) , for realistic values of the ism temperature . however , the primary electron spectrum is probably much flatter in the 100 kev to 3 gev band than measured at higher energies .",
    "the diffuse radio synchrotron emission in the 30600 mhz band ( ) in our galaxy suggests ( e.g. see the review by webber 1997 ) a cosmic ray electron distribution between 500 mev and 2.2 gev .",
    "this flattening probably reflects the transition from directly sampling contributions to the cosmic ray spectrum near discrete sources ( which generally should possess flatter distributions like those in figure  [ fig : comparison ] ) to larger - scale steepening imposed by cosmic ray propagation effects . even using an extrapolation mev@xmath24 @xmath25 at energies below 300 mev based on the inferences from the radio data ,",
    "one arrives at the conclusion that the cosmic ray primary electron population would far exceed any knock - on component generated by cosmic ray ions .",
    "hence , it follows that a knock - on population of electrons can only generate a significant amount of electron bremsstrahlung emission in dense interstellar regions provided that there is a profound paucity of cosmic ray electrons in the 30 kev1 mev range .",
    "cooling of electrons through coulomb and ionization losses potentially can create such a paucity ; lower energy electrons cool faster than more energetic ones do .",
    "therefore , a depletion of cosmic ray electrons below 1 mev is a distinct possibility on scales considerably greater than 10pc outside the supernova remnants that act as sources of cosmic rays .",
    "specifically , using the numbers quoted by valinia and marshall ( 1998 ) , 25 kev electrons that would emit bremsstrahlung in the rxte band have a collisional loss pathlength of around 100pc in the ism .",
    "this linear scale can be translated into a radial scale by incorporating the effects of diffusion due to the turbulent interstellar field .",
    "the mean free path for such diffusion is extremely uncertain , but as is the case for the undisturbed interplanetary medium in the heliosphere , estimates for ( by coupling to the field irregularity scale ; e.g. see kim , kronberg & landecker 1988 ) far exceed particle gyroradii , at around 100pc .",
    "this implies that for 25 kev electrons , pc defines the maximal extent of their `` coulomb halo '' around a snr . for higher energy electrons ,",
    "the radius of this halo is larger , so that at any given radius , the primary electron spectrum is depleted up to the energy at which coulomb losses become insignificant .    irrespective of whether and on what scales such depletions exist ( no data pertaining to cosmic ray electrons samples this energy range )",
    ", the dominance of bremsstrahlung from primary cosmic ray electrons over inverse bremsstrahlung from primary cosmic ray protons that is established in this paper would lead to the major contribution to unresolved `` diffuse '' x - ray emission in orion or the galactic ridge coming from discrete sources , unless the volume filling factor of supernova remnants in the interstellar medium is less than . while accurate determination of this factor is difficult , extant compendia of supernova remnants ( e.g. helfand et al .",
    "1989 ; green , 1999 ) lead to estimates at the lower end of this range ( i.e. ) , to order of magnitude .",
    "hence , while it is possible that such conditions might prevail in some galactic interstellar environments , and more probably at moderate latitudes above the disk , we contend that primary cosmic ray electron bremsstrahlung will simultaneously dominate bremsstrahlung from secondary knock - on electrons and inverse bremsstrahlung mediated by cosmic ray ions as contributors to diffuse x - ray emission in the most important and interesting environments .",
    "when this is not the case , primary electron bremsstrahlung signals ( of spectral index 23 ) will be confined to discrete source locales of scales 100pc , i.e. near supernova remnants , while suprathermal proton bremsstrahlung and knock - on electron bremsstrahlung ( of similar spectral indices ) will sample the length scales appropriate to ionic collisional losses , namely mpc for the 50mev protons that can generate inverse bremsstrahlung x - rays in the rxte band . to reiterate ,",
    "these length scales will be appropriately contracted in linear dimensions if they exceed the diffusive scales for such particles in the interstellar magnetic field ( e.g. to kpc from the protons : see valinia and marshall 1998 ) .",
    "such radiation `` clumping '' issues should form a focus of discussions of diffuse and unresolved emissions . note that",
    "because mev cosmic ray protons are not easily depleted on scales kpc , and since the low ism temperature forces the knock - on distribution to low levels , we expect that generally inverse bremsstrahlung dominates knock - on electron bremsstrahlung outside remnants .",
    "an observationally interesting question concerns how easily bremsstrahlung signals from primary cosmic ray electrons associated with snrs can by distinguished from truly compact sources such as neutron stars or black holes , given current angular resolution capabilities of x - ray telescopes .",
    "spectral signatures may provide the answer prior to improvements in instrumental resolving power .",
    "the similarity of unresolved emission spectra in source - rich and source - poor galactic regions ( asca data : tanaka , miyaji & hasinger 1999 ) , and the spectral similitude of observations of the scutum arm ( rxte / osse data : valinia , kinzer & marshall 1999 ) and galactic x - ray binaries and black hole candidates provide clues impinging upon this issue .",
    "observe also that the expected general dominance of bremsstrahlung from primary electrons returns one to the energetics issues raised by skibo , ramaty & purcell ( 1996 ) , who discerned that the general inefficiency of bremsstrahlung processes in the x - ray band relative to collisional and ionization losses elicits difficulties in generating the requisite luminosity . in passing ,",
    "we note that clumping of emission in the proximity of remnants will help alleviate the energy supply problem for a bremsstrahlung origin of the galactic diffuse x - ray emission , by diminishing such losses for the electrons .",
    "in conclusion , the results of this paper indicate that inverse bremsstrahlung in the optical to x - ray and gamma - ray bands can be safely neglected in most models of discrete sources invoking shock acceleration .",
    "this follows from the approximate ratio , posited in equation  ( [ eq : ratios ] ) , of inverse bremsstrahlung to bremsstrahlung from primary non - thermal electrons , together with expectations for dissipational heating of electrons in the shock layer .",
    "both observational and theoretical evidence favors electron temperatures almost comparable to , and certainly not very deficient relative to , proton temperatures in shocked plasmas . hence shocked environments in discrete sources such as supernova remnants should have inverse bremsstrahlung contributing only in a minor capacity to the overall emission , a situation that could apply also to larger , extended interstellar regions such as the galactic ridge , provided that the volume filling factor associated with remnants exceeds around . since this filling factor may sometimes be lower , perhaps at moderate to high galactic latitudes , we find that in such cases , inverse bremsstrahlung can contribute significantly in the x - ray band on length scales of the order of 50100pc or greater , thereby posing an interesting observational goal to resolve bright bremsstrahlung x - ray emission concentrated around discrete sources from any truly diffuse inverse bremsstrahlung component that spatially traces the cosmic ray ion population .",
    "we also contend that bremsstrahlung from knock - on electrons is probably always a minor contribution , and find that the dominance of bremsstrahlung from primary cosmic ray electrons over inverse bremsstrahlung in the vicinity of remnants is even more enhanced in the gamma - ray band .",
    "we thank stephen reynolds , elihu boldt , azita valinia and peter serlemitsos for discussions , vincent tatischeff and the anonymous referee for comments helpful to the improvement of the presentation , and bob gould for pointing out certain literature on bremsstrahlung to us .        in this brief appendix , a pedagogical alternative to the derivation of the various bremsstrahlung emissivities",

    "<S> there has recently been interest in the role of inverse bremsstrahlung , the emission of photons by fast suprathermal ions in collisions with ambient electrons possessing relatively low velocities , in tenuous plasmas in various astrophysical contexts . </S>",
    "<S> this follows a long hiatus in the application of suprathermal ion bremsstrahlung to astrophysical models since the early 1970s . </S>",
    "<S> the potential importance of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to normal bremsstrahlung , i.e. where ions are at rest , hinges upon the underlying velocity distributions of the interacting species . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the conditions under which the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity is significant relative to that for normal bremsstrahlung in shocked astrophysical plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> we determine that , since both observational and theoretical evidence favors electron temperatures almost comparable to , and certainly not very deficient relative to proton temperatures in shocked plasmas , these environments generally render inverse bremsstrahlung at best a minor contributor to the overall emission . hence inverse </S>",
    "<S> bremsstrahlung can be safely neglected in most models invoking shock acceleration in discrete sources such as supernova remnants . however , on scales pc distant from these sources , coulomb collisional losses can deplete the cosmic ray electrons , rendering inverse bremsstrahlung , and perhaps bremsstrahlung from knock - on electrons , possibly detectable . </S>"
