    "we have recently given a simple combinatorial model for the irreducible characters of a complex semisimple lie group @xmath1 and , more generally , for the _ demazure characters _",
    "@xcite . for reasons explained below ,",
    "we call our model the _ alcove path model_. this was extended to complex symmetrizable kac - moody algebras in @xcite ( that is , to infinite root systems ) . in this context",
    ", we also gave a _",
    "littlewood - richardson rule _ for decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations and a branching rule .",
    "the exposition in @xcite was in the context of the equivariant @xmath2-theory of the generalized flag variety @xmath3 ; more precisely , we first derived a _",
    "chevalley - type multiplication formula _ in @xmath4 , and then we deduced from it our demazure character formula .",
    "by contrast , the exposition in @xcite was purely representation theoretic , being based on stembridge s combinatorial model for weyl characters @xcite .",
    "the alcove path model leads to an extensive generalization of the combinatorics of irreducible characters from lie type @xmath0 ( where the combinatorics is based on young tableaux , for instance ) to arbitrary type ; our approach is type - independent .",
    "the present paper continues the study of the combinatorics of the new model , which was started in @xcite .",
    "a future publication will be concerned with a direct generalization of the notion of the product of young tableaux in the context of the product of crystals .",
    "the main results of this paper are :    1 .   a combinatorial description of the crystal graphs corresponding to the irreducible representations ( corollary [ all - cryst ] ) ; this result includes a transparent proof , based on the yang - baxter equation , of the fact that the mentioned description does not depend on the choice involved in our model ( corollary [ isom - graphs ] ) ; 2 .",
    "a combinatorial realization of lusztig s involution @xcite on the canonical basis ( theorem [ sch - inv - desc ] , see also example [ ex - inv ] ) ; this involution exhibits the crystals as self - dual posets , and corresponds to the action of the longest weyl group element on an irreducible representation ; our combinatorial realization is the first direct generalization of _ schtzenberger s involution _ on tableaux ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; 3 .",
    "an analog for arbitrary root systems , based on the yang - baxter equation , of schtzenberger s _ sliding _ algorithm , which is also known as _",
    "jeu de taquin _ ( section [ yb - moves ] ) ; this algorithm has many applications to the representation theory of the lie algebra of type @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our model is based on the choice of an _ alcove path _ , which is a sequence of adjacent alcoves for the _ affine weyl group _",
    "@xmath5 of the langland s dual group @xmath6 .",
    "an alcove path is best represented as a _",
    "@xmath7-chain _ , that is , as a sequence of positive roots corresponding to the common walls of successive alcoves in the mentioned sequence of alcoves .",
    "these chains extend the notion of a _ reflection ordering _",
    "@xcite . given a fixed @xmath7-chain , the objects that generalize semistandard young tableaux are all the subsequences of roots that give rise to saturated increasing chains in bruhat order ( on the weyl group @xmath8 ) upon multiplying on the right by the corresponding reflections .",
    "we call these subsequences _ admissible subsets_. in @xcite we defined _ root operators _ on admissible subsets , which are certain partial operators associated with the simple roots ; in type @xmath0 , they correspond to the _ coplactic operations _ on tableaux @xcite .",
    "the root operators produce a directed colored graph structure and a poset structure on admissible subsets .",
    "we showed in @xcite that this graph is isomorphic to the crystal graph of the corresponding irreducible representation if the chosen @xmath7-chain is a special one .",
    "all this background information on the alcove path model is explained in more detail in section [ alc - path ] , following some general background material discussed in section [ prelim ] .    in section [ yb - moves ] , we study certain discrete moves which allow us to deform any @xmath7-chain into any other @xmath7-chain ( for a fixed dominant weight @xmath7 ) , and to biject the corresponding admissible subsets .",
    "we call these moves _ yang - baxter moves _ since they express the fact that certain operators satisfy the _ yang - baxter equation_. we will explain below the reason for which the yang - baxter moves can be considered an analog of jeu de taquin for arbitrary root systems .",
    "we show that the yang - baxter moves commute with the root operators ; this means that the directed colored graph defined by the root operators is invariant under yang - baxter moves , and it is thus independent from the choice of a @xmath7-chain . based on the special case in @xcite discussed above",
    ", this immediately implies that the mentioned graph is isomorphic to the corresponding crystal graph for any choice of a @xmath7-chain .    in section [ sch - inv ]",
    ", we present a combinatorial description of lusztig s involution @xmath9 on the _",
    "canonical basis_. such a description was given by schtzenberger in type @xmath0 in terms of tableaux , and the corresponding procedure is known as _",
    "evacuation_. the importance of this involution stems from the fact that it exhibits the crystals as self - dual posets , and it corresponds to the action of the longest weyl group element on an irreducible representation ; it also appears in other contexts , such as the recent realization of the category of crystals as a _ coboundary category _",
    "our description of lusztig s involution is very similar to that of the evacuation map .",
    "the main ingredient in defining the latter map , namely schtzenberger s sliding algorithm ( also known as jeu de taquin ) , is replaced by yang - baxter moves .",
    "there is another ingredient , which has to do with `` reversing '' a @xmath7-chain and an associated admissible subset , by analogy with reversing the word of a tableau in the definition of the evacuation map .",
    "our construction also leads to a purely combinatorial proof of the fact that the crystals ( as defined by our root operators ) are self - dual posets . in section [ other - appl ] ,",
    "we present several applications ; in particular , we give an intrinsic explanation for the fact that our procedure is an involution .",
    "we will now briefly discuss the relationship between our model and other models for characters .",
    "we explained in @xcite that our model can be viewed as a discrete counterpart to the _ littelmann path model _",
    "@xcite , which is based on enumerating certain continuous paths in @xmath10 .",
    "these paths are constructed recursively , by starting with an initial one , and by applying certain root operators . by making specific choices for the initial path",
    ", one can obtain special cases which have more explicit descriptions .",
    "for instance , a straight line initial path leads to the _ lakshmibai - seshadri paths _ ( ls paths ) @xcite ; these were introduced before littelmann s work , in the context of _ standard monomial theory _",
    "a model closely related to littelmann paths is the one due to gaussent and littelmann  @xcite , which is based on _ ls - galleries_. in @xcite we discussed in detail the relationship of the alcove path model with littelmann paths , ls paths , and ls - galleries .",
    "we explained the reasons for which the alcove path model is not simply a translation of the littelmann path model into a different language .",
    "we also showed that our model has certain advantages due to its simplicity and combinatorial nature ; it also compares favorably in terms of computational complexities ( see also subsection [ complexity ] ) .    the results in this paper highlight new advantages of the alcove path model .",
    "for instance , we mentioned above our transparent combinatorial explanation , based on the yang - baxter moves , for the independence of the directed colored graph defined by the root operators from the choice of a @xmath7-chain ( corollary [ isom - graphs ] ) .",
    "similarly , it was proved in @xcite that the directed colored graph structure on littelmann paths generated by the corresponding root operators is independent of the initial path . however ,",
    "this proof , which is based on continuous arguments , is less transparent .",
    "as far as analogs of schtzenberger s jeu de taquin are concerned , let us first mention the extensions to types @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 due to lecouvey and sheats @xcite .",
    "let us also note that the only such analog known in the littelmann path model is the one due to van leeuwen @xcite .",
    "the goal of the mentioned paper was to use this analog in order to express in a bijective manner the symmetry of the littlewood - richardson rule in the littelmann path model . in a future publication , we will show that van leeuwen s jeu de taquin realizes precisely the commutator in the category of crystals that was defined in @xcite .",
    "as far as our combinatorial realization of lusztig s involution is concerned , let us note that the alcove path model reveals an interesting feature of it , which does not seem to be known even in type @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is related to certain weyl group elements associated with an admissible subset , which we call _ initial _ and _ final keys _ ( see definition [ defkeys ] and remark [ remkeys ] ) , and which are related to the demazure character formula in theorem [ demform ] . more precisely , lusztig s involution interchanges the two keys in the sense mentioned in corollary [ conjkeys ] .",
    "let us also note that no combinatorial realization of lusztig s involution is available in the littelmann path model . however , an explicit description of it is given in @xcite in a different model for characters , which is based on _",
    "lusztig s parametrization _ and the _ string parametrization _ of the dual canonical basis @xcite . unlike the combinatorial approach in schtzenberger s evacuation procedure ,",
    "the involution is now expressed as an affine map whose coefficients are entries of the corresponding cartan matrix .",
    "no intrinsic explanation for the fact that this map is an involution is available .",
    "we believe that the properties of our model that were investigated in @xcite as well as in this paper represent just a small fraction of a rich combinatorial structure yet to be explored , which would generalize most of the combinatorics of young tableaux .",
