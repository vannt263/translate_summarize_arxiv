    "a common technique for the incorporation of dopant atoms into sic is ion implantation .",
    "the post - implantation annealing is needed to reduce the damage . at the same time",
    ", the thermal treatment creates new stable defect centers which influence the material properties .",
    "the persistent centers that tend to grow even at annealing temperatures above 1000@xmath3c are e.g.  the photoluminescence ( pl ) centers d@xmath4 ( ref .  ) and d@xmath1 ( ref .  ) .",
    "most likely , the formation of these centers is related to the aggregation of the intrinsic defects .",
    "for example , vacancy or antisite clusters have been discussed@xcite in conjunction with the d@xmath4-center .",
    "the d@xmath1-center , with its rich vibrational spectrum located above the sic phonon spectrum , is considered as a carbon - related defect.@xcite up to now , the complexity of the vibrational spectrum prevents an unambiguous identification of the microscopic structure .",
    "however , the theoretical investigations of the vibrational spectrum of small carbon clusters indicates that the dicarbon antisite ( a carbon pair at the silicon site ) is an important structural element of this defect.@xcite besides the d@xmath1-center , further carbon - related defects have been identified recently.@xcite the photoluminescence centers p@xmath2u appear in irradiated material and vanish between 1000@xmath3c@xmath21300@xmath3c.@xcite based on the analysis of @xmath0c isotope shifts of the lvm frequencies , a carbon split - interstitial model was suggested for the p@xmath2 t centers.@xcite this proposal was recently questioned@xcite and an alternative model was proposed . generally ,",
    "although the exact microscopic models for these defects remain to be established , it is clear that they all are due to the aggregation of carbon interstitials in smaller or larger clusters , which constitute a fundamentally important class of defects in sic .",
    "the finding , that the carbon interstitials aggregate , can help to resolve a controversy regarding the formation of the persistent defect centers .",
    "namely , the predicted high mobility of the carbon split - interstitials@xcite should hinder the formation of d@xmath1 centers at high temperatures@xcite and opposes the thermal stability of the p@xmath2 t centers.@xcite due to the high mobility , the carbon interstitials , which are a key ingredient of these centers,@xcite should have vanished at elevated temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , both features are observed experimentally . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent tentative assignment@xcite of the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) centers t5 in 3c - sic ( ref .  ) , and ei1 and ei3 ( ref .  ) in 4h - sic to carbon split - interstitials , which is based on the comparison of calculated and measured hyperfine parameters , supports the prediction of the high mobility .",
    "these centers anneal between 150@xmath3c and 240@xmath3c .",
    "a low temperature annealing of the silicon and carbon interstitials was also suggested for irradiated or implanted material by our theoretical analysis of competing annealing mechanisms.@xcite the interstitial migration and the vacancy - interstitial recombination are activated at much lower temperatures than other mechanisms .",
    "we recently proposed@xcite that small carbon aggregates may provide the missing link between the carbon interstitials and the persistent carbon - related defects .",
    "such aggregates may trap interstitials at lower temperatures and re - emit them again at higher temperatures , or even represent persistent photoluminescence centers themselves .",
    "also in the transient enhanced dopant diffusion ( ted ) the carbon aggregates may serve as a source of carbon interstitials similarly to the so - called \\{311}-defects in silicon,@xcite which emit silicon interstitials and thereby facilitate the ted .",
    "a thorough investigation of small and larger carbon aggregates should provide an important information concerning their role in the annealing of implantation damage",
    ". theoretical prediction of their vibrational spectra could also help to identify the microscopic structure of the pl - centers . yet",
    ", the assignment of a particular defect structure to pl centers from the phonon replicas alone is difficult . as an additional information",
    ", the thermal stability and growth / annealing mechanisms of the clusters may be investigated by analyzing the dissociation energy of the defect complex and its preceding configurations .",
    "sofar , theoretical investigations focused on di - interstitials and small interstitial clusters at antisites.@xcite a detailed discussion of the vibrational signature of larger clusters is still missing .",
    "in the present article we investigate the structure , dissociation energies and vibrational properties of carbon interstitial and antisite aggregates and of larger clusters involving up to four carbon interstitials .",
    "we employ an _ ab initio _ method within the framework of density functional theory .",
    "the isotope shifts of defects with a distinct and clear splitting pattern are presented .",
    "although theoretically all these defects can acquire different charge states , we focus on the neutral state as the most relevant for pl experiments .",
    "the pl due to bound excitons at a charged defect is unlikely to be seen as more non - radiative recombination channels are open in this case.@xcite we have found high - frequency lvms with up to 250mev for small and compact defect clusters at antisites and",
    "lvms up to 200mev for interstitial clusters . as the cluster size increases , the frequency of the highest mode drops . in general",
    ", we find that the bond length between the involved carbon atoms , which is a measure of the bond strength , plays a crucial role .",
    "the analysis of further antisite - based clusters provides additional support for the previously suggested model of the dicarbon antisite as a core structure of the d@xmath1 center.@xcite the vibrational signature and the isotope shifts of the split - interstitial in the tilted configuration favor this defect as a candidate for the p@xmath2 t centers , although an assignment to the dicarbon antisite can not be completely rejected .",
    "the existence of lvms up to 250mev for compact antisite clusters shows that the original suggestion of a completely carbon - based @xmath5-center is possible . a comparison with theoretical results for diamond@xcite reveals that interstitial defects with similar behavior as in sic are also found in this structurally very similar material .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section  [ sec : method ] is denoted to a description of the method . in secs .",
    "[ sec : interst - clust ] and  [ sec : antisite - clusters ] we present our results for interstitial and antisite clusters in detail and illustrate the rich variety of possible defect structures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] the results will be discussed in the light of experimental and theoretical data .",
    "a summary concludes the article .",
    "our first principles calculations have been carried out using the plane wave pseudopotential package @xcite within the density functional theory ( dft ) formalism.@xcite the details of the method can be found in ref .  .",
    "for the expansion of the kohn - sham wave functions a basis set of 30ryd cut - off energy is used . the exchange - correlation potential taken in the local density approximation ( lsda).@xcite for the calculation of the defect energetics large supercells with 216 lattice sites",
    "have been employed for 3c - sic and with 128 lattice sites for 4h - sic .",
    "the brillouin zone has been sampled at the @xmath6 point in 3c - sic , in 4h - sic a @xmath7 monkhorst - pack mesh@xcite has been used .",
    "all atoms in the cell have been allowed to relax .",
    "the abundance of a defect under equilibrium conditions is given by its formation energy .",
    "however , as the radiative production of the defects is not an equilibrium process , the relevance of the formation energy is rather limited .",
    "for the formation and the stability of the carbon clusters in damaged material the dissociation energy is the more important quantity .",
    "it is defined as an energy needed to remove a single atom from the defect .",
    "this quantity describes the thermal stability of a defect . in practice , for the carbon clusters ,",
    "the dissociation energy is the energy difference between the total energy of the cluster and the total energy of the cluster with one carbon atom less plus the energy of an infinitely remote carbon interstitial : @xmath8    here c@xmath9 denotes the @xmath10 carbon split - interstitial , which is the energetically lowest carbon interstitial . since the most stable configuration of the isolated carbon defect is used as the reference energy , the eq .",
    "( [ eq : ed ] ) gives the lower bound of the dissociation barrier .",
    "we note that the tilted @xmath10 split - interstitial configuration has been chosen , which is about 0.5ev lower in energy than the symmetric @xmath10-geometry.@xcite the corresponding values of the formation energies are 6.7ev in 3c - sic and 7.3ev in 4h - sic . for all dissociation",
    "energies the neutral charge state has been assumed , as the carbon clusters are typically neutral in a typical range of the fermi level ( cf .",
    "[ sec : interst - clust ] and [ sec : antisite - clusters ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the vibrational modes has been performed in large supercells employing the defect molecule approximation . in this approximation",
    "the atoms belonging to the defect as well as the nearest neighbors are systematically displaced by about 0.15@xmath20.7% of the bond length and the dynamical matrix is calculated from the energy variation .",
    "the forces have been converged to a relative accuracy of @xmath11 .",
    "a detailed outline of the technique is given in ref .  .",
    "for the calculation of the dynamical matrix in 4h - sic the brillouin zone has been sampled by the @xmath6 point .",
    "it has been verified that the accuracy of the lvm calculation is not affected by this change . as we have shown earlier,@xcite the main effect on the accuracy results from the uncertainty in the lattice constant ( the lattice constant of the supercell including the defect differs slightly from that of the ideal lattice ) and from the defect molecule approximation ( which affects the energetically lowest lvms close to the bulk spectrum ) . due to the former",
    "the lvms may change up to 10mev when varying the lattice constant from the experimental value to the ( smaller ) theoretical lda value .",
    "the latter results in a lowering of the energetically lowest lvms . in some cases , referred to in the text , a 64 sites cell has been used to calculate the lvms . in these cases",
    "all atoms of the cell were included into the dynamical matrix .",
    "the most important feature of pl centers is the zero phonon line ( zpl ) that originates from a direct recombination of the bound exciton without involving the lvm s .",
    "unfortunately , an analysis of the recombination process is beyond the capabilities of the static dft - based methods .",
    "we therefore do not consider the recombination by itself , but focus on the vibrational modes as fingerprints of the particular carbon aggregates .",
    "interstitial clusters are the simplest carbon aggregates .",
    "the original lattice structure is not altered , no antisites or vacancies are needed for the cluster formation .",
    "the only prerequisite is an availability of carbon interstitials . due to a large formation energy of more than",
    "6.5ev the equilibrium concentration of these defects is well below the detectable limit .",
    "hence the formation of the carbon clusters in a noteworthy concentration is possible only in irradiated or implanted material .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in addition to the clustering , the dicarbon antisites can trap carbon interstitials .",
    "examples are the tricarbon and the tetracarbon antisite ( cf .",
    "[ fig : antisite - clust]a center and right ) . both are tightly bound defects with three or four carbon atoms at a single silicon site .",
    "the tricarbon antisite is a triangle - shaped defect with its base oriented in @xmath12 direction .",
    "the capture of a carbon interstitial by the dicarbon antisite yields the energy of 4.8ev ( cf . tab .",
    "[ tab : cluster - bind ] ) .",
    "this capture may occur via several intermediate configurations , which are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : antisite - clust]b .",
    "first , a carbon interstitial is trapped at a neighboring carbon site ( fig .",
    "[ fig : antisite - clust]b left , configuration @xmath13 ) with an energy of 1.4ev .",
    "this is about 1ev higher than the migration barrier for the neutral carbon split - interstitial.@xcite in a second step , a square configuration of the tricarbon antisite may form ( cf .",
    "[ fig : antisite - clust]b right , configuration @xmath14 ) , with the additional energy gain of 2.2ev ( @xmath15ev ) .",
    "this configuration is metastable and has also been found by gali _ _ et al.__@xcite with a dissociation energy of 4.0ev . in a last step ,",
    "the triangular configuration is finally formed ( configuration ( c@xmath16)@xmath17 ) , yielding an additional 1.2ev .",
    "this process is also possible in 4h - sic  an adjacent split - interstitial to the dicarbon antisite is bound with 1.9ev ( configuration @xmath13 in tab .  [ tab : cluster - bind ] ) , yielding an additional energy gain of 3.8ev in the triangular configuration ( @xmath18ev , configuration ( c@xmath16)@xmath17 ) ) . in its",
    "first formation step the tricarbon antisite is electrically neutral for @xmath19ev .",
    "this value reduces in the next steps .",
    "the defect shows a pronounced lvm spectrum ( cf . tab .",
    "[ tab : anti - clust - lvm ] ) : the five modes reach up to 248.5mev ( 255.1mev in 4h - sic ) .",
    "this is the highest value among all defects we have analyzed .",
    "this is also much higher than the lvms in the intermediate configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : antisite - clust]b right ) obtained by gali _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite at 190 , 172 , 166 , 135 , 133 , and 117mev .",
    "the reason for the high frequency is the short bond length between the adjacent carbon atoms  it ranges from 1.29   for the base of the triangle to 1.55  for the distance between the triangle s apex and the carbon atoms of the enclosing tetrahedron .",
    "the highest mode ( mode 5 ) is a stretching vibration of the short base of the triangle .",
    "mode 4 , which is with 181.3mev still very high , is an asymmetric stretching vibration of the two base atoms against their nearest neighbors from the enclosing tetrahedron . in mode 3",
    "the triangle is stretched , whereas in mode 2 the whole triangle oscillates against the tetrahedron .",
    "mode 1 is a vibration of the carbon atom at the apex against its neighbors .",
    "since the mode 5 is strongly localized at the base of the triangle , one expects a very distinct pattern of isotope shifts similar to the isolated carbon dumbbell . indeed , replacing the nearest neighbors of the triangle with @xmath0c",
    "does not affect this mode at all .",
    "thus the analysis of the isotope shifts for this mode can be restricted to the defect itself .",
    "three frequencies are obtained : 248.5mev for the pure @xmath20c case ( 248.3mev if the carbon atom at the apex is substituted ) , 244.3mev if one of the two carbon atoms of the base is replaced by @xmath0c and 239.8mev in the @xmath0c@xmath21c case .",
    "the corresponding ratios are thus 1.018 and 1.036 , respectively . in 4h - sic , we find the shifted lines at 250.5mev and 246.0mev , with frequency ratios of 1.017 and 1.036 . as discussed above , the energetically lower modes have complex vibrational patterns involving also the nearest neighbor atoms of the defect .",
    "as seen for the dicarbon antisite , only a broadening of the modes and not such a distinct splitting will result from substituting the defect s atoms with @xmath0c .    with the capture of another carbon interstitial the tetracarbon antisite ( c@xmath22)@xmath17 is formed ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : antisite - clust]a right ) . with the dissociation energy of 2.8ev in 3c - sic and 2.9ev in 4h - sic ( cf . tab .",
    "[ tab : cluster - bind ] ) this defect is less stable than ( c@xmath23)@xmath17 , but still tightly bound . in 3c - sic , the central carbon dumbbell is oriented in \\{110}-direction having two additional carbon atoms at each side .",
    "the dumbbell is 1.70  long , the sides of the two isosceles triangles formed by the dumbbell and the additional carbon atoms are 1.38  and 1.44 , respectively . for a fermi - level @xmath24ev and @xmath25ev",
    "the defect is neutral .",
    "the asymmetric geometry is the result of a jahn - teller effect . in the symmetric configuration ,",
    "the defect possesses a doubly degenerate localized state in the band gap .",
    "since in the neutral state this level is occupied , the symmetry is broken by a jahn - teller distortion , which yields an energy gain of about 1ev .",
    "the asymmetric configuration gives rise to a rich lvm spectrum with high - frequency lvms .",
    "we have found 7 lvms above the bulk spectrum with the highest lvm at 223.6mev .",
    "the mode 7 is a stretching vibration of the smaller of the two triangles .",
    "the atom at the apex oscillates against the central dumbbell and the carbon atom of the enclosing tetrahedron .",
    "the mode 6 is an antisymmetric stretching vibration of the two atoms of the central dumbbell atoms against their neighbors .",
    "since the vibration is antisymmetric , the length of the central dumbbell remains constant .",
    "the mode 5 is a stretching vibration of the second triangle with the larger sides , whereas the mode 4 is mainly a stretching vibration of the lateral carbon farther away from the central dumbbell against its neighbor along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "the modes 1 to 3 describe a complex motion of the inner carbon atoms against the enclosing tetrahedron .",
    "we find an at least sixfold isotope splitting of the highest mode and a structureless broadening of the lower modes .",
    "the tetracarbon antisite in 4h - sic shows a simpler lvm spectrum with only five lvms above the bulk phonon spectrum .",
    "this is due to the highly symmetric defect geometry , which is , as mentioned above , not stable in 3c - sic . in the low - symmetry 4h crystal ,",
    "the degeneracy of the defect states is lifted already in the symmetric configuration .",
    "the defect forms a small tetrahedron with a side length of 1.43 , which is enclosed in the carbonic tetrahedron of the crystal lattice .",
    "the highest mode 8 is found at 241mev , followed by three nearly degenerate modes between 200mev and 205mev .",
    "mode 8 is the breathing mode of the tetrahedron .",
    "the modes 5 to 7 are nearly degenerate and can not be separated into vibrations of individual carbon pairs .",
    "the low - frequency modes 1 to 4 show complex vibrational patterns involving all atoms of the defect and the environment . these modes are the least localized . with the partial substitution by @xmath0c , the mode 8 splits into at least four lines separated by about 2mev .",
    "the modes around 200mev broaden into a continuum about 10mev wide .",
    "the calculated vibrational spectra advise a comparison with photo - luminescence experiments .",
    "several defect centers , which have been attributed to intrinsic defects , may be relevant .",
    "there are the alphabet - lines,@xcite the d@xmath4 center,@xcite , the d@xmath1 center@xcite and the recently discovered pl - centers p@xmath2u.@xcite however , the alphabet - lines and the d@xmath4-center possess lvms only in the phonon band gap . hence the defects considered above are not suitable candidates",
    ". we will thus focus on the centers with vibrational modes above the sic bulk phonon spectrum .",
    "the d@xmath1 center shows vibrational modes above the sic bulk spectrum up to 164mev , which are to a large extent polytype independent.@xcite five modes have been described as `` universal '' throughout the polytypes . yet",
    ", a comparison of the spectra for different polytypes indicates that , in fact , a larger number of modes can be regarded as polytype - independent.@xcite the number of reported lvms varies .",
    "five to six modes with tiny peaks in - between have been counted in 3c - sic and up to 12 modes have been observed in 4h - sic.@xcite another important feature is the thermal stability of the center : it persists temperatures up to 1700@xmath3c.@xcite first we summarize our results of ref .   related to the dicarbon antisite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : di - carbon - antisite ] ) and to the dicarbon antisite pair ( sec .",
    "[ sec : clusters - di - carbon ] ) . in this context",
    ", we consider the new information concerning the larger defect clusters .",
    "the dicarbon antisite possesses an lvm pattern compatible with the universal spectrum of the d@xmath1-center.@xcite the high dissociation energy suggests a high thermal stability of this defect . yet , the large number of lvms in the hexagonal polytypes can not be reproduced .",
    "therefore , a larger complex , i.e.  the dicarbon antisite pair , has been proposed by gali _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite the idea was that the combination of the cubic and the hexagonal sites could explain the rich multitude of zero phonon lines ( zpls ) in 4h and 6h - sic .",
    "however , also this model does not explain in full the features of the d@xmath1-center.@xcite especially , it predicts a small splitting of the two highest lvms ( cf . tab .",
    "[ tab : anti - clust - lvm ] ) for all polytypes and all combinations of the site pairs , which is not observed in the d@xmath1 spectrum .",
    "in addition , the number of lvms is still too low to explain the d@xmath1 spectrum in hexagonal polytypes . in an experimental paper,@xcite",
    "it was suggested that the multiple zpls stem from the excited defect states .",
    "yet , the dicarbon antisite model qualitatively reproduces the most robust features of d@xmath1 . in general",
    ", the carbon antisite related defects possess lvms in necessary frequency range .",
    "one can thus expect the dicarbon antisite to be a major building block or precursor of the d@xmath1-center .",
    "however , the dicarbon antisite itself and the dicarbon antisite pair are too small to explain the whole vibrational spectrum .",
    "a larger defect structure seems indispensable , which could also account for the polytype - independent features .    on the other hand ,",
    "the interstitial clusters as the model for the d@xmath1-center can be ruled out .",
    "none of the clusters shows a proper lvm spectrum . for the di - interstitials ,",
    "a few lvms above 160mev exist , as well as a mode around 130mev .",
    "the highest lvm has the tendency to drop with growing cluster size . therefore",
    ", adding further interstitials would not improve the situation . on the contrary ,",
    "the carbon - rich environment due to the incorporation of antisites provides the diamond - like spectrum of the d@xmath1-center .",
    "this is seen for the clusters at a single antisite and the di - carbon antisite aggregates : the trapping of further carbon interstitials yields very short carbon - carbon bonds with high - frequency lvms above 200mev , whereas a clustering of dicarbon antisites results in a dropping of the highest mode , but also an increase of the number of lvms .",
    "the combination of both processes may thus explain the lvm spectrum of the d@xmath1-center .",
    "further intrinsic defects with high - frequency lvms are the five centers labeled p@xmath2 t , which were found in electron - irradiated 6h - sic.@xcite an electron beam with the energy below the silicon displacement threshold , but at a very high dose of @xmath27  @xmath28 was used .",
    "the five centers possess separate zpls with lvms at 133mev and 180mev .",
    "the p - center is the most stable and persists annealing temperatures of 1000@xmath3c .",
    "isotope - enriched pl - measurements with a @xmath0c incorporation of 30% were performed .",
    "the higher lvm splits into three lines , with the isotope - undoped line shifted to about 175mev and 171mev .",
    "this results in frequency ratios ( averaged over the five different centers ) of 1.020@xmath29 and 1.043@xmath29 .",
    "this isotope splitting has been interpreted as a vibration of a carbon - carbon dumbbell . for this defect",
    "the stretching vibration shows a threefold isotope splitting .",
    "the experimental results are in agreement with the square root dependence on the reduced mass",
    ". the ratios of the vibrational frequencies of a @xmath20c@xmath21c and a @xmath0c@xmath21c dumbbell to frequency of the the pure @xmath20c case are 1.020 and 1.041 , respectively .",
    "a simple shift to 128mev has been observed for the lower lvm .",
    "this yields a frequency ratio of 1.034@xmath30 . for the interpretation of this mode",
    "the oscillation of the carbon atom against its silicon neighbors in a si@xmath2c@xmath2si molecule has been considered , which gives a frequency ratio of 1.033 .",
    "this underlies a carbon split - interstitial model proposed for the p@xmath2 t centers .    according to our calculations , the split - interstitials ( sec .",
    "[ sec : carb - split - interst ] ) and the dicarbon antisite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : di - carbon - antisite ] ) possess vibrational modes close to the lvms of the p@xmath2 t centers .",
    "the originally suggested split - interstitial@xcite has a single lvm above the sic bulk spectrum in the symmetric case ( 219.2mev in the charge state @xmath31 ( ref .  ) and 183mev in the neutral charge state@xcite in 3c - sic , 197mev at the hexagonal site in 4h - sic@xcite ) .",
    "this picture , however , changes for the energetically more favorable tilted configuration . in this case two",
    "( three ) lvms at the cubic ( hexagonal ) site in good agreement with the values of the p@xmath2 t centers are found ( sec .",
    "[ sec : carb - split - interst ] ) .",
    "also the values of the frequency ratios for the high - frequency mode are in excellent agreement .",
    "this finding supports the split - interstitial model of evans _ _ et al.__@xcite yet , some issues still have to be resolved : first , the ratios of the isotope shifts for the low - frequency lvms ( tab .",
    "[ tab : iso - csp ] ) are smaller than that of the p@xmath2 t centers , especially in 3c - sic .",
    "second , the shifted frequencies and the ratios depend on the site of the substituted carbon atom .",
    "third , two very close low - frequency modes are obtained at the hexagonal site .",
    "all these facts are not evident from the experimental data . however , the spectrum is very complex and difficult to resolve,@xcite hence it is not unlikely that further weak peaks close to the reported vibrational modes may exist .",
    "a further difficulty is the high mobility of the carbon interstitial,@xcite which is not compatible with the high annealing temperature of @xmath32c of the centers .",
    "two explanations are possible : first , the carbon interstitials are trapped in interstitial clusters,@xcite and re - emitted in the annealing process .",
    "if this is the case , it should be possible to anneal out the p@xmath2 t centers at lower temperatures , but at longer annealing times .",
    "second , the low - energy irradiation with a very high flux produces a large amount of carbon interstitials , which may not completely annihilate with vacancies during the annealing .",
    "the mobile interstitials migrate away from vacancies and maintain a metastable high concentration after the cooling .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the finding that the intensity especially of the p - center drops very slowly outside the irradiated area .",
    "the dicarbon antisite has been discussed as a possible model by gali _ _ et al.__@xcite the mode 5 of ( c@xmath33)@xmath17 ( cf . tab .",
    "[ tab : anti - clust - lvm ] ) has been associated with the high - frequency lvm of the p@xmath2 t centers . due to the localized character of this vibration of the carbon dumbbell",
    ", we observe a threefold isotope splitting , and the corresponding frequency ratios indeed agree very well with the experimental results .",
    "the modes 3 and 4 have been associated with the low - frequency lvm ( the high - spin case has been considered in ref .  , where these two modes are degenerate ) .",
    "however , this assignment bears some difficulties .",
    "first , the energy difference between the symmetric high - spin case and the jahn - teller distorted low - spin case is too small to uniquely determine the true ground state configuration ( 80mev in 3c - sic and 120mev in 4h - sic in favor of the high - spin state).@xcite second , due to the lower crystal symmetry in 4h - sic the modes 3 and 4 are non - degenerate even in the high - spin case.@xcite with its hexagonal - cubic - cubic stacking sequence the polytype 6h - sic has a similarly low symmetry , thus it is likely that in 6h - sic the modes 3 and 4 of the defect should also be observed independently .",
    "an experimental verification in pl measurements is possible by imposing a uniaxial pressure on a non - enriched crystal .",
    "the pressure favors the distorted configuration and thus the splitting of the modes 3 and 4 . analyzing the isotope shifts of the modes 3 and 4 , gali _ et al .",
    "_ substituted the two dumbbell atoms with @xmath0c.@xcite hereby a twofold splitting of the degenerate mode ( modes 3 and 4 ) was observed , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , the inclusion of the nearest neighbor atoms in the isotope analysis has a significant impact on these modes . in the jahn - teller distorted configuration ,",
    "the two lines split into two groups with six shifted lines in each ( cf .",
    "[ fig : icspsi - isospectrum ] ) . in the symmetric high - spin case the groups overlap and",
    "result in seven lines , which can not be separated .",
    "thus this model can not explain the twofold splitting of the lower mode of the p@xmath2 t center .",
    "the mode 2 was declared invisible by gali _ _ et al.__@xcite due to the defect s @xmath34 symmetry",
    ". however , in the jahn - teller distorted configuration the symmetry reduces to @xmath35 and in the hexagonal polytypes to @xmath36 .",
    "similar arguments refer to isolated molecules,@xcite which is not relevant in case of the dicarbon antisite . yet",
    ", the dicarbon antisite could explain the thermal stability of the p@xmath2 t centers of up to 1000@xmath3c without referring to the cluster formation .",
    "the defect , however , needs carbon antisites as a prerequisite for its formation .",
    "since the samples were irradiated with low - energy electrons , a decent concentration of antisites has to be created by kinetic processes , before the dicarbon antisite can form .",
    "the five different zpls may originate from the various locations of the defect ( either the dicarbon antisite or the split - interstitial ) at inequivalent sites in 6h - sic .",
    "another explanation may be the excitation of the defect states in the band gap .",
    "the experiments have been performed with excitation energies below the sic band gap,@xcite hence it is likely that the bound excitons were formed by the excitation of an occupied defect state and not by trapping a free exciton . the energy of the zpl may thus depend on the energetic position of the defect level in the band gap , which may vary with the location of the defect at a cubic or a hexagonal site .",
    "also the generation of excited exciton states should be considered .",
    "this may be clarified with the measurement of relaxation times .",
    "the analysis performed in ref .   of the centers spatial distribution in the irradiated region and its boundary",
    "may also give an indication of the correlations between the various centers .    both models ( dicarbon antisite and carbon split - interstitial ) show properties that allow to consider them as candidates for the p@xmath2 t centers .",
    "however , both have difficulties that have to be resolved . among the other defects that we studied , neither the interstitial clusters nor the antisite - related clusters",
    "can explain the p@xmath2 t centers .",
    "either the lvm pattern is incompatible with experiment or the isotope splitting .",
    "considering all these results , the split - interstitial appears to be the simplest and the most likely interpretation .      besides the p@xmath2 t centers evans _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have found a center with a high - frequency mode at 246.6mev which has been labeled the u - center .",
    "further modes have not been identified in the spectra sofar . in @xmath0c enriched material two shifted modes at 242.1mev and 237.4mev are observed , with the frequency ratios of 1.019 and 1.039 , respectively .",
    "it has been speculated that the threefold splitting again originates from the carbon - carbon dumbbell vibrations .",
    "however , such a high vibrational frequency had not been observed for a carbon - based defect before . also the frequency ratios do not perfectly fit the square root dependence on the mass ratios .",
    "lvms with such high energies have been earlier identified as hydrogen or deuterium ( c@xmath2h and c@xmath2d ) vibrational modes at 369mev and 274mev , respectively@xcite .",
    "therefore evans _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite suggested that hydrogen may be involved in this defect center .",
    "yet , the calculations for the tricarbon antisite ( c@xmath23)@xmath17 and the tetracarbon antisite ( c@xmath22)@xmath17 ( cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : tri - tetra - carbon ] ) show that lvms up to 250mev should be possible for purely carbon - based defects . for the tricarbon antisite ,",
    "the highest mode at 248.5mev is a strongly localized stretching vibration that shows a threefold isotope splitting with frequency ratios ( 1.018 and 1.036 ) close to that of the u - center .",
    "thus the relation of the u - center to the carbon - carbon dumbbell is plausible . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tri - tetra - carbon ] , the vibrations of the energetically lower modes of the tricarbon antisite are very complex and involve several carbon atoms , resulting in a strong isotope broadening of these lines . in the complex spectra presented in ref .  , additional low - frequency lines may be hidden .",
    "if the further lower modes of the u - center were found , an identification of the u - center with the tricarbon antisite would be a good possibility .",
    "the high dissociation energy of 4.8ev in 3c - sic and 5.8ev in 4h - sic can also explain the thermal stability of the u - center , which has been observed up to 1300@xmath3c .",
    "et al.__@xcite also discussed the spatial distribution of the u - centers . directly after irradiation the center has been observed , if at all , in the periphery of the irradiated region , and inside the region only after annealing above 1000@xmath3c .",
    "the annealing behavior is completely different to that of the p@xmath2 t centers .",
    "this finding supports our interpretation of the preceding section that the split - interstitials are responsible for the p@xmath2 t centers , since the u - center and the p@xmath2 t centers must have a different origin .",
    "if we identified the p@xmath2 t centers with the dicarbon antisite and the u - center with the tricarbon antisite , the p@xmath2 t centers should coexist in the same region , which apparently is not the case .",
    "the split - interstitial and the antisite defects are , however , fundamentally different defect configurations .",
    "the interpretation of the dicarbon antisite as a building block of the d@xmath1-center ( cf .",
    "[ sec : d2-center ] and ref .  ) implies that also the tricarbon antisite should then be a precursor of the d@xmath1-center .",
    "if tricarbon antisite is related to the u - center , this should be observed in the experimental data .",
    "indeed , the u - center vanishes at 1300@xmath3c , whereas the d@xmath1-center rises above these temperatures.@xcite careful annealing studies of the intrinsic pl - centers could help to clarify the formation behavior of the various defects .      in diamond ,",
    "di- , tri- and tetra - interstitials have been considered by _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "goss _ _ et al.__@xcite have found similar configurations to ( c@xmath9)@xmath33 , ( c@xmath33)@xmath37 , ( c@xmath9)@xmath23 and ( c@xmath9)@xmath22 . the defects possess a very rich vibrational spectrum above the diamond bulk phonon limit at 164mev .",
    "the di - interstitials show six lvms up to 228mev ( @xmath38 similar to ( c@xmath9)@xmath33 ) and seven lvms up to 243mev ( @xmath38 similar to ( c@xmath33)@xmath37 ) .",
    "the hexagonal di - interstitial thus shows a much higher frequency than @xmath38 based on two split - interstitials , which is not so clearly visible in 3c - sic .",
    "the tri - interstitial @xmath39 shows 11 lvms up to 216mev and the tetra - interstitial @xmath40 12 lvms up to 197mev .",
    "it is observed that the frequencies are generally much higher than in sic due to the shorter bond lengths of diamond .",
    "the overall behavior is very similar : the highest lvm goes down with increase of the number of interstitial atoms , a feature that is also observed for the interstitial clusters in sic ( cf . tab .",
    "[ tab : int - clust - lvm ] ) .",
    "the high number of lvms has been obtained for the ring of dicarbon antisites ( ( c@xmath33)@xmath17)@xmath22 , with all dumbbells enclosed by a pure carbon shell . for this defect 11 lvms",
    "are counted instead of five for ( c@xmath9)@xmath22 , whereas the highest lvm does not differ considerably compared to ( c@xmath9)@xmath22 . thus for the defects spanning several lattice sites only the number of lvms appears to depend on the number of carbon atoms involved .",
    "the highest lvm frequency is determined by the crystal lattice .",
    "another similarity of sic and diamond is the increase of the dissociation energy per atom with the cluster size .",
    "the cluster dissociation energy is defined in ref .   as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the cluster size . for the di - interstitials",
    ", this definition gives the same values as listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : cluster - bind ] . for the tri- and tetra - interstitial",
    "we obtain @xmath43ev and @xmath44ev , respectively .",
    "the increase of the dissociation energy can be attributed to the larger number of @xmath45-hybridized carbon atoms in the defect .    the comparison with diamond shows that defects with a high vibrational frequency ( tricarbon and tetracarbon antisite ) may exist in sic .",
    "since they are confined at a single lattice site , they are only weakly influenced by the surrounding lattice .",
    "the short carbon - carbon bonds give rise to high - frequency lvms as in diamond .",
    "we investigated the energetic , structural and vibrational properties of small carbon clusters in 3c and 4h - sic .",
    "we considered two different types of aggregates .",
    "one are clusters of carbon interstitials , where we investigated clusters with up to four interstitials .",
    "the other type is a collection of carbon atoms at carbon antisite positions .",
    "clusters comprised of up to four carbon atoms at a silicon site were found . due to their short carbon - carbon bonds and their light carbon constituents",
    "they reveal vibrational modes well above the sic bulk phonon spectrum .",
    "we analyzed the vibrational signatures as well as the isotope shifts of the defects by _ ab initio _ calculations and compared them with the photoluminescence centers p@xmath2 t , u and d@xmath1 .",
    "as the origin of the p@xmath2 t centers the carbon split - interstitial and the dicarbon antisite were discussed .",
    "both defects possess lvms at appropriate frequencies .",
    "the isotope shifts of the high - frequency mode of the p@xmath2 t centers are in good agreement with the results for both defects . yet",
    ", the two - fold isotope splitting of the low - frequency mode can not be explained by the dicarbon antisite , which shows an at least sixfold splitting for the modes in that frequency range . for the split - interstitial the isotope splitting of the low - frequency mode",
    "is compatible with experiment .",
    "none of the other interstitial and antisite clusters showed such a clear isotope splitting as observed for the p@xmath2 t centers .",
    "the highly mobile carbon interstitials can aggregate and form stable carbon interstitial clusters .",
    "the signatures of di- , tri- and tetra - interstitials were presented .",
    "the most stable form of the di - interstitial is the hexagonal di - interstitial ( c@xmath33)@xmath37 .",
    "this defect possesses an lvm spectrum which is practically independent of the polytype and in 4h - sic also insensitive to variations of the configuration .",
    "the highest lvm of interstitial clusters reduces with the number of split - interstitials involved  a behavior that is consistent with similar defects in diamond .",
    "only very compact interstitial clusters as ( ( c@xmath33)@xmath37)@xmath33 can have high - frequency lvms .",
    "carbon aggregates may also affect the annealing processes of intrinsic defects .",
    "they can trap mobile carbon - interstitials and re - emit them again at higher temperatures and thus provide the constituents for further stable defect centers . the apparent contradiction in the identification of the thermally stable p@xmath2 t centers with a highly mobile split - interstitial",
    "may be lifted in this way .",
    "also the carbon antisite may trap carbon interstitials .",
    "this may result in very compact defect clusters with lvms up to 255mev , which was obtained for ( c@xmath23)@xmath17 in 4h - sic .",
    "consequently , defect centers like the u - center may be entirely carbon - based .",
    "also complexes of neighboring antisites may form .",
    "examples are the pair of dicarbon antisites ( ( c@xmath33)@xmath17)@xmath33 and the ring of dicarbon antisites ( ( c@xmath33)@xmath17)@xmath22 .",
    "these defects behave similar to the split - interstitial clusters , yet they show a richer spectrum .",
    "the relevance of these complexes for the d@xmath1 center was discussed .",
    "the compact antisite clusters cause lvms well above 200mev , whereas the complexes spanning several defect sites have energetically lower , but richer spectra .",
    "thus for the d@xmath1 center an extended defect which grows on the dicarbon antisite as core structure may be the origin .",
    "this implies that simple defects like the dicarbon antisite should be observed experimentally as a precursor of the d@xmath1 center .",
    "the centers p@xmath2u and d@xmath1 are yet the only experimentally observed intrinsic defects with lvms above the sic bulk phonon spectrum .",
    "we have presented various stable defect configurations with high - frequency lvms .",
    "this indicates that probably a number of new defect centers shall be discovered in future experiments ."
