    "one of the main problems of the standard model is the strong violation of cp invariance due to non - perturbative effects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in general ,",
    "qcd effects generates the term in the lagrangian such as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the qcd gauge coupling constant , @xmath2 is the field strength of the gluon , and @xmath3 . experimentally @xmath4 must be smaller than about @xmath5 , but in the standard model there seems to be no theoretical reasons that @xmath4 must be so small .",
    "this is the well - known strong cp problem . as a solution to the strong cp problem , peccei and quinn @xcite introduced anomalous global u(1 ) symmetry , which we denote u(1)@xmath6 .",
    "when this u(1)@xmath6 is broken spontaneously , there appears a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson called axion @xcite .",
    "the axion dynamically cancels the @xmath4-term effectively , and no strong cp violation is observed in true vacuum . in order not to contradict with terrestrial experiments , astrophysical @xcite and cosmological arguments @xcite , the breaking scale of pq symmetry @xmath7 should lie in the range @xmath8 . if @xmath7 is close to this upper bound , the axion is an interesting candidate for the cold dark matter .    on the other hand ,",
    "another problem in the standard model is the quadratic divergence of the radiative correction to the higgs mass . in the standard model , the mass of the higgs is not protected by any symmetry , and",
    "hence naturally the higgs boson is expected to obtain the mass of the cut - off scale .",
    "thus to obtain hierarchically small mass scale down to the weak scale requires unnatural fine - tuning .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is the most motivated solution to this problem , since susy protects the mass of scalar fields and the weak scale becomes stable against radiative correction . from cosmological points of view , susy also provides interesting candidates for the dark matter . due to the @xmath9-parity conservation ,",
    "under which standard model particles have the charge @xmath10 and their superpartners have @xmath11 , the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "so if the lsp is neutralino or gravitino , they are the dark matter candidates",
    ".    therefore , it seems reasonable to combine these two paradigms .",
    "in fact , axion models are easily extended to implement susy .",
    "as we will see , in susy extensions of the axion models , many non - trivial cosmological consequences arise . in susy axion models , both the scalar partner of the axion , _ saxion _ , and the fermionic superpartner of the axion , _ axino _ ,",
    "have significant effects on cosmology .",
    "but there have not been many studies which treat both of them in spite of their importance @xcite .",
    "moreover , these earlier works were based on specific models and only the restricted parameter regions were investigated . in this paper , we investigate all possible mass range of the saxion and corresponding various cosmological bounds . our results are easily applied to any axion models with slight modifications , and hence provide general cosmological constraints .",
    "furthermore , since the saxion and axino densities depend on the reheating temperature @xmath12 after inflation , we can obtain constraints on @xmath12 .",
    "the important result is that the upper bound on @xmath12 becomes more stringent due to the late - decaying saxion and axino , than that from the usual gravitino problem .",

    "the axion is the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson which appears due to the spontaneous breaking of pq symmetry .",
    "the axion obtains a mass from the effect of quantum anomaly , but this contribution is very small .",
    "it is estimated as @xmath14 .    in susy extensions of axion models , the axion field forms supermultiplet , which contains a scalar partner ( saxion ) and fermionic superpartner ( axino ) of the axion @xcite .",
    "the saxion mass is expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass ( @xmath15 ) . on the other hand",
    "the axino mass somewhat depends on models , but generically can be as large as @xmath15 .",
    "although the interactions of both particles with standard model particles are suppressed by the pq scale @xmath7 , they may cause significant effects on cosmology as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] .",
    "in susy models , superpotentials must satisfy the holomorphy . when the real u(1)@xmath16 symmetry is combined with the holomorphic property of the superpotential , it is extended to complex u(1 ) symmetry , which inevitably includes scale transformation @xcite .",
    "the invariance under the scale transformation means the existence of a flat direction along which the scalar field does not feel the scalar potential .",
    "the saxion corresponds to such a flat direction of the potential .",
    "but susy breaking effects lift the flat direction and the saxion receives a mass of order @xmath15",
    ". still holds @xcite .",
    "] the saxion field can develop to large field value during inflation , and begins to oscillate around its minimum when the hubble parameter @xmath17 becomes comparable to the saxion mass @xmath18 .",
    "in general such coherent oscillation of the saxion field has large energy density and hence its late decay may have significant effects on cosmology @xcite .",
    "as an example , let us consider a model with the following superpotential : @xmath19 where the superfields @xmath20 and @xmath21 have the pq charges @xmath22 respectively .",

    "the potential minimum appears at @xmath32 , but the initial amplitude of the saxion remains undetermined .",
    "in general , if the saxion remains light during inflation , the field value may naturally take the value of the order of the reduced planck scale @xmath33 .",
    "but the initial amplitude can be suppressed by introducing the hubble - induced mass terms , which are induced by the saxion coupling with inflaton field through supergravity effect , given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath31 constants . if either @xmath37 or @xmath36 are negative , the @xmath38 or @xmath21 field roll away to @xmath39 during inflation .",

    "this simple model provides one realization of the scenario for the initial saxion amplitude @xmath46 to be @xmath47 . for the case of @xmath48 ,",
    "the cosmological constraints become much more stringent than the case of @xmath49 , and hence hereafter we consider only the latter case .    for this scenario to work , the hubble parameter during inflation @xmath50 should be smaller than @xmath47 , since otherwise the large hubble mass term during inflation takes the all fields to the origin .",
    "once they are trapped at the origin , the saxion has unsuppressed interaction with particles in thermal bath and get a large thermal mass , which results in further trap of of the saxion at the origin .",
    "thus , the oscillation epoch is significantly delayed  @xcite .",
    "because delayed oscillation only makes the cosmological saxion problems worse , we do not consider such a case . on the other hand",
    ", the axion field has isocurvature perturbations with amplitude @xmath51 during inflation  @xcite , which leads to a constraint on @xmath50 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the initial misalignment angle of the axion , @xmath54 denotes the density parameter of the nonrelativistic matter and @xmath55 is the present hubble parameter in units of 100  km / sec / mpc .",
    "here we have used the observational constraint that the ratio of the isocurvature perturbation to the adiabatic one should be less than about @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "thus , as long as we stick to @xmath57 , the requirement @xmath58 is in fact valid from cosmological point of view .",
    "although we have presented a specific model above , the dynamics of the saxion does not depend on axion models much , once the initial amplitude and the mass of the saxion are fixed .",

    "now let us estimate the saxion abundance .",

    ", the saxions are thermalized through these scattering processes and the abundance is determined as  @xcite @xmath71 for @xmath72 , this ratio is suppressed by the factor @xmath73 .",
    "the result is @xmath74 here we have assumed that thermally produced saxions become nonrelativistic before they decay .",
    "this assumption is valid for the parameter regions we are interested in .",
    "we can see that the contribution from coherent oscillation is proportional to @xmath75 while that from thermal production is proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "thus for small @xmath7 thermal production may be dominant .",

    "these photon produced in the decay also bring about cosmological difficulty .    in the dfsz axion model , the pq scalar has tree level coupling with the ordinary quarks and leptons .",

    "moreover , the decay into the muon pair ( see below ) gives the same order of the decay rate for @xmath127 mev ( decay into mesons are kinematically forbidden for @xmath128 mev ) .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we neglect the effects of saxion decay into mesons for @xmath129  gev .    the saxion coupling with leptons is not suppressed for the dfsz axion model , which gives the decay rate @xmath130",
    "thus we can see that the saxion decay into heavier fermions is enhanced , as long as it is kinematically allowed .",
    "in fact , the decay into fermions may be the dominant mode for some mass region even if @xmath131 .    in the ksvz model , the decay of the saxion into quarks and leptons",
    "is suppressed because the saxion does not directly couple with them .",

    "the saxion decays into ordinary particles either radiatively or hadronically . if the hadronic decay occurs at early epoch ( @xmath158sec ) , the main effect on bbn is @xmath159 conversion caused by injected pions , which results in helium overproduction . at later epoch , photo- and hadro - dissociation processes of light elements take place efficiently .",
    "when @xmath94 is the dominant decay mode , the branching ratios into radiation or hadrons are small .",
    "nevertheless , even a small fraction of the energy density of the saxion which goes into radiation or hadrons may have impacts on bbn .",
    "in particular , if hadronic decay modes are open , the constraint is very stringent .    the constraints from photo-(hadro-)dissociation are approximately written as @xmath160 for radiative decay , and @xmath161 for hadronic decay , where @xmath162 and @xmath163 denote the radiative and hadronic branching ratios , respectively ( here @xmath162 includes the hadronic decay modes ) .",
    "note that if the injected photon energy ( which is equal to the half of the saxion mass ) is smaller than the threshold energy to destroy the light elements especially @xmath143he , which is typically @xmath13 mev , the photo- and hadro - dissociation constraints are much weakened .",
    "in particular bbn constraints are neglected for @xmath164 mev , which corresponds to the threshold energy for the process @xmath165 .      the saxion with lifetime @xmath166",
    "sec @xmath167  sec may affect the blackbody spectrum of cmb . since preserving the blackbody spectrum requires the photon number - violating processes such as double - compton scattering , to maintain thermal equilibrium between photons and electrons , photons injected in the decay distort the cmb spectrum at @xmath168sec when the double - compton scattering becomes inefficient .",
    "the distortion is characterized by the chemical potential @xmath169 at @xmath170  sec when the energy transfer by the compton scattering is efficient , and compton @xmath171-parameter at later epoch , which characterizes the deviation of the cmb spectrum from thermal distribution due to the inverse compton scattering by high energy electrons .",

    "the saxion also has the mass comparable to the gravitino .",
    "the stability of the saxion is not ensured by the @xmath9-parity , but since its decay rate is suppressed by the pq scale @xmath7 , the saxion lifetime can exceed the present age of the universe . if this is the case , the saxion can be the dark matter .",

    "[ fig : mstr_14 ] ) .    to summarize , for @xmath267  tev , the axino is a good dark matter candidate for @xmath90  gev , and the axion may be dark matter candidate for @xmath275  gev .      for larger @xmath277",
    ", the saxion decay mode into susy particles opens .",
    "then the lsp is assumed to be the lightest neutralino . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lsp ] , the abundance is given by eq .",
    "( [ ntlsp ] ) if the decay occurs after the freeze - out of the lsp . for the neutralino which has small annihilation cross section , very low reheating temperature is needed to obtain the correct abundance of the dark matter as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : mstr_10]-[fig : mstr_14 ] .",
    "however , for the neutralino with larger annihilation cross section such as wino- or higgsino - like lsp , the abundance may be significantly reduced and they can become the dark matter independent of the reheating temperature  @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ ntlsp ] ) , which describes that the resulting abundance is bounded from above .",
    "thus for the saxion mass larger than 1  tev , these non - thermally produced neutralinos may be dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath152 is larger than the freeze - out temperature of the lsp @xmath278 , the standard thermal relic scenario holds and the saxion has no impact on cosmology unless it dominates the universe before the decay .",
    "if the saxion once dominates the universe , it must not decay into axions mainly , since otherwise @xmath148 holds at bbn and contradicts with the observation .",
    "therefore , for @xmath235  tev , the lightest neutralino produced either thermally or non - thermally is likely dark matter depending on @xmath60 and @xmath7 .",
    "of course , the axion is also a good candidate for the dark matter for @xmath279gev .",
    "we have seen that for almost all the mass range of the gravitino , the reheating temperature is severely constrained . however , for an ultra - light gravitino with mass of the order of 1 - 10  ev , gravitinos are thermalized and their abundance is sufficiently lower than the dark matter abundance , and hence the reheating temperature is not constrained from gravitino overproduction .",
    "thus thermal leptogenesis using right - handed neutrino @xcite , which requires @xmath280  gev , may be possible .    in susy axion model",
    ", the saxion oscillation also contributes to the present dark matter density as given in eqs .",
    "( [ rhostos ] ) and ( [ rhostr ] ) .",
    "we should ensure that this contribution does not exceeds the present matter density of the universe . from eq .",
    "( [ rhostos ] ) , @xmath255 is bounded as @xmath281 thus for @xmath282  gev , the saxion abundance from coherent oscillation is smaller than that of the dark matter",
    ". however , we should be aware that thermally produced saxion and axino abundances are comparable to that of the gravitino for @xmath283 if @xmath284 , since both are thermalized in the early universe .",
    "thus constraint on the gravitino mass may become more stringent by a factor of two , if thermal leptogenesis is assumed to work . in fig .",

    "we have investigated the cosmological constraints on supersymmetric axion models which are motivated from particle physics point of view .",
    "it is found that the presence of the saxion and the axino makes it rather difficult to construct a viable cosmological scenario which is free from any contradiction with observations . in particular , in almost all range of the gravitino mass ( which is assumed to be the same order as the saxion mass ) , the strict upper bound on the reheating temperature is imposed , and it is more stringent than the bound from the usual gravitino problem [ figs .

    "fig : mstr_10]-[fig : mstr_14 ] ] .",

    "the axion is a good candidate for the cold dark matter , although the axino or gravitino dark matter is also viable for some parameter regions .",
    "the obtained stringent bound on the reheating temperature has some implications on the baryogenesis scenarios .",

    "the affleck - dine baryogenesis scenario @xcite can work well even for such a low - reheating temperature @xcite , except for the case of gauge - mediated susy breaking models for small @xmath15 , where the affleck - dine mechanism may suffer from q - ball formation @xcite . on the other hand , for an ultra - light gravitino mass @xmath290  ev",
    ", thermal leptogenesis is still possible . here",

    "perhaps this is the smallest value expected from naturalness , and hence our bounds presented in this paper should be regarded as conservative , which means our constraints can not be relaxed without significant changes in the cosmological scenario , such as additional late - time entropy production .",
    "finally we comment on the detectable signature of the susy axion models .",
    "if the saxion mass is around a few mev , its decay into electron - positron pair and their annihilation may be observed as the 511 kev line from the galactic center .",
    "such line gamma photons are actually observed  @xcite . however , in order to explain the observed flux , huge entropy production that dilute the saxion density is needed  @xcite .",
