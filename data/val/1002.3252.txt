    "during the last decade , a huge effort has been made to understand the conduction properties of quantum systems that consist of only a few discrete levels .",
    "spurred by feynman s vision of `` plenty of room at the bottom '' @xcite , it has e.g.  been proposed to use single molecules as elements of future electronic circuits @xcite . although this task is far from being accomplished , molecular electronics already became an established field @xcite .",
    "apart from their technological promises , conducting molecules may also serve as tools for the implementation of fundamental physical phenomena .",
    "one example is the intriguing effect of tunnel suppression by the purely coherent influence of an ac field @xcite , which is stable even in the presence of coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "coherent destruction of tunneling leaves its fingerprints in the transport characteristics of laser - driven molecular wires , where an ac field may suppress the current and its fluctuations @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "molecular wires share many features with quantum dots .",
    "in particular , the electronic structure of both systems consists of discrete states . owing to this fact ,",
    "coherently coupled quantum dots may be considered as `` artificial molecules '' , despite the fact that their energy scales are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of real molecules . for roughly one decade",
    ", the state of the art has been to couple just two quantum dots coherently @xcite , while triple quantum dots have been realized only recently @xcite .",
    "both double quantum dots @xcite and triple quantum dots @xcite can be constructed such that electrons coming from the source may proceed on two different paths towards the drain . there",
    "they interfere constructively or destructively , depending on the setup and a possible flux enclosed by the interfering paths .",
    "moreover , there exist dark states which are superpositions of states that are decoupled from the drain and , thus , block the electron transport @xcite .",
    "such blockade may be resolved by excitations with proper ac fields @xcite which also create spin correlations between transported electrons @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the conduction properties of a triple quantum dot in ring configuration as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "a penetrating flux allows the operation as aharonov - bohm interferometer .",
    "we focus on the influence of a gate voltage that allows shifting of the levels of dot  2 out of resonance .",
    "the intuitive expectation is that for strong detuning , the two other dots govern the transport process , such that the triple quantum dot behaves like a double quantum dot .",
    "while this is indeed the case for the current , electrons temporarily trapped in dot  2 may cause coulomb blockade and , thus , interrupt the transport such that the electron flow becomes avalanche - like .",
    "this is reflected in the zero - frequency component of the current - current correlation function which significantly exceeds the value for a poisson process . with this criterion ,",
    "avalanche - like transport has been predicted for quantum dots coupled to a harmonic mode @xcite , multi - level quantum dots @xcite , triple quantum dots in the kondo regime @xcite , and also when destructive interference effects strongly suppress the current @xcite .",
    "an established theoretical tool for characterizing such correlated transport is full counting statistics @xcite which provides the complete information about the distribution of the transported charge in terms of the corresponding cumulants . for a markovian master equation as employed below , it is possible to express these cumulants as derivatives of a particular eigenvalue of the liouville operator augmented by a counting variable @xcite .",
    "generally , this requires the computation of derivatives of high order .",
    "as soon as one has to rely on a numerical treatment , practical calculations may represent a formidable task .",
    "recently , flindt _ et al .",
    "_ have found a way to circumvent this difficulty @xcite .",
    "based on rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , they derived a scheme that allows one to recursively compute the full counting statistics .",
    "we use this approach for our numerical solution .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce a system - lead hamiltonian and derive a master equation formalism for the computation of the full counting statistics .",
    "the numerical results for the current and the zero - frequency noise , presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] , provide information about the super - poissonian nature of the transport process . in section  [ sec : limits ] , we derive for the cumulants up to fourth order analytical expressions valid in the low - bias regime .",

    "the electrons possess two paths for traveling from the source to the drain .",
    "thus , interference plays a role .",
    "this interference can be controlled by a magnetic flux @xmath16 penetrating the ring . we capture this by the replacement @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the flux quantum .",
    "note that since we consider only spinless electrons , the effect of an associated zeeman splitting is ignored .",
    "nevertheless , the flux dependence of the current provides information about the relevance of interference effects .",

    "the tilde denotes the interaction picture with respect to the uncoupled hamiltonian , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "we proceed by inserting the dot - lead tunnel hamiltonian and evaluate the trace over the lead states . in order to cope with the interaction picture , we decompose the resulting master equation into the eigenstates @xmath36 of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the corresponding eigenenergy .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the @xmath39-integration , which yields a delta function and a principal value term . neglecting the latter , we obtain for the density matrix elements the equation of motion @xmath40 with the incoherent dot - lead tunneling given by @xmath41 where the leads now are labeled by the number @xmath42 of the dot to which they are attached .",
    "electron tunneling from the leads to the dots is described by the explicitly written terms , while the replacement in the last line yields the terms for tunneling from the dots to the leads .",
    "the solution of the master equation contains the full information about the state of the central system and provides all corresponding expectation values .",
    "however , we are interested in the statistics of the charge transported after the initial preparation , which is an expectation value of lead operators . therefore we have to generalize the master equation formalism by introducing a counting variable which allows one to keep track of this information .",
    "the counting variable @xmath43 is defined via the moment generating function @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electron number operator of the right lead , while the angular brackets refer to the expectation value at time @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47th derivative of @xmath48 with respect to @xmath49 at @xmath50 obviously is the moment @xmath51 of the electron distribution in the right lead .",
    "the cumulants of the distribution are defined as the corresponding derivatives of @xmath52 . for a markov process",
    ", they eventually become linear in time .",
    "their time - derivatives at large times , @xmath53 are the stationary current cumulants and characterize the transport .",
    "the first and the second cumulant , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are essentially the current @xmath56 and its zero - frequency noise @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "we start again from the full density operator @xmath60 , but now multiply it with the operator @xmath61 before tracing out the leads .",

    "the superoperator @xmath71 describes tunneling from dot 3 to the right lead , while @xmath72 corresponds to the reversed process .",
    "we proceed as for the derivation of the master equation and decompose the current superoperators into the eigenstates of @xmath37 which yields @xmath74    in the long - time limit , the dynamics of @xmath75 is governed by the eigenvalue of @xmath76 with the largest real part , denoted as @xmath77 .",
    "we assume that @xmath77 can be uniquely identified by its limit @xmath78 , i.e. , it corresponds to the stationary solution of the liouvillian @xmath79 .",

    "multiplication with the corresponding left eigenvector @xmath89 must correspond to computing the trace .",
    "this becomes clear when one notes that the liouvillian is trace conserving , i.e.@xmath90 for any operator @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , @xmath92 is the projector on the subspace perpendicular to @xmath93 . in this subspace ,",
    "the liouvillian possesses the pseudo - inverse @xmath94 .",
    "applying it to any operator , i.e.  computing @xmath95 , is equivalent to solving the linear equation @xmath96 under the constraint @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , we obtain for the first two cumulants , which are the current and the zero - frequency noise , the known expressions @xcite @xmath98",
    "an intuitive picture for the transport properties as a function of the gate voltage can be provided for the limiting cases in which the detuning of dot  2 is either much larger or much smaller than the inter - dot tunneling : in the limit @xmath99 , all three dots are in resonance and , thus , the electrons may take with similar probability two different routes , namely @xmath100 .",
    "therefore one expects interference to be relevant , such that the current can be modified by a magnetic flux penetrating the ring .",
    "if the gate voltage is large , by contrast , i.e.  for @xmath101 , dot  2 is off - resonant and , thus , should be of minor relevance .",
    "therefore , the transport properties of the setup are expected to be essentially those of a double quantum dot formed by dots 1 and 3 .",
    "our numerical results , however , will demonstrate that this is only true for the average current , while the current noise is significantly altered by the presence of dot  2 even when far detuned .    as a first step , we solve the master equation numerically . in doing so",
    ", we identify parameter regimes in which the stationary state of the triple dot is dominated by a few eigenstates .",
    "this allows us to reduce the complexity of the master equation , such that we can achieve an analytical treatment that provides insight to the transport mechanism . for the numerical solution",
    ", we use the dot - lead coupling @xmath102 as energy unit . for the typical value @xmath103",

    "the stationary current as a function of the gate voltage @xmath105 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i_epsilon ] .",
    "it demonstrates that for @xmath106 , the current indeed is significantly flux dependent as conjectured above . for flux @xmath107 ,",
    "the current assumes its minimum .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for @xmath108 , the state @xmath109 is an eigenstate of the triple dot hamiltonian and is orthogonal to state @xmath110 .",
    "therefore it is not directly coupled to the right lead , which has the consequence that @xmath111 may trap an electron which henceforth blocks transport @xcite .",
    "this is formally related to an atomic state that is decoupled from a light field and , thus , remains invisible @xcite .",
    "current as a function of the gate voltage @xmath112 for different magnetic fluxes @xmath16 and bias voltages .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : i_epsilon ] demonstrates that for @xmath119 , interference plays a minor role .",
    "the reason for this is that when dot  2 is strongly detuned , transport through this off - resonant dot requires co - tunneling and , thus , the path via dot  2 has a significantly lower probability than the direct path .",
    "henceforth we focus on the region _ without _ interference effects .",
    "there a main feature of the current is that it exhibits plateaus , see fig .",
    "[ fig : current](a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the usual coulomb blockade scenario in which the bias and the gate voltage , determine the maximal number of electrons that can reside on the dots .",
    "accordingly , the probability for having a particular dot occupation changes at the steps , as can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig : current](b ) .",
    "moreover , an electron can tunnel from a left lead to the dots only if it has sufficient energy to compensate the coulomb repulsion of the electrons that are already in the triple quantum dot .",
    "thus the occupation with @xmath15 electrons ( @xmath120 ) is possible only if one chemical potential is larger than @xmath121 . for",
    "the symmetric positive voltage drop assumed herein , the larger chemical potential is @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that the occupation probability @xmath123 vanishes if @xmath124 , which is consistent with the occurrence of the steps shown in fig .",

    "so far we have seen that unless the bias voltage is extremely low , the current is always of the order @xmath129 , i.e.  changing the gate voltage or the bias voltage modifies the current typically by a factor of the order unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : fano ] demonstrates that the noise , characterized by the fano factor @xmath130 , generally exhibits a more significant dependence on both the bias and the gate voltage .    in the three - electron regime ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath131 , the fano factor is of order unity and almost independent of @xmath132 .",
    "this indicates that the transport process is poissonian . in the two - electron regime ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath133 , the fano factor [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fano](c ) ] exhibits a quadratic dependence on @xmath132 as well , but the absolute values are now significantly smaller .    a rather pronounced dependence on the gate voltage @xmath134 is found in that part of the single - electron regime in which the left chemical potential is so large that all single particle levels lie within the voltage window , i.e.  for @xmath135 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fano](b ) . in particular , we observe a quadratic growth of the fano factor , @xmath136 , with highly super - poissonian values .",

    "a more complete picture can be drawn by considering the distribution function of the transported electrons or equivalently all cumulants , i.e. , the full counting statistics . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the corresponding long - time limit which characterizes the low - frequency fluctuations . for avalanche - like transport ,",
    "higher - order cumulants were computed @xcite and recently also measured @xcite .    in a simplified picture",
    ", one may consider the electron avalanches as particles with charge @xmath141 that are transported in an uncorrelated manner .",
    "for this poisson process , the cumulants   grow exponentially fast with their index according to the relation @xcite @xmath142 closer theoretical investigations of avalanches with finite duration @xcite , however , indicate that this picture deserves some refinement .",
    "in fact there it was found that the cumulants grow even faster . in avalanche diodes , by contrast , the opposite was measured , namely that the cumulants do not grow as fast @xcite .",
    "but so far the underlying mechanism has not been revealed .",
    "figure [ fig : fcs ] depicts the super exponential growth of the @xmath143 in both the one - electron regime and the two - electron regime .",
    "the solid line demonstrates that only the cumulants of very low order follow the behavior of the poisson process underlying eq .  .",
    "thus , we also in our case observe that already the third cumulant slightly exceeds the value @xmath144 , while higher - order cumulants even assume significantly larger absolute values .",

    "if the bias voltage is so small that only one electron can reside on the triple dot , i.e.  for @xmath148 , all relevant eigenstates of @xmath149 are the empty state @xmath150 and the one - electron states .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath151 , the latter are given in the basis of the localized states @xmath152 by the expressions @xmath153 for symmetry reasons , each of these states couples with equal strength to the left and to the right lead , such that the corresponding incoherent transition rates from and to the leads are given by @xmath154 for the approximate eigenstates  the coupling constants read @xmath155 and @xmath156 .    if the dot - lead coupling @xmath102 is sufficiently small , one can neglect within a rotating - wave approximation off - diagonal elements of the reduced density operator @xcite , such that the system is well described by the occupation probabilities @xmath157 for the eigenstates @xmath150 and @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",

    "interestingly enough , the current does not depend on the structure of the eigenstates , which is a consequence of the mentioned sum rule for the @xmath168 .    for the liouville operator , not only the stationary current , but also the zero - frequency noise can be evaluated exactly . starting from the latter expression ,",
    "one obtains after some lines of straightforward calculation the result @xmath169 in the limit @xmath170 , only terms with @xmath171 in the denominator are relevant , so that we obtain @xmath172 . with the above expressions for @xmath168 , the corresponding fano factor becomes @xmath173 it indeed exhibits the predicted parabolic dependence on the gate voltage @xmath105 . a quantitative comparison of both the current and the fano factor with the numerical results depicted in fig .  [ fig : fano](b ) yields a satisfactory agreement in the range considered here .",
    "this implies that our one - electron model indeed captures the essential features of the electron avalanches through the triple quantum dot .",
    "moreover , it implies that the ( average ) size of the avalanches is @xmath174 .",
    "the proportionality of the fano factor to @xmath175 suggests for the transport in the one - electron regime the following scenario : assume that the off - resonant dot is initially unoccupied , while electrons are transported via dots  1 and 3 .",
    "then , according to standard perturbation theory , electrons in these dots may tunnel to dot  2 with a probability amplitude proportional to the tunnel matrix element divided by the energy difference , i.e.  with a probability @xmath176 .",
    "thus after on average @xmath177 electrons have been transported , an electron will tunnel to dot  2 and cause temporary coulomb blockade which is resolved only when the electron tunnels further .",
    "thus , the dynamics is given by periods with an open channel that on average terminate after an avalanche with @xmath178 electrons has been transported .",
    "this explains the observed proportionality of the fano factor @xmath179 .",
    "this scenario also hints on why the cumulants deviate from conjecture : the average duration of an avalanche is as long as the waiting time between subsequent avalanches , while conjecture is based on the assumption of a much shorter avalanche duration .    in the limit @xmath180 ,",
    "it is still possible to evaluate some cumulants of higher order analytically , although this becomes increasingly tedious .",
    "nevertheless it is worth proceeding up to forth order for which we obtain @xmath181 thus , the first two cumulants behave as expected for short avalanches with charge @xmath182 .",
    "however , already the third and the forth cumulant deviate from the poissonian value by a factor @xmath183 in compliance with our numerical observations in sec .",

    "the emergence of an interference pattern with good visibility usually requires the coherent superposition of two or more paths that are traversed with like probabilities . in an aharonov - bohm interferometer formed by quantum dots in ring configuration ,",
    "a significant detuning of the dot that is not connected to any lead has the consequence that transport through one arm requires co - tunneling .",
    "since this reduces the transmission probability of that path , the interference pattern as a function of a penetrating flux will fade away .",

    "thus , it can be decomposed into the series @xmath188 our goal is to find a series for the eigenvalue @xmath189 of @xmath190 that fulfills @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the eigenvalue of @xmath193 corresponding to a particular eigenvector @xmath194 , i.e. , @xmath195 .",
    "a central assumption is that both the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector @xmath196 can be decomposed into a series in @xmath186 as well , such that we can employ the ansatz @xmath197 for the present purpose , it is sufficient to consider only the case of non - degenerate @xmath192 . note that for non - hermitian @xmath193 , @xmath89 is generally not the hermitian adjoint of @xmath194 , but rather the corresponding left eigenvector , i.e. , the solution of @xmath198 .",
    "we choose the normalization such that @xmath199 .",
    "we start by writing the eigenvalue equation @xmath200 in the form @xmath201 which is convenient for the derivation of a formal solution and subsequent iteration . since @xmath202 , eq .",
    "defines @xmath196 only up to a component proportional to @xmath194 .",
    "moreover , it implies that the inverse of @xmath203 does not exist .",
    "it is however possible to define the pseudo - inverse @xmath204 [ or in short : @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the projector on the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath193 with non - zero eigenvalue . in the present case of",
    "non - degenerate @xmath192 , it reads @xmath207 .",
    "the pseudo - inverse allows one to cast eq .   into the form",
    "@xmath208 the first term on the right - hand side can be multiplied by any factor without violating eq .  .",
    "we have chosen it such that @xmath209 . moreover , since @xmath210 , the relation @xmath211 holds .",
    "an important feature of eq .",
    "is that the second term on the right - hand side is of first order in @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , it can be solved iteratively in the following way .",
    "multiplying eq .   by @xmath89 , we find that the left - hand - side vanishes owing to @xmath212 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath213 .",
    "we then insert for @xmath189 , @xmath185 , and @xmath196 the series  and compare coefficients to obtain the @xmath47th - order energy shift @xmath214 it depends on the still unknown correction of the eigenvector , @xmath215 , which we determine from eq .  .",
    "we again insert eqs .",
    " and compare coefficients to find @xmath216 equations and allow the recursive computation of the series for the eigenvalue shift @xmath189 ."
