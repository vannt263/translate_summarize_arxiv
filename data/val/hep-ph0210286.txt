    "the sm predicts the @xmath9 branching ratio to be @xcite    [ sm : bs ] ( ) = ( 3.21.5)10 ^ -9 , and the ratio of branching fractions [ rsm ] r_sm .",
    "|_sm ~o(10 ^ -2 ) , where @xmath10 is the lifetime of the @xmath11 meson , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the corresponding mass and decay constant .",
    "however , given the sm prediction of @xmath14 , the @xmath15 decay is experimentally remote unless it is significantly enhanced by new physics .",
    "thus , the purely leptonic decays of neutral @xmath16 mesons provide an ideal testing ground for physics outside the sm , with the current experimental upper bounds @xcite",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 , both given at @xmath19 .",
    "the main interest in this talk is in a qualitative comparison of the @xmath5 branching fractions in the presence of non - standard interactions , which can be made by using the ratio [ ratio : bdbs ] r. referring to , it is important to note that the suppression of @xmath6 in the sm is largely due to the ratio of the ckm elements .",
    "this dependence on the ckm factors allegedly pertains to all models in which the quark mixing matrix is the only source of flavour violation .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask if @xmath6 could be of the order unity in some non - standard models where flavour violation is governed exclusively by the ckm matrix .",
    "working in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a large ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath8 ( ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ) , we show that such a scenario does exist , and study its consequences for the @xmath5 branching ratios .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "first , in , we define modified minimal flavour violation ( @xmath4 ) and discuss briefly three distinct scenarios within the mssm .",
    "second , the effective hamiltonian describing the decays @xmath5 in the presence of non - sm interactions is given in .",
    "furthermore , in , numerical results for the branching fractions @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath6 are presented .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude .",
    "there exists no unique definition of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) in the literature ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "the common feature of these mfv definitions is that flavour violation and/or flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are entirely governed by the ckm matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "they differ , for example , by the following additional assumptions : i ) there are no new operators present , in addition to those of the sm , ii ) fcnc processes are proportional to the same combination of ckm elements as in the sm @xcite or iii ) flavour transitions occur only in charged currents at tree level . while these ad hoc assumptions are useful for certain considerations , such as the construction of the universal unitarity triangle @xcite , they can not be justified by symmetry arguments on the level of the lagrangian .",
    "for example , the number of operators with a certain dimension is always fixed by the symmetry of the low - energy effective theory .  whether the wilson coefficients are negligible or not , depends crucially on the model considered and on the part of the parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the requirement that fcnc processes are proportional to the same combination of ckm elements as in the sm fails , for example , in the mssm and can be retained only after further simplifying assumptions . the last statement in iii ) is of pure phenomenological relevance in order to avoid huge contributions to fcnc processes .",
    "using symmetry arguments , we propose an approach that relies only on the key ingredient of the mfv definitions in , without considering the above mentioned additional assumptions i)iii ) .",
    "we call an extension of the sm a modified minimal flavour - violating ( @xmath4 ) model if and only if fcnc processes or flavour violation are entirely ruled by the ckm matrix ; that is , we require that fcnc processes vanish to all orders in perturbation theory in the limit @xmath22 . for a motivation of this definition using symmetry arguments",
    "we refer the reader to .",
    "as will become clear , the advantage of @xmath4 is that it is less restrictive than mfv , while the ckm matrix remains the only source of fcnc transitions .",
    "our definition of @xmath4 is manifest basis independent .",
    "however , in order to find a useful classification of different @xmath4 scenarios within the mssm , we will work in the super - ckm basis .",
    "in this basis the quark mass matrices are diagonal , and both quarks and squarks are rotated simultaneously .",
    "the scalar quark mass - squared matrices in this basis have the structure [ squark : mass ] _",
    "u^2 = (    cc ^2_u_ll & ^2_u_lr + ^2_u_lr & ^2_u_rr    ) , _",
    "d^2 = (    cc ^2_d_ll & ^2_d_lr + ^2_d_lr & ^2_d_rr    ) , where the @xmath23 submatrices are given in @xcite . here",
    "we present the two important entries only : @xmath24 @xmath25 because of su(2 ) gauge invariance , the mass matrix @xmath26 is intimately connected to @xmath27 via [ su2 ] = ^ , which is important for our subsequent discussion .",
    "the above given definition of @xmath4 requires that the soft susy trilinear couplings @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the soft susy breaking squark masses @xmath30 , @xmath31 are diagonal .    taking into account the relation in ,",
    "one encounters three cases of @xmath4 .",
    "* scenario ( a ) : * + @xmath27 is proportional to the unit matrix , and so @xmath32 .  as a result , there are no gluino and neutralino contributions to flavour - changing transitions at one - loop level .",
    "this scenario of @xmath4 coincides with the mfv scenario at low @xmath8 as defined in refs . .",
    "* scenario ( b ) : * + @xmath33 is diagonal but not proportional to the unit matrix and , in consequence , @xmath27 has non - diagonal entries .",
    "in such a case , there are again no gluino and neutralino contributions to flavour - changing one - loop transitions involving only external down - type quarks and leptons .",
    "however , additional chargino contributions show up , due to non - diagonal entries of @xmath27 .",
    "* scenario ( c ) : * + @xmath27 is diagonal but not proportional to the unit matrix , which gives rise to off - diagonal entries in @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , gluino and neutralino exchange diagrams ( in addition to those involving @xmath34 , charged and neutral higgs bosons ) contribute to flavour - changing transitions at one - loop level that involve external down - type quarks .",
    "the common feature of all these scenarios is that the ckm matrix is the only source of flavour violation .",
    "the effective hamiltonian responsible for the processes @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in the presence of non - standard interactions is given by [ heff ] h_eff = - v_tb^v_tq^ * _ i=10,s , p[c_i()_i()+c_i()_i ( ) ] , with the short - distance coefficients @xmath38 and the local operators [ operator : basis ] _",
    "10=(|q ^ p_l b ) ( |l _ _ 5 l),_s= m_b ( |q p_r b ) ( |ll),_p= m_b ( |q p_r b)(|l _ 5 l ) , where @xmath39 . the primed operators can be obtained by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that the primed wilson coefficients are negligibly small , and hence can be safely neglected .    at high",
    "@xmath8 the scalar and pseudoscalar operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 become important in addition to the so called sm - operator @xmath44 . in this region of the parameter space an expansion according to @xmath8 is possible and a general expression for @xmath45 looks like c_i o_i = _",
    "n a_n ^n+1 ( ) ^n + _",
    "n b_n ^n ( ) ^n +  , where we call the first term leading and the second term subleading .",
    "@xmath46 denotes lepton and light quark masses while @xmath47 stands for masses of particles that have been integrated out .",
    "explicit expressions for the wilson - coefficients can be found in .",
    "the experimental bounds used in this numerical analysis as well as the ranges of the mssm parameters can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      recall that in scenario ( a ) the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath33 are equal and proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "therefore , the gluinos and neutralinos do not contribute at one - loop level .",
    "the scan over the parameter region shows that the ratio @xmath6 is approximately constant and close to @xmath48 .    in scenario ( b )",
    ", the matrix @xmath33 is diagonal , @xmath49 , with at least two different entries .",
    "hence , there are no gluino and neutralino contributions at one - loop level .",
    "employing the relation in , the matrix @xmath50 becomes non - diagonal .",
    "these off - diagonal flavour - changing entries are constrained by experimental data on @xmath51@xmath52 , @xmath53@xmath54 , @xmath55@xmath56 oscillations , and the @xmath57 decay @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the bounds on these flavour - changing entries@xcite severely constrain the additional chargino contributions in scenario ( b ) , hence we end up with a result similar to scenario ( a ) .",
    "@xmath6 varies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . neglecting the constraints we could have found @xmath6 in the range @xmath60 .      in this case",
    ", the matrix @xmath27 is diagonal , @xmath61 , with at least two different entries . according to the relation in ,",
    "this implies that @xmath33 has non - diagonal entries , so that gluinos and neutralinos contribute to the @xmath62 transition already at one - loop level . as before , we take the constraints of on these off - diagonal elements .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     an interesting subset of parameter points was considered in ( for details see ) interestingly , in the left ( right ) plot , the ratio @xmath6 ranges between @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , while the magnitude of the individual branching fractions decreases drastically with increasing charged higgs boson mass , @xmath65 . note that for small @xmath65 and @xmath8 close to @xmath21 both branching ratios are in a region that can be probed experimentally , in run ii of the fermilab tevatron , babar and belle .",
    "the neutralino wilson coefficients are numerically smaller than those coming from the chargino and gluino contributions .",
    "however , we have found that in certain regions of the mssm parameter space cancellations between the chargino and gluino coefficients occur , in which case the neutralino contributions become important . as a matter of fact , for the susy parameter sets examined",
    ", we found that a large value of @xmath1 always involves such a cancellation .",
    "we have defined @xmath4 using symmetry arguments and have shown that @xmath4 is less restrictive than mfv , while the ckm matrix remains the only source of flavour violation . within the mssm",
    "we have investigated three scenarios that are possible within the context of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we have studied the case where the chargino exchange diagrams @xcite as well as the gluino and neutralino exchange diagrams @xcite contribute besides @xmath66 [ scenario ( c ) ] .    including current experimental data on rare @xmath16 decays , as well as on @xmath67 meson mixing",
    ", we found that in certain regions of the susy parameter space the branching ratios @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be up to the order of @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "specifically , we showed that there exist regions in which the branching fractions of both decay modes are comparable in size , and may well be accessible to run ii of the fermilab tevatron as well as @xmath6 can deviate from @xmath72 by orders of magnitude .",
    "we wish to stress that a measurement of the branching ratios @xmath0 , or equivalently , a ratio @xmath6 of @xmath7 , does not necessarily imply the existence of new flavour violation outside the ckm matrix .",
    "nevertheless , any observation of these decay modes in ongoing and forthcoming experiments would be an unambiguous signal of new physics .",
