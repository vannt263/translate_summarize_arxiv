    "this has been supported by mir spectro - interferometric observations of ngc  1068 which find deeper silicate features with growing baseline @xcite .",
    "this is apparently inconsistent with homogeneously distributed dust @xcite .",
    "in addition , nir long - baseline interferometry of ngc  1068 finds a surprisingly high visibility at a baseline of 46 m which can not be explained by a simple homogeneous model @xcite . in figs .",
