    "in 1975 , stephen hawking ( one of the world s most famous physicists ) made a shocking claim that when quantum mechanics is allied with the general relativity , black holes ( bhs ) become to glow with hawking radiation ( hr ) @xcite .",
    "this emission consists of all sorts of massless / massive particles with different spins : spin@xmath0 .... hawking s prodigious calculations are based on a scenario that ubiquitous virtual particle pairs are continually being created near the event horizon of the bh due to the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "principally , these particles are created as a particle - antiparticle pair and immediately after they quickly annihilate each other . however , it is always possible that the one with negative energy ( in order to conserve the total energy ) falls into the bh while the other possessing the positive energy escapes to spatial energy as hr . today , hr is also called the bekenstein - hawking radiation in virtue of bekenstein s remarkable contributions @xcite to this phenomenon .    since 1975 ,",
    "the studies concerning hr have been carrying on . up to the present times ,",
    "many different methods for the hr are proposed ( the reader may refer to @xcite and references therein ) . among them , the most fascinating quantum tunneling methods are parikh and wilczek s null - geodesic method @xcite and the semiclassical methods of hamilton - jacobi @xcite and damour - ruffini @xcite . on the other hand , the hr of photons , scalar particles , massive vector bosons , and fermions from various bhs have been gained much attention in recent years ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the information loss paradox @xcite in the hr is one of the great puzzles for the physics community .",
    "some theorists bring forward an idea to retrieve the information from the bh encoded in the hr @xcite .",
    "however , this mystery have not been solved literally .    in the 1970s",
    ",  particle physicists realized that there are very close ties between two of the four fundamental forces @xcite  the weak force and the electromagnetic force which is single underlying force known as the electroweak force .",
    "the basic equations of the unified theory correctly describe the relationship between the electroweak force and its associated force - carrying particles [ photons and the massive vector bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) ] , except for a major glitch : all of these particles emerge without a mass ! although this is true for the photon , we know that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons must have mass , nearly hundred times that of a proton .",
    "the problem of spontaneously broken gauge theories in curved spacetime is well known in literature @xcite . so far , the higgs mechanism @xcite is the experimentally confirmed mechanism to solve the generation of mass problem in particle physics , which satisfies both the unitarity and the renormalization of the theory .    in this paper , we make a brief review for the derivation of the wave equation for the mass generating ( massive and charged ) scalar particles . applying the resulting equation obtained to the general 4-dimensional static and spherically symmetric metric , we obtain the general radial integral solution for the action of hamilton - jacobi method . as a test bed we consider the dyonic reissner - nordstrm bh ( drnbh ) @xcite and compute its quantum tunneling rate by using the latter radial integral solution of the action .",
    "finally , we show in detail how one recovers the original hr of the drnbh from the quantum tunneling of the mass generating particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the wave equation of a massive and charged mass generating scalar particle in a curved spacetime .",
    "section iii is devoted to the computations of the quantum tunneling of the mass generating scalar particles from the drnbh . while doing this , we are attentive to make our calculations with generic as much as possible .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section , we represent an expression for the wave equation of the mass generating particles .",
    "their associated scalar fields are non - minimally coupled to the gravity . the main idea underlying this mass generation mechanism",
    "is resplendently introduced in many textbooks ( see for instance @xcite ) .    for brevity , we initially use units @xmath3 .",
    "one may write down the action of the interaction of the scalar fields with gravity @xcite as follows @xmath4   , \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 stands for the scalar curvature and @xmath6 is the maxwell field strength with the spin-1 gauge field @xmath7 ( electromagnetic vector potential ) .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the dimensionless coupling constant which governs the non - minimal interaction of the scalar field @xmath9 @xcite with gravity . in other words ,",
    "the minimally coupled scalar fields correspond to @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that this coupling constant @xmath8 can also be used to stabilize the vacuum expectation value @xmath11 near the event horizon of a bh @xcite .",
    "the gauge - covariant derivative is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant ( i.e. the planck charge ) of the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath14 .",
    "the variation of the action ( 1 ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath15 leads to the einstein equations of motion as follows @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "its overlong expression can be seen in the study of moniz et al @xcite .",
    "significantly , when one applies the variation to the action ( 1 ) with respect to @xmath18 , the following wave equation is obtained @xmath19   + \\xi \\re\\phi+\\partial_{\\phi^{\\dag}}v=0 . \\label{4}\\ ] ]    the mass generating potential was also defined in @xcite as follows @xmath20    where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant and the coupling constant @xmath22 is dimensionless in 4-dimensional spacetime . without loss of generality , it is assumed that @xmath22 has a positive definite value .",
    "as clearly stated in @xcite , the vacuum expectation value must satisfy the condition of @xmath23 , which requires that @xmath24 must have a minimum at @xmath25 . to obtain the bounded solution for the hamiltonian",
    ", @xmath26 must be negative since @xmath22 is positive .",
    "due to this reason , we shift @xmath27 .",
    "hence , using eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we have @xmath28   \\phi . \\label{6}\\ ] ]    after assigning the reduced planck constant back to its original value @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be rewritten as @xmath30   + \\frac{1}{\\hslash^{2}}\\left [   \\xi\\re - m^{2}+2\\lambda(\\phi^{\\dag}\\phi)\\right ]   \\phi=0 . \\label{7}\\ ] ]    which is the wave equation of the mass generating particles with mass @xmath31 and charge @xmath13 in a curved spacetime .",
    "it is also important to know that whenever the scalar field @xmath9 is used for a nambu ",
    "goldstone boson in the gauge theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath8 is zero @xcite . on the other hand , if the scalar field @xmath9 represents a composite particle , then the value of @xmath8 is fixed by the dynamics of its components . in particular , @xmath32 in the large @xmath33 approximation to the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the standard model , the higgs fields possess the values of @xmath8 within the range of @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the line - element for the 4-dimensional generic static ( spherically symmetric ) bh metric is given by@xmath36 where the metric functions @xmath37 are only the function of @xmath38 .",
    "any horizon @xmath39 should satisfy the condition of @xmath40 and @xmath39 is , in general , a function of the mass and charge of the bh .",
    "the hawking temperature of a bh described by the metric ( 8) is given by @xcite @xmath41    where @xmath42 and the prime over a quantity denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the ricci scalar @xcite for the metric ( 8) can be found as @xmath43    in order to study the quantum tunneling of the mass generating particles from the generic bh ( 8) , we use the wkb approximation and assume an ansatz for the scalar field @xmath9 as follows @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the amplitude of the wave and @xmath46 stands for the classically forbidden action of the trajectory .",
    "metric ( 8) admits two killing vectors @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , which show the existence of the symmetries .",
    "therefore , one can assume a solution for the action as @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes energy , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are radial and angular functions , respectively .",
    "( 12 ) @xmath55  is a complex constant .",
    "since @xmath7 represents the electromagnetic vector potential , for a dyonic bh with electric and magnetic components one should have @xmath56   $ ] . under the guidance of the hamilton - jacobi method @xcite , we first insert eqs .",
    "[ 11 - 13 ] in eq .",
    "( 7 ) and then consider the terms with the leading order of @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following lenghty expression @xmath58   r^{2}-2\\left [   \\left (   g^{\\prime}r^{\\prime } -2 + 2gr^{\\prime\\prime}\\right )   f+gf^{\\prime}r^{\\prime}\\right ]   fr+r^{\\prime } f^{2}g\\}\\xi\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath59   \\mathrm{\\sin}^{\\mathrm{2}}\\theta-(ea_{1}-{j_{\\varphi}})^{2})f+r\\mathrm{\\sin}^{\\mathrm{2}}\\theta e_{net}^{2}\\right\\ }   = 0 , \\label{13}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we derive an integral solution for @xmath53 as follows @xmath63   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}dr , \\label{14}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    since @xmath67 , the near horizon form of eq .",
    "( 14 ) becomes @xmath68    which is essential expression for computing the quantum tunneling rate .",
    "now , we test the above result obtained via the drnbh geometry @xcite whose the metric functions and electromagnetic vector potential components are given by @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    where the physical quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the drnbh s characteristic parameters : @xmath72 is the electric charge and @xmath73 is the magnetic charge .",
    "the outer or event ( @xmath74 ) and inner ( @xmath75 ) horizons of the drnbh are given by @xmath76    where @xmath77 .",
    "( 22 ) the parameter @xmath78 represents the mass of the drnbh .",
    "since @xmath79 consequently @xmath80 around the event horizon . here , one can immediately criticize why the @xmath81 parameter including the particle s mass @xmath31  quickly drops out of the considerations .",
    "however , one can experience from the previous studies @xcite that the non - differential terms coupled to the wave function @xmath9  ( for example , in eq . ( 7 ) , it corresponds to @xmath82   \\phi$ ] ) apart from the operator term acting on @xmath9 ( like the laplacian operator : @xmath83 ) always looses its effiency near the horizon .",
    "that is why , for instance , the hr is independent from the particle s mass @xcite .",
    "thus , eq . ( 18 ) reduces to @xmath84    meanwhile , we now have @xmath85 .",
    "it is obvious that the above integrand possesses a simple pole at the event horizon . to evaluate integral ( 23 )",
    ", we first expand the metric function @xmath86 as follows @xmath87    substituting the above expression into eq .",
    "( 23 ) and choosing the contour as a half loop going around this pole from left to right , one obtains @xmath88    thus , the imaginary part of the action ( 12 ) becomes @xmath89    thence , we compute the probabilities of ingoing and outgoing particles tunneling the drnbh horizon as @xmath90 @xmath91    classically , having a bh is conditional on the no - reflection for the ingoing waves , which meants full absorption : @xmath92 .",
    "this is possible simply by setting @xmath93 ( for similar and recent works , the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein ) which results in @xmath94    consequently , we read the quantum tunneling rate for the drnbh as @xmath95    employing the boltzmann formula @xmath96 @xcite , the surface temperature of the drnbh can be computed as @xmath97    which is exactly equal to the standard hawking temperature of the drnbh @xcite .",
    "temperature versus mass plotting is depicted in fig .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath98 . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "( 1 ) , the locations of the peaks on the @xmath78-axis ( which are very close to their associated starting mass value @xmath99 : the extreme bh case , @xmath100 ) shift towards right with increasing @xmath78-value , however the peak values decrease when @xmath101 gets bigger numbers .",
    "moreover , while @xmath102 all the curves of the temperatures rapidly reach to the curve of the schwarzschild ( @xmath103 ) bh s hawking temperature , which goes to zero with increasing @xmath78-value .     versus drnbh mass @xmath78 .",
    "the plots are governed by eq .",
    "the starting masses are governed by @xmath99 . ]",
    "in this paper , we firstly reviewed the derivation of the wave equation for the mass generating scalar particles in the concept of the spontaneous symmetry breaking theory . to this end",
    ", we introduced an action involving a non - minimal scalar field coupled to the gravity . by using the hamilton - jacobi method with a suitable wkb ansatz",
    ", the quantum tunneling of the mass generating bosons from a generic static bh is thoroughly studied .",
    "we then obtained the general integral solution for the radial function ( 14 ) for the hamilton - jacobi action @xmath46 .",
    "drnbh geometry whose the metric functions satisfy the equality @xmath104 is considered as a test background for our computations .",
    "it is seen that scalar particle mass @xmath31 , the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath8 , and the potential constant @xmath22 are not decisive for the quantum tunneling rate , however the charge @xmath13 is . in the semiclassical framework , we computed the probabilities of the ingoing and outgoing particles to get the quantum tunneling rate for the drnbh .",
    "finally , we managed to read the standard hawking temperature of the drnbh via the boltzmann formula of the tunneling rate .    in future work",
    ", we plan to extend our analysis to a bh ( might be a spherically non - symmetric ) having @xmath86 , which does not vanish at the event horizon : @xmath105 . because in such a case eq .",
    "( 18 ) may yield such @xmath106 values ( having now the potential constant term @xmath22 ) that the quantum tunneling rate can deviate from its pure thermal character @xcite and give contribution to the information loss problem @xcite .",
    "we also aim to extend our analysis to the dynamic , rotating and higher / lower dimensional bhs . in this way",
    ", we will analyze the hr of the mass generating particles from various bhs .",
