    "the electron - phonon ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) interaction plays an important role in many systems including conventional metals and superconductors , @xcite organic semiconductors,@xcite fullerenes,@xcite and a large number of transition metal oxides.@xcite in general , the @xmath0-@xmath1  interaction induces a local distortion of the lattice surrounding a carrier , resulting in quasiparticles dressed by phonon excitations known as polarons . in some cases these lattice distortions",
    "can be large and tightly bound to the electron , such that the quasiparticle has a very large effective mass @xmath2 and vanishing quasiparticle residue @xmath3.@xcite in this limit , the quasiparticle is typically referred to as a small polaron . in most models ,",
    "the crossover to the small polaron regime occurs for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 parameterizes the ( dimensionless ) strength of the @xmath0-@xmath1  interaction .",
    "when @xmath6 the carriers are still dressed by the lattice , forming large polarons where the lattice distortions are spread out over many lattice constants .",
    "almost all of our knowledge about the effects of the @xmath0-@xmath1  interaction has been obtained from linear models .",
    "the derivation of these models is standard .",
    "first , the @xmath0-@xmath1  interaction is expanded in powers of the atomic displacement .",
    "this is followed by a truncation of the expansion to linear order under the _ assumption _ of small lattice displacements .",
    "these same models , however , often predict the formation of small polarons or charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phases for sufficiently large @xmath0-@xmath1  coupling , which are characterized by large lattice displacements .",
    "for example , the displacements in the linear holstein and hubbard - holstein models can be on the order of the lattice constant when cdw correlations are significant.@xcite this can occur even for weak values of the @xmath0-@xmath1  coupling if the fermi surface is well nested , as is the case for the holstein model with nearest neighbor hopping on a cubic lattice .",
    "similarly , a small polaron can be dressed by tens to hundreds of phonon quanta,@xcite implying the presence of a heavily distorted lattice surrounding the carrier .",
    "clearly , these predictions directly violate the assumptions underlying the linear model , which is an unambiguous sign that important physics has been discarded during its derivation.@xcite    these considerations show that the higher order terms in the @xmath0-@xmath1   interaction are likely to be important whenever the linear term is large ( or when strong nesting conditions are present ) . but non - linear and anharmonic effects",

    "switched on \" in a weakly coupled system , if the underlying atoms of the lattice are driven far from their equilibrium positions by an external perturbation .",
    "for example , several recent experiments have exploited optical pump pulses to drive the lattice , creating large lattice deformations or exciting coherent phonon oscillations.@xcite these excited lattice states can melt various ordered phases@xcite or can induce transient superconducting states.@xcite here , nonlinear and anharmonic phonon dynamics are thought to play a vital role in creating such transient states.@xcite    the first attempts to include higher order terms were made by adolphs and berciu ( ref . ) .",
    "they considered the effects of non - linear @xmath0-@xmath1  interactions on a single polaron in the holstein model using the momentum average approximation@xcite and found that small non - linear couplings dramatically undress the quasiparticle .",
    "this was attributed to a simultaneous hardening of the bare phonon frequency and a renormalization of the bare @xmath0-@xmath1  coupling constant , resulting in an overall weaker effective linear interaction .",
    "later work by some of the present authors considered finite carrier concentrations and temperatures using non - perturbative determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc).@xcite here too , the presence of a non - linear interaction was found to suppress the tendency towards the formation of cdw and superconducting states found in the linear model .",

    "since dqmc is formulated in the grand canonical ensemble , we are able to examine these properties at finite temperatures and carrier concentrations for the first time .",
    "we find that the inclusion of a non - linear interaction renormalizes both the effective frequency of the holstein phonon and the effective @xmath0-@xmath1  coupling strength , resulting in significant changes in both the electronic and phononic properties of the model .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that while the qualitative effects of the non - linearity can be framed in terms of an effective linear model , the quantitative effects on both the electronic and phononic properties of the model can not be .",
    "this conclusion requires an examination of both the electronic and phononic properties , and thus can not be arrived at by considering electronic properties only .",

    "the non - linear holstein model is characterized by several dimensionless parameters , and the specific choice in parameterization is not unique . here ,",

    "these results show that while the _ qualitative effects _ can be understood using an effective linear model , the full non - linear interaction should be retained if one wishes to accurately capture the effects of the non - linear interaction on both the phononic and electronic properties of the system .",

    "[ fig : z_neg]b",
    ". both of these observations are in line with the expected increase in the effective linear coupling .",

    "in addition , we also see a noticeable decrease in the pair - field susceptibility at band fillings where the cdw does not dominate .",

    "we find that the inclusion of a positive non - linear interaction term serves to undress the polaron leading to carriers with lighter effective masses .",
    "this leads to changes in the energetics of both the electrons and phonons , as well as the relaxation of the local lattice distortions surrounding each carrier .",
    "this is due to a simultaneous hardening of the phonon frequency and renormalization of the effective linear coupling to smaller values .",
    "we have also examined the case when the quadratic @xmath0-@xmath1  interaction has the opposite sign as the linear interaction , although this case can not be explored in detail without the inclusion of additional anharmonic terms in the lattice potential .",

    "while many of the effects we have discussed can be understood qualitatively at the mean - field level , we have demonstrated that the quantitative effects can only be captured by the full non - linear model .",
