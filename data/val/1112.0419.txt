    "the phase diagrams of iron - based superconductors demonstrate that , as for the cuprates , the superconducting state generally emerges from a magnetic parent compound under chemical substitution @xcite . however , in contrast to the cuprates where the magnetic state is due to electrons localized in a mott insulator , in iron - based superconductors it arises from an instability of the delocalised fe d - band electrons @xcite .",

    "we also observe a peak in @xmath66 at around 17k ( most noticeable in the sample with @xmath65 but weakened and broadened for higher @xmath18 ) which may be due to increased correlation between the static moments ( but which stops short of lro , as we do not observe a precession signal in zf-@xmath3sr ) .",

    "[ alltf](a ) ] , lending further weight to this interpretation .",
    "we can extract an estimate of the magnetic contribution to @xmath66 in the i m regime by assuming that a magnetic contribution and a non - magnetic contribution ( the latter assumed to be that of the @xmath67 sample ) add in quadrature .",
    "this rms field width can then be used to provide an estimate of the precession frequency [ @xmath69 that would have been observed if the moments in the i m state ordered , and we plot these as open circles in fig .  [ as2](a ) . by assuming the same scaling between frequency and @xmath31 as for the af - ordered region",
    ", we can use these values to estimate @xmath31 which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ as2](b ) using open circles .",
    "these data show that as @xmath18 increases , the moment on the fe site undergoes a process of steady suppression , initially resulting in a loss of af order as the order loses long - range coherence but then collapsing further in the i m state .",

    "[ phaseplot ] ) .",
    "the black line in ( d ) is a fit to a conventional sc order parameter temperature dependence .",
    "[ alltf ] ]",
    "it has recently been suggested that the structural transition in the iron pnictides is driven by magnetic fluctuations @xcite , rather than by magnetic order .",
    "the fluctuations could be of different types : spin - nematic fluctuations @xcite , ferro - orbital fluctuations or critical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our discussion will focus on the spin - nematic model of ref .   which we believe explains the main features of our data .",
    "the theoretical picture is motivated by the magnetic structure found in these materials , where fe spins are coupled antiferromagnetically for fe - fe bonds along one diagonal of the two - fe tetragonal unit cell and ferromagnetically along the other diagonal .",
    "this results in two coupled antiferromagnetic sublattices with coplanar staggered magnetization .",
    "the sublattice coupling is related to a @xmath72 symmetry , which allows two possible orientations of stripes in the magnetic structure .",
    "this symmetry is broken by _ nematic order _ , which can be present with zero sublattice magnetization and whose onset may therefore occur at temperatures above any magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "the result of this nematic order is to bias the magnetic fluctuations along a particular stripe orientation .",
    "crucially , the nematic order parameter couples to the lattice , causing bonds between neighboring ( anti)parallel spins to ( expand ) contract and this leads to the observed structural distortion .",
    "the prerequisite for nematic order is a large , but finite , magnetic correlation length , whose occurrence at elevated temperatures is probable for materials in both the magnetically ordered and i m region of the phase diagram of nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as .    from this point of view",
    "it is magnetic fluctuations , biased by nematic order , that not only lead to magnetic order , but also drive the structural distortion .",
    "substituting fe by co causes a reduction in the strength of these magnetic fluctuations and this suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion .",
    "our measurements show that on increasing @xmath18 the structural and magnetic order parameters weaken until the fluctuations can no longer sustain magnetic order above @xmath73 .",
    "further substitution of fe by co continues to weaken the fluctuations and this coincides with the weakening of the structural distortion order parameter until fluctuations can no longer sustain the structural order parameter for @xmath74 .",
    "this weakening of the magnetic fluctuations is coincident with a strengthening of superconductivity in nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as .",
    "this is also consistent with the nematic order picture , which predicts a competition between superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "specifically , the onset of superconductivity is predicted to lead to a reduction in the static part of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite which weakens the magnetic order and spin correlations .",
    "this is seen in our data , where we observe the low @xmath61 suppression of ( i ) the magnetic order parameter in the @xmath75 material ( where long - range magnetic order is only just sustained ) and ( ii ) the structural order parameter for @xmath76 ( where the structural order parameter has been weakened ) .",
    "we note that these samples have close to full superconducting volume fraction and the dip in the order parameter is only observed for @xmath77 , where the superconducting order parameter has become sufficiently strong .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with those obtained on another  111 \" superconductor , lifeas @xcite .",
    "a result of accommodating the smaller li@xmath78 ion ( rather than na@xmath79 ) between the feas layers is that the edge - staring feas@xmath80 tetrahedra in lifeas are very compressed in the basal plane .",
    "superconductivity occurs in the stoichiometric material lifeas , in contrast to other iron arsenide superconductors for which doping away from the formal oxidation state of fe@xmath81 or the application of hydrostatic pressure is required to induce superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , stoichiometric lifeas does not appear to show static magnetism @xcite ( in contrast to nafeas ) .",
    "the present study demonstrates that substituing a small amount of co on the fe site strengthens the superconducting state in nafeas , but in lifeas substitution of fe by small amounts of co or ni results in a steady lowering of the superconducting transition temperature @xcite . for lifeas ,",
    "@xmath4 is lowered monotonically at a rate of 10k per 0.1 electrons added per formula unit irrespective of whether the dopant is co and ni , and at higher substitution levels superconductivity is completely suppressed .",
    "( co and ni have a similar _ structural _ effect as a function of the level of doping , but ni adds twice as many electrons as co. ) the number of electrons added per formula unit is also the determinative quantity for nafeas , but here the superconducting state is first strengthened ( as the magnetic state is destroyed ) and then weakened ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "finally , the behavior of the superfluid stiffness as a function of @xmath4 in lifeas derivatives is markedly different from that of other pnictides @xcite , including the isostructural nafeas - derivatives considered here and the  1111 \" and  122 \" classes @xcite .",
    "most of the pnictides exhibit behavior more similar to the hole - doped cuprates , but lifeas derivatives resemble much more closely the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "the differing behavior of lifeas may result from the underlying structural difference introduced by the small li@xmath79 ion , resulting in a band structure which does not favor fermi surface nesting @xcite so that the magnetic instability found in the other isoelectronic ( i.e. undoped ) iron arsenides does not compete successfully against superconductivity in lifeas .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a picture of nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as in which a magnetic interaction drives both magnetic lro and a structural distortion and weakens with the subsitution of fe by co , causing a decrease in the size of the ordered magnetic moment .",
    "magnetic lro becomes unsustainable above @xmath82 but the structural distortion persists until the moment in the i m state is no longer strong enough sustain it .",
    "the i m state may be characterized by a long , but finite magnetic correlation length and nematic order , which biases the magnetic fluctuations along stripes .",
    "competing directly with magnetism is superconductivity which , on reaching full volume fraction , weakens the magnetism dramatically and is seen directly to depress the magnetic and structural order parameters at low temperature .",
