    "in contrast , there are very few investigations of the data with respect to topics where velocities and accelerations play a significant role such as testing or calibrating car - following models @xcite or lane - changing models , or estimating fuel consumption @xcite . since velocities and accelerations are derived quantities , the noise in the ngsim positional information is greatly increased and a direct application is not possible .    in this work",
    ", we will first propose and motivate a smoothing method that enables the ngsim data to be used for data analysis using the velocity or acceleration information .",
    "the smoothed velocities will then be used to calculate the density function of the two - dimensional distribution of velocity and inverse distance , and the density of the distribution corresponding to a `` microscopic '' fundamental diagram .",

    "the trajectory data available for download seems to be unfiltered and exhibits some noise artefacts .",
    "all data sets include velocity and acceleration . however , they seem to have been numerically derived from the tracked vehicle positions without any processing . fig .  [",
    "fig : originaldata ] visualizes the problems of the data : in the prototype dataset two thirds of all accelerations are beyond @xmath5{m / s^2}$ ] ( which are then reported as @xmath6{m / s^2}$ ] in the datafile ) , as can be seen from the acceleration distribution .",
    "the example trajectory shows that the driver is allegedly changing between hard acceleration and hard deceleration several times a second which is clearly unrealistic . in the later i-80 and us-101 datasets , the acceleration distributions are more realistic  though approximately 10% are beyond @xmath5{m / s^2}$ ] .",
    "however , in the later datasets , the velocity distributions are very spiky , i.e. , velocities tend to snap to certain values .",
    "looking at the velocities of an example trajectory exhibits an unrealistic behavior : if taken for real , this would mean that drivers do not smoothly brake or accelerate but use the gas and brake pedal only occasionally but hard to quickly change between `` preferred velocities '' .",
    "also , to produce the spikes in the velocity distribution , all drivers must happen to `` like '' the same velocities .",
    "this is clearly unrealistic and therefore the velocity spikes must be an artefact of the measurement method .",
    "one may credit the velocity spikes to discretization errors ( time and space are discretized , thus velocity can only take certain discrete values as well ) , but two observations object to that : first , the spikes are not delta peaks , other velocities still do appear .",
    "second , given the time discretization @xmath7{s}$ ] and the approximate distance between the velocity spikes @xmath8{m / s}$ ] , this would mean that the spatial accuracy of the measurement method is just @xmath9{m}$ ] ( which is obviously not the case ) .",

    "this process is presented in this section .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the measured position of vehicle @xmath11 at time @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the number of datapoints of the trajectory .",
    "the smoothing kernel is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the smoothing width .",
    "since the datapoints are equidistant in time with interval @xmath17 , we can formulate the smoothing operation by using datapoint indices instead of times .",
    "the smoothed positions @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 the smoothing width @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 and transparently handles the different time intervals in the datasets ( the prototype dataset uses @xmath22{s}$ ] while the later two use @xmath7{s}$ ] ) : we can use the same real time smoothing width @xmath16 for all datasets and @xmath23 will be the corresponding smoothing width measured in datapoints for the specific dataset . the smoothing window width @xmath24 is chosen to be three times the smoothing kernel width for any data point that is not closer than @xmath25 data points to either trajectory boundary .",
    "for the points near the boundaries , the smoothing width is decreased to ensure that the smoothing window is always symmetric .",
    "it may be objected that other filters would work as well or even better , e.g. , the kalman filter or a simple moving average . a moving average filter , which would correspond to eq .   with the exponentials removed , has non - continuous filter boundaries , i.e. , with moving the filter data points suddenly slip into the smoothing window with full weight or suddenly drop out .",
    "this can cause smoothing artefacts which are prevented by using a weighted moving average where the weight decreases with increasing distance from the smoothing window center . this way data points",
    "will be smoothly incorporated into the smoothing window and fall out smoothly as well .",
    "we found that an exponential weight function leads to better results than a gaussian filter , thus we decided for the sema .",
    "the kalman filter needs a simple traffic model and thus introduces some significant assumptions into the smoothing process .",
    "also , the kalman filter has more parameters while the sema method has only one parameter , @xmath16 , and does not introduce complicated assumptions .    another possible filter would be to not use some moving kernel filter but increase the step size from @xmath17 to @xmath26 in calculation of the velocities and accelerations , i.e. , @xmath27 . it can be shown that this filter is equal to a simple moving average for the velocities and a composition of two moving averages for the accelerations ( which simplifies to a triangular moving average when boundary regions are neglected ) .",
    "this filter is a faster but somewhat worse alternative to our proposed method .",
    "having defined the fundamental smoothing mechanism , there are still two open questions : first , the order of differentiations and smoothing operations need to be defined , and second , a smoothing width @xmath16 must be found .    addressing the first question ,",
    "there are three possible answers : ( i ) smooth positions , then differentiate to velocities and accelerations , ( ii ) first differentiate to velocities and accelerations and then smooth all three variables , or ( iii ) smooth positions , differentiate to velocities , smooth velocities , differentiate to accelerations and smooth accelerations . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the smoothing   commutes with the differentiation , and all these methods are equivalent . in view of the short trajectories , however , the points closer to the boundary can not be neglected .",
    "the first method is very problematic as can be seen by the following reasoning .",
    "consider an artificial trajectory with constant acceleration : @xmath29 .",
    "any symmetric smoothing kernel will overestimate the position and produce a trajectory @xmath30 . sufficiently far away from the boundaries ,",
    "the smoothing window width @xmath25 is constant and the smoothed trajectory @xmath31 has a constant error proportional to the variance @xmath32 of the smoothing kernel . near the boundaries , however , @xmath25 and @xmath33 will become smaller and vanish for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which results in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the offset of the smoothed positions becomes smaller when approaching the boundaries , which of course induces a bias to the velocity .",
    "moreover , if the smoothing kernel does not completely vanish at the smoothing window borders , the transition between constant offset and decreasing offset will not be continuously differentiable inducing a jump in velocity and thus an even larger jump in the acceleration .",
    "therefore , we discourage from this smoothing method .    in order to decide for the second or third smoothing method , we have generated artificial benchmark trajectories and added some white noise to the positions . the second method ",
    "first the differentiation to velocities and accelerations and then the smoothing of the three variables  turned out to better reproduce the original trajectories , thus we decided to use this method .",
    "this left us with the difficult question of which smoothing width @xmath16 to use .",
    "there is no generic recipe , but we collected some hints that helped making this decision not completely arbitrary .",
    "first , we extracted the most `` vivid '' trajectories  those with a large velocity range  from each dataset and compared the variance of the accelerations , @xmath38 , for different smoothing widths ( cf .",
    "[ fig : smoothing](a ) ) . for @xmath39 , the acceleration variance of the smoothed trajectory would vanish , but the variance that is caused by the noise vanishes much faster than the one caused by the real acceleration data",
    "thus , with finite @xmath16 the noise is smoothed out very quickly , leading to a fast drop in @xmath40 at small @xmath16 . for larger",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath40 appears to be nearly constant . keeping in mind that the real acceleration data is smoothed a little bit as well",
    ", the plot suggests a smoothing width of about @xmath41{s}$ ] .    however , this value is a suggestion for the _ acceleration _ smoothing width only",
    ". we will now show that it is not necessary to use such large smoothing widths for the positions and velocities .",
    "let @xmath42 be a random variable describing the positions of vehicle @xmath11 with expectation value @xmath43 and variance @xmath44 .",
    "the measured trajectory @xmath10 is a realization of @xmath42 and , assuming unbiased noise , the real trajectory is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "now , we define two new random variables describing the velocities and accelerations of vehicle @xmath11 in terms of symmetric difference quotients , @xmath45 since this is a linear combination of random variables , the expectation values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 will be the first and second derivative of @xmath43 , respectively ( the real velocities and the real accelerations ) .",
    "assuming uncorrelated noise , the variances of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 thus , the noise will be strongly amplified by the differentiation and therefore , the velocities must be weaker smoothed than the acceleration and the positions weaker than the velocities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : smoothing](b , c ) we plotted the lateral positions and longitudinal velocities and accelerations of a sample trajectory of the us-101 dataset as original data and for different smoothing widths .",
    "the position smoothing width @xmath49 is very critical , because the lane change duration is quite sensitive to it .",
    "as visible in the plot , a large @xmath49 will significantly smear out the trajectory leading to larger lane change durations . in order to resolve the issue with the `` preferred velocities ''",
    "the smoothing of the velocities should be strong enough so that the smoothed velocities no longer follow the trends of this `` semi - quantization '' .",
    "however , the smoothing should be as weak as possible because the velocity smoothing width also quantitatively influences some results .",
    "finally , we decided in favor of the smoothing times @xmath50{s}\\text { , } \\ ,    t_v = \\unit[1]{s}\\text{,}\\,\\text { and } \\ ,    t_a = \\unit[4]{s}.\\ ] ] the effects of this smoothing on the acceleration distribution of the prototype dataset and the velocity distribution of the two later datasets can be seen in fig .",

    "most empirical traffic state data is gathered by stationary loop detectors that can measure quantities at different times , but at a single location only .",
    "these measurement devices are therefore capable of measuring temporal quantities , but not spatial quantities . however , since both spatial and temporal quantities are important in traffic science , it is common practice to derive the spatial quantities from temporal measurements by using some conservation assumptions ( e.g. , constant vehicle velocities within a certain time period ) .",
    "modern trajectory data like the ngsim recordings provide enough data to enable a validation of these practices .    in the following , we will describe the analysis process to obtain spatial information from temporal data , and vice versa , and check its accuracy for three examples : the microscopic fundamental diagram , and the distributions of the time gaps and times - to - collision .",
    "later , we will investigate lane changes in the ngsim data .",
    "all following analysis will use the smoothed datasets obtained by the smoothing method introduced and motivated above  and all references to any `` ngsim dataset '' are to be understood as references to the smoothed datasets .",
    "the two measurement types we want to compare are the traditional stationary loop detector , which is singular in space but continuous in time , and an aerial photograph , which is continuous in space but singular in time .",
    "the basic idea of our analysis is to place virtual loop detectors into the trajectory data .",
    "these would correspond to lines parallel to the time axis in a space - time - plot , while lines parallel to the space axis correspond to momentary snapshots ( virtual photographs ) of the measurement area ( cf .",
    "[ fig : virtualdetectors ] ) . wherever those lines intersect , both stationary and momentary measurements are available for comparison . to maximize the amount of data available for comparison ,",
    "we applied the following algorithm to the data : for every tenth datapoint of each trajectory , the spatial leader and the temporal leader are determined .",
    "the spatial leader @xmath51 is the vehicle currently driving ahead of the vehicle @xmath11 and the temporal leader is the vehicle that most recently passed the actual position of vehicle @xmath11 ( for simplicity , we will denote the temporal leader with @xmath51 as well ) .",
    "the first information is only available to momentary measurements while the second is only available to stationary measurements .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      besides the ability to compare stationary and momentary measurements , the ngsim trajectory data sets also provide a good basis to investigate lane changes . in order to determine the lane change duration",
    ", we collected all lane changes in the ngsim data .",
    "however , from the processed video data supplied with the ngsim datasets it can be seen that sometimes the tracking algorithm accidentally misplaced a vehicle across the lane boundary and back after a few timesteps . also , sometimes drivers might have abort an already begun lane change or quickly crossed two lanes . since we just want to look at real and normal single - lane lane changes , we therefore filtered out all lane changes that were closer than a certain threshold @xmath52 to another lane change , which we chose to be @xmath53{s}$ ] .",
    "we also sorted out lane changes that did not involve one of the four left - most lanes in order to reduce the effect of the on-/off - ramp on our lane change analysis .",
    "the former criterion was chosen to sort out cases where drivers aborted an already begun lane change or where the tracking algorithm accidently misplaced a vehicle across the lane boundary .",
    "the latter criterion ensures that we look at discretionary lane changes only .    with @xmath54 denoting the lane used by vehicle @xmath11 at time @xmath55 , a lane - changing event occurs at time @xmath56 if @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the time interval between two consecutive datapoints of a trajectory ) . for each lane - changing event , we extracted a 20-second - environment of the trajectory with time , longitudinal and lateral position relative to the lane - changing event : @xmath59 then , we are able to produce a plot of the conditional probability density @xmath60 that a vehicle is at a relative lateral position @xmath61 at a certain time @xmath62 relative to the lane - changing event time ( fig .  [ fig : lanechanges ] , top ) . from this , we can roughly estimate the lane change duration to approximately @xmath63{s}$ ] by looking at the curvature of the two mode values @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this procedure is similar to the approach done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the lane change start and end time of each trajectory were determined by looking at the curvature of the lateral position @xmath66 . however , finding the correct point in the curvature might be somewhat arbitrary , thus we will in the following look at a more well - defined way to measure a lower bound of the lane change duration .",
    "the ngsim vehicle detection algorithm does not only detect the vehicle position but also its length @xmath67 and width @xmath68 .",
    "since the lane assignment algorithm works such that each datapoint is placed into the lane where its mid - point front - bumper position @xmath69 lies in , it is possible to determine the time where a lane - changing vehicle first intruded the destination lane and the time where it just completely left the source lane . given the lane - changing event time @xmath56 and the relative time and position as defined in eqs .",
    " , the relative start time @xmath70 and end time @xmath71 of the lane change may be defined as follows ( a higher lane index @xmath72 corresponds to a larger lateral position @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 then , of course , the lane change duration is obtained trivially from @xmath75    in total , we have investigated 1231 lane changes , 1105 of which were suitable to calculate @xmath76 according to eq .  .",
    "in the remaining 126 cases , either @xmath70 or @xmath71 were undefined because the corresponding condition was not fulfilled for any @xmath77 $ ] within the 20-second - environment around the lane change .",
    "this can be attributed to vehicle dimension detection errors or vehicle tracking errors , both leading to a trajectory where the vehicle drives on the lane boundary for some time . figure  [ fig : lanechanges ] ( bottom left ) shows the distribution of the lane change duration of the examined lane changes .",
    "one immediately notices that most lane changes take somewhat about @xmath78{s}$ ] ( mode value of the distribution ) , a value already found valid for german highways back in 1978  @xcite , which is , however , substantially different from the one obtained by rule of thumb from the conditional probability density @xmath60 .",
    "the mean and standard variation of the distribution are @xmath79{s}.    \\label{eq : ngsim_tlc}\\ ] ] however , one should be aware that definition   measures the time span where the vehicle occupies two lanes , which can only be taken as a lower bound of the real lane change duration . including the preparation and possible post - processing of a lane change , a value of @xmath63{s}$ ] might seem realistic . since the `` real '' beginning of a lane change , the decision for making the lane change , is impossible to measure , and the ",
    "physical beginning , the moment where the driver starts to turn the wheel , is very difficult if not impossible to measure , we think that our proposed definition is a good estimator for the lane change duration , because it uses well - defined and easily measurable quantities .    in the lower right , fig .",

    "the availability of the ngsim data sets spurred a considerable research activity , particularly with respect to lane changing , where larger - scale empirical investigations are now possible for the first time .",
    "to date , most researchers only used the positional information which allows , for example , to investigate the lane - changing rate , the duration of lane changes , the gap - acceptance behavior , or the propagation velocity of longitudinal density waves .",
    "the full potential of the data , i.e. , using the positional information together with that for velocity and acceleration , has hardly been tapped .",
    "a possible reason is that the velocity and acceleration information can not be used directly since the noise of the positional information is greatly increased by the necessary numerical differentiations . in this paper , we have developed a filter to extract more realistic velocity and acceleration information from the positional data . since the trajectories are comparatively short , we included the boundary regions in the filtered output by reducing the width of the necessary smoothing operations near the boundary .",
    "this implies determining the most efficient order of the smoothing and differentiation operations of the filter since they do no longer commute , and a wrong order may even lead to a systematic bias .",
    "it must be noticed that it is inherently difficult to determine the optimal filter parameters that eliminate most of the noise while retaining the real information .",
    "this is particularly crucial for mean - reverting quantities such as the accelerations , where large smoothing time intervals will eventually suppress the whole information .",
    "clearly , further research is necessary to develop more sophisticated , possibly nonlinear , filters .",
    "the velocity and acceleration information of the trajectories can be used in many ways . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the systematic errors in determining spatial quantities from temporal information , and vice versa .",
    "the background is that spatial quantities such as the gap to the leading vehicle , the density , or the times - to collision , are usually estimated by single - vehicle data from stationary detectors , i.e. , by using temporal information . using `` virtual stationary detectors '' that are fed with the trajectory data and simulating the estimation procedure",
    ", we could quantitatively determine the resulting estimation errors .",
    "besides the well - known underestimation of the real density of congested traffic , we found that the percentage of critical values of times - to - collision is underestimated by a factor of 2 and more when estimated from single - vehicle data .",
    "this clearly is relevant for safety - related applications .",
    "another application field are empirical tests and parameter calibrations for car - following and lane - changing models . in this work",
    ", we showed that , prior to a discretionary lane change , there is a noisy and small , but significant , velocity difference in favor of the target lane . from this , we conclude that lane - changing decisions are not only based on gaps and velocities , but also on velocity differences , and possibly , on accelerations as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more generally , the trajectory data allow , for the first time , to empirically investigate the strategical and tactical actions for preparing or facilitating a lane change  @xcite .",
    "apart from the actions of the lane - changing driver , this also includes the actions of the other drivers involved , such as cooperative actions of the follower on the target lane to allow zip - like merging .",
    "this is relevant for microscopic simulation software since it turned out to be notoriously difficult to model realistic lane changes , particularly in the case of mandatory changes in congested traffic .",
    "the acceleration information of the data can also be used to investigate to which extent the local traffic environment ( consisting , e.g. , of the next - nearest and further leading vehicles ) influences the longitudinal driving behavior  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that the driving style is influenced by the local velocity variance as determined from few leading vehicles  @xcite .",

    "<S> the ngsim trajectory data sets provide longitudinal and lateral positional information for all vehicles in certain spatiotemporal regions . velocity and acceleration information </S>",
    "<S> can not be extracted directly since the noise in the ngsim positional information is greatly increased by the necessary numerical differentiations . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a smoothing algorithm for positions , velocities and accelerations that can also be applied near the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the smoothing time interval is estimated based on velocity time series and the variance of the processed acceleration time series . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity information obtained in this way is then applied to calculate the density function of the two - dimensional distribution of velocity and inverse distance , and the density of the distribution corresponding to the `` microscopic '' fundamental diagram . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is used to calculate the distributions of time gaps and times - to - collision , conditioned to several ranges of velocities and velocity differences . by simulating `` virtual stationary detectors '' we show that the probability for critical values of the times - to - collision is greatly underestimated when estimated from single - vehicle data of stationary detectors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the lane - changing process and formulate a quantitative criterion for the duration of lane changes that is based on the trajectory density in normalized coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , there is a very noisy but significant velocity advantage in favor of the targeted lane that decreases immediately before the change due to anticipatory accelerations . </S>"
