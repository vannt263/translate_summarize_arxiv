    "strongly interacting matter is described at the fundamental level through the interaction of quarks by the exchange of gluons .",
    "this non - abelian gauge theory , called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , exhibits a number of remarkable features .",
    "( 1 ) at short distances or large momenta @xmath0 , the effective coupling constant @xmath1 decreases logarithmically , i.e. quarks and gluons appear to be weakly coupled . ( 2 ) at large distances or small momenta , the effective coupling becomes strong , resulting in the phenomena of quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "( 3 ) at low energies , the qcd vacuum is characterized by nonvanishing expectation values of certain operators , usually called vacuum condensates , which characterize the nonperturbative physical properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "most important for our discussion are @xcite :    * the quark condensate @xmath2 ( 235 mev)@xmath3 and , * the gluon condensate @xmath4 ( 500 mev)@xmath5 .",
    "the quark condensate describes the density of quark - antiquark pairs found in the qcd vacuum and is the expression of chiral symmetry breaking . the gluon condensate measures the density of gluon pairs in the qcd vacuum and is a manifestation of the breaking of scale invariance of qcd by quantum effects .",
    "it is not uncommon in nature that spontaneously broken symmetries are restored at high temperature through phase transitions .",
    "well known examples are ferromagnetism , superconductivity , and the transition from solid to liquid .",
    "more closely connected to our subject , nuclear matter at low temperatures has a dense liquid phase , which goes over into a dilute gaseous phase at @xmath6 mev .",
    "evidence for this phase transition has recently been seen in nuclear collisions at intermediate energies @xcite .    as the temperature increases in qcd , the interactions among quanta occur at ever shorter distances , governed by weak coupling , while the long - range interactions become dynamically screened .",
    "this picture is supported by finite temperature perturbation theory , showing that the effective coupling constant @xmath7 falls logarithmically with increasing temperature @xcite and also by more general arguments @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "nuclear matter at very high temperature exhibits neither confinement nor chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this new phase of qcd is called the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "since there exist order parameters , such as the quark condensate , which vanish at high temperature , there are good reasons to expect that the transition between the low - temperature and high - temperature manifestations of qcd is not smooth but exhibits a discontinuity , i.e. a phase transition .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition is believed to be quite sensitive to the number of light , dynamical quark flavors .",
    "universality arguments @xcite predict a second - order phase transition for two massless flavors and a first - order transition for three massless flavors .",
    "numerical simulations of the lattice gauge theory ( see section 2.1 ) have established the transition temperature to lie in the range @xmath8 mev at vanishing net quark density .    according to the standard cosmological model @xcite , the temperature of the cosmic background radiation exceeded 200 mev during the first 10 @xmath9 after the big bang .",
    "the early universe was hence filled with a quark - gluon plasma , rather than hadrons .",
    "hence , physical processes occurring during this very early period can be described in terms of quark and gluon transition amplitudes rather than hadronic amplitudes .",
    "this facilitates reliable calculations of transport processes , such as baryon number violating processes during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "chiral symmetry is also expected to be restored at high baryon density even at zero temperature .",
    "many model studies of this phenomenon have been performed , yielding critical densities @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the ground state density of nuclear matter .",
    "since ab - initio calculations based on lattice qcd are not feasible yet , the uncertainty of @xmath12 remains large .",
    "one expects a smooth connection between the high-@xmath13 and high-@xmath14 phase transitions , giving rise to a continuous phase boundary @xmath15 . for @xmath16 the effective description of strongly interacting matter at low momenta",
    "is in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom ( baryons and mesons ) , whereas for @xmath17 the effective degrees of freedom at low momenta carry the quantum numbers of quarks and gluons .",
    "it is important to recognize that this difference is only discernible at momenta below the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath18 1 gev@xmath19 . for processes involving momentum transfers above that scale light quarks are effectively massless and deconfined in either phase .",
    "an effective description above @xmath20 must , therefore , always be based on the elementary degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) .",
    "hence , experimental signatures for the change in the structure of strongly interacting matter must be sensitive to the dynamics of the low - energy degrees of freedom of qcd .",
    "quarks and gluons are already known to provide the correct description for momenta @xmath21 .",
    "quark - gluon plasma signals must probe the momentum range @xmath22 and show that current quarks and gluons remain effective degrees of freedom also in this range when @xmath17 .",
    "many speculations of additional phases of baryon - rich nuclear matter exist : pion condensates @xcite , density isomers @xcite , nuclear matter with a large strangeness content @xcite , and others . of these",
    ", kaon condensates and strange quark matter appear to be the best established . in some models of hadron structure it is not even possible to exclude that strange quark matter is the true ground state of nuclear matter @xcite . in other models ,",
    "strange quark matter may be unstable against weak decay , but stable under the strong interactions .",
    "the basic argument for an increased stability of strange matter is that the fermi energy can be lowered significantly by distributing the given baryon number of three quark flavors rather than only two .",
    "the price to be paid is the higher current quark mass of the strange quark and , possibly , the destruction of the color singlet structure of baryons .",
    "the energy balance for these different aspects is delicate , hence reliable predictions are impossible without a better knowledge of baryon structure in the framework of qcd .",
    "mechanisms for the separation of strange quark matter have been conceived in the environment of the early universe @xcite as well as in relativistic heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "while there exist rather strong astrophysical limits on the density of strange quark matter `` nuggets '' ( strangelets ) in our universe @xcite , the search for strange quark matter produced in heavy ion collisions has only just begun .",
    "the experimental signature for light multi - strange nuclei would be an abnormally low charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "lattice gauge theory @xcite allows for a potentially exact , nonperturbative numerical calculation of observables in qcd .",
    "improvements of the original algorithms , together with significant increases in computing power due to parallel processing , have permitted fairly reliable evaluations of the thermodynamic averages of many interesting quantities , which can be extrapolated to the infinite volume limit .",
    "state - of - the - art simulations of the finite - temperature lattice gauge theory employ lattices with spatial size @xmath23 and 4 points in the euclidean time direction @xcite .",
    "simulations of pure su(3 ) gauge theory without quarks are possible on much larger lattices , such as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the simulations without dynamical quarks clearly exhibit a first - order phase transition at a temperature of @xmath25260 mev .",
    "below @xmath26 the free energy of an isolated quark is infinite , above @xmath26 it is finite .",
    "hence quarks are not confined in the high - temperature phase .",
    "it is also possible to evaluate the quark condensate @xmath27 in the so - called `` quenched '' approximation , where the influence of quark - antiquark pairs on the qcd vacuum is neglected .",
    "this quantity shows a strong drop over the same temperature range ( see figure 1 ) , indicating that deconfinement and restoration of chiral symmetry go hand - in - hand .",
    "simulations of lattice qcd with dynamical quarks have not yet overcome the limitations due to finite lattice size .",
    "present results indicate a smooth cross - over between phases for @xmath28 light quark flavors and a first - order phase transition for @xmath29 .",
    "figure 2 shows recent results ( at @xmath28 ) for the energy density @xmath30 and pressure @xmath31 as a function of temperature .",
    "@xmath32 shows a dramatic rise .",
    "the thermal change in the pressure @xmath31 is much smoother , causing a large difference between @xmath33 and @xmath30 in the transition region .",
    "since @xmath34 is a measure of nonperturbative interactions , this shows that interactions continue to be influential and that the high - temperature phase is not simply a gas of quasi - free quarks and gluons in this temperature range .",
    "the effect can be successfully described assuming that the propagating degrees of freedom have an effective thermal mass @xcite      many of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma far above @xmath26 can be calculated in the framework of thermal perturbation theory . neglecting current quark masses , the equation of state up to order @xmath35",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the quark flavors and @xmath38 the quark chemical potential of each flavor .",
    "higher order corrections have been calculated for @xmath39 , up to order @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "various arguments can be made that @xmath41 should be taken at an effective momentum scale of the order @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 at the critical temperature , or @xmath44 .",
    "additional insight into the properties of the interacting quark - gluon plasma is obtained by considering the dispersion relations of small perturbations carrying the quantum numbers of quarks or gluons @xcite .",
    "these excitations govern the dissipation mechanisms in the quark - gluon plasma . for gluonic excitations ,",
    "one obtains two different modes , with transverse and longitudinal polarization , respectively .",
    "soft gluonic excitations , also called plasmons , carry an effective mass of order @xmath45 . the plasmon mode is strongly damped . in the limit @xmath46",
    "the plasmon decay width is @xmath47 , which provides an estimate for the thermalization time of a quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the static longitudinal gluon propagator is screened with screening mass @xmath48 , whereas the transverse propagator remains unscreened ( lack of magnetic screening ) .",
    "lattice simulations indicate a localization of static color - magnetic fields at the momentum scale @xmath49 .",
    "the screening of color - electric fields lies at the origin of the deconfinement of quarks at high temperature .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions are the most promising tool for creating a quark - gluon plasma in the laboratory .",
    "qcd predicts that energy density at midrapidity grows like @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the nuclear mass @xcite , but at most logarithmically with the center - of - mass energy . in order to reach temperatures far above @xmath26",
    ", the initial kinetic energy of the nuclei must be rapidly thermalized on a time scale of order 1 fm/@xmath52 .",
    "early ideas about the mechanism of energy deposition were based either on the inside - outside cascade model of parton scattering @xcite or the breaking of color flux tubes @xcite .",
    "more recently , detailed microscopic models have been constructed @xcite that permit the study of the energy deposition process in space - time as well as in momentum space , in the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "the models are based on the concept that the colliding nuclei can be decomposed into their parton substructure .",
    "the perturbative interactions among these partons can then be followed until thermalization .",
    "one finds that partonic cascades account for at least half the expected energy deposition at rhic and an even larger fraction in the energy range of the lhc @xcite .",
    "parton cascade models predict a very rapid thermalization of the deposited energy .",
    "this is caused by a combination of radiative energy degradation and separation of partons with widely different rapidities due to free - streaming .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of initially scattered partons is already to a high degree exponential if radiative processes are taken into account .",
    "free - streaming causes the local longitudinal momentum distribution of partons to coincide with the transverse distribution after a time approximately equal to the mean time between parton interactions .",
    "the models predict that thermalization occurs on a proper time scale of 0.30.5 fm/@xmath52 at rhic energies@xcite .",
    "due to the large cross sections and higher branching probabilities of gluons , the thermalized parton plasma is initially gluon rich and rather depleted of quarks @xcite .",
    "chemical equilibration of the parton plasma proceeds over a time of several fm/@xmath52 in most scenarios @xcite , but may be faster if higher - order qcd processes are important @xcite .",
    "another interesting issue concerns the homogeneity of initial conditions .",
    "partonic cascades can lead to a rather uneven energy deposition , because of cross section fluctuations .",
    "`` hot spots '' , caused by strongly inelastic parton scatterings could lead to observable , nonstatistical fluctuations in the final hadron distribution @xcite .",
    "after ( local ) momentum equilibration further evolution of the quark - gluon plasma to its final dissolution can be described in the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics . according to the results of parton cascade models , the initial conditions for this evolution in the central rapidity region are boost invariant to a large degree , as anticipated by bjorken @xcite .",
    "assuming purely longitudinal expansion , the temperature then falls as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the local proper time .",
    "cooling is substantially enhanced by the transverse expansion that is generated by the high internal pressure of the plasma , when the initial temperature is significantly above @xmath26 .",
    "typical estimates of the plasma lifetime are 4 fm/@xmath52 , after which a mixed quark - hadron phase is formed in a first - order phase transition @xcite . due to transverse expansion",
    ", however , even the mixed phase decays on a time scale of 10 fm/@xmath52 .",
    "the lifetime of the mixed phase could be longer , if the plasma were formed at the critical temperature , where the pressure is minimal @xcite .",
    "this is expected to occur at energies far below those accessible at rhic ",
    "likely between the current ags and sps energies  in a regime where our understanding of the thermalization mechanism is rather limited . a long - lived @xmath55 fm/@xmath52 ) mixed phase could be detected by its effect on two - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach becomes invalid when the typical distance between particles exceeds the mean free path .",
    "this happens rather shortly after the quark - hadron phase transition , when the temperature falls below @xmath56 mev @xcite .",
    "since various hadrons have different mean free paths , the freeze - out is differential with k@xmath57-mesons freezing out first , followed by nucleons , k@xmath58 and , finally , pions .",
    "experimental investigations of the quark - gluon plasma require the identification of appropriate experimental tools for observing its formation and studying its properties .",
    "one serious problem is that the size and lifetime of the plasma are expected to be small , at most a few fermi in diameter and perhaps 5 to 10 fm/@xmath52 in duration .",
    "furthermore , signals of the quark - gluon plasma compete with backgrounds emitted from the hot hadronic gas phase that follows the hadronization of the plasma , and are modified by final state interactions in the hadronic phase . in spite of this , a wealth of ideas has been proposed in the past decade as to how the identification and investigation of the short - lived quark - gluon plasma phase could be accomplished .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this review to present a comprehensive survey of quark - gluon plasma signatures .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on the most promising ones .",
    "more details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the basic concept behind this class of signatures is the determination of the energy density @xmath30 , pressure @xmath31 , and entropy density @xmath59 of superdense hadronic matter as a function of the temperature @xmath13 and the baryochemical potential @xmath60 .",
    "one seeks to observe a rapid rise in the effective number of degrees of freedom , as expressed by the ratios @xmath61 or @xmath62 , over a small temperature range .",
    "measurable observables that are related to the variables @xmath13 , @xmath59 , and @xmath30 , are customarily identified with the average transverse momentum @xmath63 , the hadron rapidity distribution @xmath64 , and the transverse energy @xmath65 , respectively @xcite .",
    "one can , in principle , invert the @xmath30-@xmath13 diagram of figure 2 and plot @xmath63 as a function of @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "if a rapid change in the effective number of degrees of freedom occurs , one expects an s - shaped curve , whose essential characteristic feature is the saturation of @xmath63 during the persistence of a mixed phase , continuing into a second rise when the structural change from color - singlet to colored constituents has been completed .",
    "the high pressure of the quark - gluon plasma leads to the formation of a collective outward flow during the expansion of the dense matter .",
    "detailed numerical studies in the context of the hydrodynamical model have shown that this characteristic transverse flow of particles is rather weak in realistic models @xcite .",
    "the strength of this signal can be enhanced by studying higher moments of the momentum distribution , or heavier hadrons such as baryons @xcite .",
    "the transverse flow signal would be enhanced by the formation of a detonation wave during the hadronization transition @xcite .",
    "identical particle interferometry , e.g. @xmath66 , kk , or nn correlations , yields information on the reaction geometry and provides important information about the space - time dynamics of nuclear collisions . by studying the two - particle correlation function along various directions in phase space ,",
    "it is possible to obtain measurements of the transverse and longitudinal size , of the lifetime , and of flow patterns of the hadronic fireball at the moment when it breaks up into separate hadrons @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work has shown the importance of the finite lifetime of the fireball @xcite , of flow patterns @xcite , and of shadowing effects @xcite . since",
    "interferometric size determinations will be possible on an event - by - event basis for collisions of heavy nuclei at the sps , rhic , and lhc , the correlation of global parameters like @xmath63 and @xmath64 with the fireball geometry can be performed on individual collision events .",
    "photons and lepton pairs provide probes of the interior of the quark - gluon plasma during the earliest and hottest phase of the evolution of the fireball since they are not affected by final state interactions .",
    "unfortunately , these probes have rather small yields and must compete with relatively large backgrounds from hadronic processes , especially electromagnetic hadron decays .    in the hadronic phase , the electromagnetic response function is dominated by the @xmath67 resonance at 770 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbative qcd predicts a broad continuous spectrum above twice the thermal quark mass @xmath68 in the high temperature phase .",
    "below 100 mev collective modes are predicted to exist in both phases .",
    "many of the original calculations on lepton pairs as probes of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite concentrated on invariant masses in the range below the @xmath14-meson mass . with an improved understanding of the collision dynamics and the hadronic backgrounds @xcite",
    ", it has since become clear @xcite that lepton pairs from the quark - gluon plasma can probably only be identified for invariant masses above @xmath69 gev . at the high - mass end",
    ", the yield of drell - yan pairs from first nucleon - nucleon collisions exceeds the thermal dilepton yield .",
    "recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of thermalization has revealed that the yield of high - mass dileptons critically depends on , and provides a measure of , the thermalization time @xcite .",
    "lepton pairs from the equilibrating quark - gluon plasma may dominate over the drell - yan background up to masses in the range @xmath70 gev , as predicted by the parton cascade @xcite and other models of the early equilibration phase of the nuclear collision @xcite .",
    "if this turns out to be true , the early thermal evolution of the quark - gluon phase can be traced in a rather model independent way @xcite .",
    "dileptons from charm decay are predicted to yield a substantial contribution to the total dilepton spectrum and could , because of their different kinematics , provide a measure of the total charm yield @xcite , which may be enhanced due to rescattering of gluonic partons @xcite , if the direct background @xcite is sufficiently well understood .",
    "lepton pairs from hadronic sources in the invariant mass range between 0.5 and 1 gev are important signals of the dense hadronic matter formed in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "they provide exclusive information about possible medium modifications of hadronic properties , especially of the @xmath14-meson , at high density @xcite .",
    "another strategy for using the leptonic @xmath14-meson decay as a probe of the hadronic phase of the fireball is based on the idea that the @xmath14-peak is expected to grow strongly relative to the @xmath71 peak in the lepton pair mass spectrum , if the fireball lives substantially longer than 2 fm/@xmath52 .",
    "because of the short average lifetime of the @xmath14-meson , the @xmath72 ratio can therefore serve as a fast `` clock '' for the fireball lifetime @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lepton - pair spectrum the hadronic radiation spectrum is not concentrated in a single narrow resonance . the dominant source of photons from the thermal hadron gas is the @xmath73 reaction @xcite , to which the broad @xmath74 resonance may be an important contribution @xcite . in the quark",
    "phase the scattering process @xmath75 dominates .",
    "infrared singularities occurring in perturbation theory are softened by screening effects @xcite .",
    "the result is that a hadron gas and a quark - gluon plasma in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath26 emit photon spectra of roughly equal intensity and similar spectral shape .",
    "however , a clear signal of photons from the quark - gluon plasma could be visible for transverse momenta @xmath76 in the range @xmath77 gev/@xmath52 if a very hot plasma is formed initially @xcite .",
    "the photon spectrum in the @xmath78 range @xmath79 gev/@xmath52 is mostly emitted from the mixed phase .",
    "transverse flow effects make the separation of the contributions from the different phases more difficult @xcite , and destroy the correlation between the slope of the photon spectrum in the intermediate @xmath78 range and the temperature of the mixed phase @xcite .",
    "the suppression of @xmath80 production @xcite in a quark - gluon plasma occurs because a @xmath81 pair formed by fusion of two gluons from the colliding nuclei can not bind inside the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations of su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite show that this condition should be satisfied already slightly above the deconfinement temperature .",
    "the screening length appears to be even shorter when dynamical fermions are included in the lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "excited states of the @xmath82 system , such as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are more easily dissociated and should disappear as soon as the temperature exceeds @xmath26 . for the heavier @xmath85 system",
    "similar considerations apply , although shorter screening lengths are required than for the charmonium states @xcite .",
    "the dissociation temperature of the @xmath86 ground state is predicted to be around 2.5 @xmath26 , that of the larger @xmath87 state only slightly above @xmath26 .",
    "owing to its finite size , the formation of a @xmath82 bound state requires a time of the order of 1 fm/@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath80 may still survive , if it escapes from the region of high density and temperature before the @xmath81 pair has been spatially separated by more than the size of the bound state @xcite .",
    "this will happen either if the quark - gluon plasma cools very fast , or if the @xmath80 has sufficiently high transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the charmonium may also be destroyed by sufficiently energetic collisions with comoving hadrons , leading to dissociation into a pair of @xmath88-mesons @xcite .",
    "dissociation via quark exchange with mesons composed of light quarks , such as the @xmath14-meson , has been estimated in a nonrelativistic quark model @xcite to reach several mb .",
    "similar values are obtained , if @xmath80 production is fed by a large fraction of easily absorbed color - octet @xmath82 states @xcite .",
    "additional effects that can contribute to @xmath80 suppression even in hadron nucleus interactions are nuclear shadowing of soft gluons , initial state scattering of partons resulting in a widened transverse momentum distribution , and final state absorption on nucleons @xcite .",
    "suppression mechanisms based on interactions with comoving particles generally predict that the @xmath83 state should be more strongly suppressed than the @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "this holds equally for a quark - gluon plasma as for a comoving thermalized gas of hadrons .",
    "the production of hadrons containing strange quarks is normally suppressed in hadronic reactions compared with the production of hadrons containing only up and down valence quarks @xcite .",
    "this suppression increases with growing strangeness content of the produced hadrons .",
    "when a quark - gluon plasma is formed , the production of hadrons carrying strange quarks is expected to be saturated because the strange quark content of the plasma is rapidly equilibrated by @xmath89 pair production in interactions of two gluons @xcite . as a result",
    ", the yield of multi - strange baryons and strange antibaryons is predicted to be strongly enhanced in the presence of a quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "in addition , the relative abundances of the various strange particle species ( mesons , strange and multi - strange baryons , and their antiparticles ) allow the determination of relative strangeness equilibrium , saturation in the overall strangeness content ( @xmath90 ) , and strangeness neutrality in a thermo - chemical approach @xcite . these ratios can be calculated assuming either a hadron gas scenario or a quark - gluon plasma scenario , and a comparison can be made of the values extracted from the models in the two scenarios in conjunction with other thermodynamic variables of the system , such as the temperature @xmath13 , the baryo - chemical potential @xmath91 , and the entropy @xcite .    because strange hadrons interact strongly , their final state interactions have to be modeled in considerable detail , before firm predictions about strange hadron yields are possible .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite have shown that an enhanced strangeness content can not be destroyed nor generated by interactions during the break - up phase .",
    "fragmentation processes during the hadronization phase transition can contribute significantly to the final abundances of strange hadrons @xcite , but this does not invalidate the usefulness of strangeness enhancement as a plasma signature .",
    "the temporary restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear collisions may result in the formation of domains of disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) @xcite .",
    "this term describes a coherent excitation of the pion field corresponding to a local misalignment of the chiral order parameter @xmath92 .",
    "such domains would decay into neutral and charged pions , favoring pion charge ratios @xmath93 substantially different from one - third .",
    "this could explain why final states with a large fraction of charged pions over neutral pions , observed in centauro events @xcite , can occur with significant probability @xcite .",
    "a dcc can be described as a nonlinear wave in the sigma model @xcite .",
    "such a wave can be excited by the growth of local instabilities during the transition from the chirally restored high - temperature phase of qcd to the low - temperature phase , in which chiral symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "the growth of long wavelength modes in the chiral order parameter then occurs quite naturally , if the transition proceeds out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this picture has been partially confirmed in numerical calculations based on the linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "as the coherence length is inversely proportional to the growth rate of the instabilities @xcite , larger domains of coherently excited pion field may emerge if the chiral order parameter is somewhat , but not far , away from its equilibrium value , as is likely to occur in a relativistic heavy ion reaction @xcite .",
    "initial deviations from isospin neutrality do not necessarily destroy the usefulness of this probe @xcite .",
    "the observation of pion charge ratios significantly different from @xmath94 , or nonzero charge correlations @xcite , would therefore be a direct signature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "domains of disoriented chiral condensate may also contribute to antibaryon production through the formation of topological defects in the chiral order parameter @xcite .",
    "such defects can arise at the intersection of chiral domain walls , which carry baryon number and eventually evolve into baryons and antibaryons , possible leaving a signature of the chiral phase transition in regions of phase space that are normally baryon - poor @xcite .",
    "the widths and positions of the @xmath95 , and @xmath96 peaks in the lepton - pair spectrum are sensitive to medium - induced changes of the hadronic mass spectrum , especially to the possible drop of vector meson masses preceding the chiral symmetry restoration transition @xcite . in the absence of high baryon density , modifications of the peak positions",
    "are predicted to be small except in the immediate vicinity of the phase transition , whereas the increase in the width of the @xmath96-meson due to collision broadening is substantial @xcite .",
    "this could serve as a measure of the density of the mixed phase @xcite .",
    "a change in the k - meson mass also would affect the width of the @xmath96 meson @xcite .",
    "a double @xmath96 peak in the lepton pair spectrum would be indicative of a long - lived mixed phase @xcite .",
    "the color structure of qcd matter can be probed by its effects on the propagation of a fast parton @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms are similar to those responsible for the electromagnetic energy loss of a fast charged particle in matter : energy may be lost either by excitation of the penetrated medium or by radiation .",
    "the connection between energy loss of a quark and the color - dielectric polarizability of the medium can be established in analogy to the theory of electromagnetic energy loss @xcite .",
    "although radiation is a very efficient energy loss mechanism for relativistic particles , it is strongly suppressed in a dense medium by the landau - pomeranchuk effect @xcite .",
    "the qcd analog of this effect has recently been analyzed comprehensively @xcite .",
    "adding the two contributions , the stopping power of a fully established quark - gluon plasma is predicted to be higher than that of hadronic matter .",
    "a quark or gluon jet propagating through a dense medium will not only lose energy but will also be deflected .",
    "this effect destroys the coplanarity of the two jets from a hard parton - parton scattering with the incident beam axis @xcite .",
    "the angular deflection of the jets also results in an azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "the presence of a quark - gluon plasma is also predicted to enhance the emission of jet pairs with small azimuthal opening angles @xcite .",
    "the sharp increase in the acoplanarity of di - jet events in proton - nucleus interactions recently observed at fermilab @xcite indicates that the interpretation of these signals is complicated by re - interaction .",
    "the techniques used in experiments studying relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions are similar to those used in high energy physics experiments .",
    "the primary difference is that the particle multiplicities and the backgrounds for various processes differ between the nuclear and particle physics environments . for central collisions , with impact parameters near zero",
    ", the particle multiplicities scale approximately as the mass of the colliding system and therefore , with nuclear masses around 200 , can be a factor of 200 times higher in collisions of heavy nuclei compared to collisions between protons at the same energy .",
    "the multiplicities scale weakly as a function of energy with @xmath97 .",
    "likewise , the combinatorial backgrounds underlying processes such as drell - yan production , particle and resonance decays , and photon production increase more than linearly with ( and usually as the square of ) increasing primary particle multiplicities , complicating reconstruction of these signals .",
    "there are presently two research facilities for relativistic heavy ion experiments , focusing on dense hadronic matter and signatures of quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "these are the brookhaven alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) and the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) , both in operation with heavy ions since 1986 .",
    "experiments utilize nuclear beams ranging from protons to gold with momenta up to @xmath98 gev/@xmath52 from the ags and from protons to lead with momenta up to @xmath99 gev/@xmath52 from the sps , where @xmath100 is the element number and @xmath51 is the atomic mass number of the nuclear beam .",
    "these correspond to center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "the collisions occur with a target in the laboratory frame , in contrast to colliding beams .",
    "the products are focused toward forward angles in the laboratory .",
    "for example , mid - rapidity ( @xmath101 ) corresponds to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , at the ags and sps respectively , for the majority of particles emitted with less than 1 gev/@xmath52 transverse momentum . to study particles emitted in the mid - rapidity region ,",
    "the experiments require compact , highly segmented detectors placed in the forward regions downstream from the target .",
    "the particle momenta are relatively high due to the lorentz boost of the center - of - mass into the laboratory frame making particle identification via ionization energy loss and time - of - flight more difficult .",
    "particles at mid - rapidity have momenta in the relativistic rise region , thus energy loss measurements require larger numbers of samples along tracks @xcite and exceptional track separation capabilities .",
    "there are two colliders planned for acceleration of heavy ions to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , presently under construction at brookhaven national laboratory in new york , is a dedicated heavy ion collider planned for experiments in 1999 .",
    "rhic will accelerate and collide ions from protons to heavy nuclei , such as au at c.m .",
    "energies up to 500 gev for protons and 200 gev per nucleon - pair for au nuclei .",
    "the luminosity for au+au will be 2 x 10@xmath104 @xmath105 s@xmath106 .",
    "near head - on collisions of au+au at rhic are expected to produce from 500 to 1500 charged particles per unit pseudorapidity at midrapidity in a single collision .",
    "large detector systems are being constructed @xcite to analyze the products of these interactions for formation of a quark - gluon plasma and a possible chiral phase transition .",
    "heavy ion physics research @xcite will also be an integral part of the program for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , to be constructed at cern , the european centre for nuclear physics , in geneva , switzerland . for pb nuclei , the c.m .",
    "energies at the lhc will be 5.4 tev per nucleon pair with luminosities of 10@xmath107 @xmath105s@xmath106 .",
    "predictions for the charged particle densities at the lhc for near head - on collisions of pb+pb range from 2000 to 8000 per unit pseudorapidity .",
    "the large uncertainty in these numbers arises primarily from the present lack of information on the distributions of soft gluons in nuclei @xcite .",
    "the types of detectors anticipated for use in the collider experiments can be divided into four categories : detectors for charged particle tracking , calorimeters for energy measurements ; detectors for particle identification ; and photon detectors .",
    "in contrast to the high energy physics environment , at the heavy ion colliders 1 ) the @xmath76 of the particles of interest is typically lower ; 2 ) the luminosities are considerably lower , allowing the use of slower detectors and readout times ; while 3 ) the particle multiplicities are considerably higher requiring finer segmentation of detectors and larger event sizes .    tracking detectors",

    "measurements close to the primary interaction are particularly important for detecting decays of short - lived strange and charm particles , of extreme importance in quark - gluon plasma searches . for large area tracking away from the interaction region and at more moderate particle densities of @xmath108 1 @xmath105",
    ", time - projection chambers and other types of tracking detectors are used @xcite .",
    "the calorimeters used at the heavy ion colliders will be of two basic types .",
    "conventional sampling calorimeters @xcite can be used for electromagnetic and hadronic energy determination , and measurements of jets .",
    "highly segmented calorimeters can be used , in addition to the above measurements , to measure high energy particles and photons .",
    "new types of calorimeters @xcite with fine segmentation and various types of readout have recently been designed and tested for use in the high track density environments at heavy ion colliders .",
    "particle identification of charged particles can be accomplished using ionization energy loss , cerenkov radiation , transition radiation , or time - of - flight techniques . at higher momenta ,",
    "combinations of these techniques are sometimes necessary for best results , especially when measuring over a wide range of @xmath76 over which any single technique may not be applicable .",
    "highly segmented photon detectors will be utilized for the measurement of photon radiation .",
    "detectors from new types of materials have been developed @xcite for higher efficiencies and with smaller molire radius to be able to improve performance and to more finely segment photon detector systems .",
    "there are various types of detector systems that will be utilized at the heavy ion colliders . for illustration",
    ", we will briefly point out three , and describe the measurements they allow .",
    "hadron spectrometers utilize tracking detectors , detectors for particle identification and magnetic fields to determine particle types and their momenta . such spectrometers measure momentum ( and rapidity )",
    "distributions for a large variety of identified particles , including decays of particles and resonances . for larger acceptances particle correlations can be measured .",
    "the phobos @xcite and brahms @xcite experiments planned for rhic are examples of these .",
    "for very large acceptances , approaching complete solid angle coverage , measurements of single event observables can be performed . the star experiment @xcite under construction for rhic and the alice experiment @xcite planned for the lhc are examples .",
    "such measurements will be unique to the high multiplicity heavy ion experiments .",
    "examples of single event observables are the strangeness content ; temperatures of pions and kaons derived from the spectra or mean transverse momenta ; event shapes and source sizes ; and energy , momentum and particle number fluctuations as a function of emission direction .",
    "the purpose is to link these observables to thermodynamic variables and other dynamical properties of the evolving system and thus gain information on the dynamical evolution and state of the system .",
    "an additional aspect of large acceptance spectrometers is the ability to measure jets .",
    "lepton pair spectrometers typically measure @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "they focus primarily on the lepton - pair mass spectrum over the entire mass range available , leptonic decays of hadronic resonances ( including the @xmath80 and higher mass resonances when possible ) , and the drell - yan background . here again a magnetic field is utilized for momentum measurements along with arrays of detectors for tracking and particle identification .",
    "the phenix experiment @xcite under construction for rhic is an example .",
    "besides using various techniques to distinguish particle pairs from the decays in the primary heavy ion interaction , it is also important to differentiate between particle pairs produced in the primary interaction and those produced in secondary processes away from the primary vertex .",
    "since the yields of higher mass pairs are low and the branching ratios for the electromagnetic decays to @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are small @xmath113 compared to hadronic decays modes , suppression of hadronic background sources relative to the electromagnetic signals ( by factors of @xmath114 ) requires excellent tracking and particle identification using various combinations of detectors .",
    "highly segmented photon spectrometers seek to measure direct photon radiation from the the various phases of matter formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "such measurements require very elaborate detection systems to suppress the photons from neutral pion decay and electron conversion in order to measure the direct photons .",
    "the extraction of weak direct photon signals from the background requires a detailed understanding and careful analysis of systematic errors , understanding and subtraction of the combinatorial background , and an understanding of the sensitivity to the various decay backgrounds .",
    "in addition to the efficiencies , the multiplicity dependence of the identification of the various particles creating the backgrounds must be understood .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma has yet to be uniquely observed or identified .",
    "there are , however , experimental observations that require for their description more than our present understanding of the standard model of hadronic interactions .",
    "some require modifications to existing microscopic models , due primarily to the high density environment of these reactions , others are more easily described by models incorporating deconfined quarks and gluons . in this section",
    ", we will place into perspective the present understanding of the data and review briefly new features which affect this understanding .",
    "an emphasis on the qgp signatures and those observations which require more than hadronic interactions for their description will be made .",
    "the status of the experimental results at these center - of - mass energies , @xmath115 gev , was last summarized in this journal in 1992 @xcite . since that time",
    "there has been significant progress in understanding the interactions of nuclei at high energy .",
    "this is a result of recent sophisticated measurements , availability of heavy nuclear beams , accumulation of systematic data , and improved theoretical model calculations .",
    "the nuclear stopping power is a measure of the degree to which the energy of relative motion of two incident nuclei can be transferred into other degrees of freedom .",
    "the amount of nuclear stopping determines basic parameters , such as energy and volume of the interaction region and thus energy density , which govern the reaction dynamics and the extent to which conditions are favorable for the formation of a deconfined phase .",
    "experiments determine the stopping power of colliding nuclei from 1 ) the redistribution of the incident protons into proton final - state rapidity distributions ; 2 ) measurements of the energy remaining in the forward - going baryons , which carry the initial energy into the reaction ; and 3 ) measurements of the transverse energy distributions which represent the energy transformed into produced particles and their kinetic motion .",
    "many systems have been studied at the ags and the sps to determine the nuclear stopping power .",
    "the rapidity distributions for protons from pp interactions @xcite and peripheral nucleus - nucleus interactions at the ags @xcite and sps @xcite energies are peaked forward and backward in the c.m .",
    "frame , near the projectile and target rapidities , exhibiting a small degree of stopping . for central collisions of two intermediate mass nuclei ( @xmath116 )",
    "the proton rapidity distributions spread over the entire rapidity space with broad peaks approximately half - way between the target / projectile and the c.m .",
    "rapidities , thereby exhibiting a fairly large amount of stopping at both energies @xcite .",
    "the distributions for the heavy systems ( mass @xmath117 ) at both energies peak and exhibit a `` pile - up '' of matter at midrapidity @xcite .",
    "the heavier systems are more efficient at stopping the incoming matter and thus higher energy densities are expected to be reached when colliding these heavier nuclei .",
    "the measured rapidity distributions of protons and produced particles at the ags energy can be reproduced by the arc cascade model @xcite .",
    "this model describes the nuclear reaction as a sequential binary cascade of interactions among known hadrons , neglecting all medium effects on the hadron - hadron cross sections .",
    "this is not sufficient at the higher sps energies , especially for the proton distributions .",
    "the rapidity distributions of protons from central collisions of 160 a - gev/@xmath52 pb+pb exhibit a considerably higher degree of stopping than predicted by models based on binary hadron interactions with free - space cross sections , such as hijing @xcite , venus @xcite and fritiof @xcite .",
    "there apparently exist important mechanisms for the transfer of baryon number that are not incorporated in binary cascade models . in order to successfully describe the measured rapidity distributions of baryons at sps energy ,",
    "cascade models have had to incorporate novel reaction mechanisms involving multi - hadronic intermediate states , such as color ropes in rqmd @xcite or multi - quark clusters in venus @xcite .",
    "the presence of these effects must be viewed as a result of the high density .",
    "they show that nuclear collisions at sps energies require a description that goes beyond conventional hadronic interaction physics .",
    "the transverse energy e@xmath118 distributions have also been measured to determine the degree of nuclear stopping in central heavy ion collisions at the ags and sps .",
    "measurements of e@xmath118 at the ags @xcite have shown that the e@xmath118 increases fifty percent more rapidly , in going from si + al to au + au , than predicted from an independent nucleon - nucleon interaction model .",
    "an interpretation of this increase in a microscopic model ( arc ) @xcite is that there is a considerable increase in the baryon density , up to ten times normal nuclear density , and an accompanying large increase in the volume of high density matter when going from si+al to au+au at the ags @xcite .",
    "at the sps , measurements of e@xmath118 in central collisions of 160 a - gev/@xmath52 pb+pb @xcite exhibit a large amount of energy transfer into particle production .",
    "the accompanying energy density was estimated to be 3 gev / fm@xmath3 , similar to the results obtained for 200 a - gev/@xmath52 s+au central collisions @xcite but over a larger volume .",
    "the overall degree of nuclear stopping is found to be large in collisions of heavy systems at both the ags and sps energies .",
    "there is a significant build - up of baryon and energy density over a large volume and considerable energy transfer from the initial relative motion into particle production , suggesting that conditions may be favorable for thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the application of thermodynamic concepts to multiparticle production has a long history . strictly speaking",
    ", the concept of temperature applies only to systems in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath . in high energy interactions the kinetic energy of the longitudinal motion , along the beam axis , serves as an energy reservoir .",
    "thermalization is normally only thought to occur in the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions measured in nucleus - nucleus collisions reflect conditions at the time when interactions cease ( freeze - out ) . due to the large re - interaction cross sections for hadrons",
    "the distributions do not reflect earlier conditions , as in a hot and dense deconfined phase , when chemical and thermal equilibrium may have been established .",
    "it is therefore not feasible to extract a temperature from the slopes of hadron spectra and relate to it an observable of the high density phase , such as entropy or energy density .",
    "prior to this a better understanding of the effects on the spectra of final state interactions and collective flow is necessary .    a discussion of the systematics of the slopes of the spectra of various particles and colliding systems measured at the",
    "ags and sps has been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the momentum spectra for the light , produced particles are not thermal , and have significant deviations both at low @xmath76 ( @xmath120 0.25 gev/@xmath52 ) and at high @xmath76 ( @xmath121 1.0 gev/@xmath52 ) .",
    "a collective nuclear flow component has been measured in azimuthal energy distributions at the ags @xcite .",
    "this evidence for collective flow clearly underlines the need for a better understanding and description of the phenomenon .",
    "it is also necessary to incorporate collective flow in models and to be able to subtract its effects in any extraction of temperatures from spectra .",
    "the measured transverse momentum and transverse mass distributions are consistent with a thermal description at freeze - out , only if additional collective radial flow and feeding from higher - lying resonances are taken into consideration .",
    "data measured at the ags for 14.6 a - gev/@xmath52 si+au @xcite are compatible with thermal distributions including transverse flow with temperatures @xmath122 mev and mean transverse flow velocities 0.33 @xmath123 0.39 over this range of temperatures @xcite . thermal fits including resonance decays and transverse flow for sps data in central s+w collisions are consistent with t = 160 mev and a transverse flow with average velocity @xmath124 0.41 @xcite .",

    "hadron emission would have to proceed far off equilibrium , possibly reflecting thermal conditions in a pre - hadronic phase of the reaction . ]",
    "the consistency of the assumption of particle emission from a locally thermalized source can be tested by using a thermo - chemical model to describe the ratios of the various emitted particles .",
    "this yields a baryon chemical potential @xmath60 , a strangeness chemical potential @xmath127 and a temperature @xmath13 at chemical freeze - out , which can be compared to the temperatures derived from the particle spectra . of specific interest",
    "are strange particles and anti - baryons , whose production is predicted to be enhanced @xcite if a chiral phase transition occurs in a dense , baryon - rich system .    an enhancement in the production of strange particles has been observed and measured for various systems in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the ags @xcite and the sps @xcite , compared to proton - proton and proton - nucleus interactions . it should be noted that some increase in the production of strange hadrons , especially kaons and @xmath128-hyperons , in nucleus - nucleus collisions can result from purely hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the enhancement in the @xmath128 yield measured over a large rapidity interval @xcite is difficult to describe by a cascade of hadronic interactions . a clear enhancement in the production of @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 hyperons @xcite has been measured at the sps .",
    "to be able to describe this enhancement severe modifications must be introduced to the hadronic cascade models invoking precursors of quark - gluon plasma formation such as creation of color ropes @xcite , breaking of multiple - strings @xcite , or decay of multi - quark droplets @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 from the ags are consistent with an equilibrated hadronic fireball with @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath134 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ratios @xcite measured at the sps have been reproduced in an equilibrium hadron gas description with @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "the sps strange particle data have also been described by an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma , with strangeness neutrality ( @xmath143 = 0 ) and large strangeness saturation ( @xmath144 ) which hadronizes and decays instantaneously @xcite .",
    "further experimental information is necessary to differentiate between the hadron gas and quark - gluon plasma descriptions of the strange particle ratios .",
    "two - particle interferometric techniques @xcite have been used to study the space - time evolution of the colliding system and to provide information for testing and understanding dynamical models . pions and kaons will freeze out late in the expansion and will provide information on the system in its later stages . in experiments at sps energies",
    "the radii extracted from @xmath145 and @xmath146 interferometry measurements @xcite are the same indicating that the interactions of the kaons with the expanding matter are predominantly @xmath147 interactions @xcite .",

    "the radii derived from @xmath66 interferometry are consistently larger than those from kk measurements @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed @xcite at the higher energies to effects of resonance decays @xcite in addition to the differences in @xmath148-hadron and k - hadron interaction cross sections .",
    "studying the source sizes derived from correlation measurements of each of the particle species provides information on the space - time evolution of the expanding source .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse radii measured in central collisions at the sps are considerably larger than the projectile radius , thus reflecting a large amount of expansion of the system in the final stage before freeze - out @xcite .",

    "the transverse source radii are expected to decrease as a function of increasing transverse momentum in the presence of transverse flow @xcite .    in a detailed comparison of a model calculation with the measured data",
    ", a correlation is observed between a particle s momentum and position at the time of freeze - out @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the assumption of the absence of kinematic correlations required for the correlation function analysis is not completely realized and that shadowing and flow effects are important to include in interpreting the data .",
    "an overall picture of the source in the late stage of the collision emerges from the @xmath66 correlation measurements .",
    "it is one of a pion - emitting source which expands longitudinally in a boost invariant way , with a slight transverse expansion which increases with the mass of the colliding system .",
    "the volume of the expanding source at freeze - out is proportional to the rapidity density of produced particles , suggesting that freeze - out occurs at a constant density @xcite . at sps energies the time between the onset of expansion and freeze - out along the longitudinal direction is approximately 5 fm/@xmath52 and a small difference between the transverse components",
    "is observed indicating a short duration , not more than 2 fm/@xmath52 , for particle emission @xcite . to date , all measurements of the two transverse radius components of the source , which are distinguishable if a long - lived intermediate phase were to exist , have been identical .",
    "thus no long - lived intermediate state has yet been observed in the correlation measurements @xcite .      at temperatures and densities just below that of a quark - gluon plasma , nuclear matter",
    "is expected to exist in the form of highly excited resonance matter .",
    "microscopic calculations @xcite predict that during central collisions at ags energies , the central rapidity region becomes compressed to high densities , is highly excited and baryon - rich @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the baryons in central collisions at ags energies will be in excited states @xcite , forming what might be called baryonic resonance matter .",
    "this is consistent with a recent measurement of the @xmath149 resonance population at the time of freeze - out in central collisions at the ags @xcite and results of rqmd , which find that 35 percent of the final - state nucleons are excited to the @xmath149 resonance at the time of freeze - out .",
    "excitation to higher energies at the sps , rhic and the lhc should lead to the formation of highly excited resonance matter .",
    "excitation of higher - lying resonances provides a means of converting energy from the relative motion thereby increasing the rate of equilibration .",

    "@xcite has reported a 5.8%  photon signal over background with a 5%  systematic error .",
    "thus preliminary experimental results are consistent with one another within experimental errors , and a significant direct photon yield has yet to be established .      a suppression of @xmath80 @xcite and @xmath83 @xcite production relative to that of the drell - yan continuum has been measured for central collisions in nucleus - nucleus experiments at the sps .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath83 is observed to be larger than that of the @xmath80 in central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "such suppression @xcite is predicted to result from color screening of the @xmath154 pair in a deconfined medium .",
    "it has also been predicted to occur as a result of final - state interactions in a dense hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "a similar suppression has also been seen in @xmath80 production in hadron - nucleus interactions @xcite and @xmath109-nucleus interactions @xcite , lending credence to a hadronic mechanism to describe the observed suppression .",

    "there is presently no unambiguous explanation for the suppression of @xmath80 and @xmath83 in the various interactions in which they have been measured .",
    "however , theories describing the suppression of @xmath80 and @xmath83 in nucleus - nucleus collisions require the formation of comoving high - density matter , be it hadronic or deconfined matter . better knowledge of the various mechanisms for interactions of the @xmath80 in hadronic matter and deconfined matter , as well as initial and final state interactions , is important to understanding the suppression .",
    "future experiments will study properties of high _ baryon _ density in collisions of the heaviest systems at the ags and sps , and high _ energy _ density with heavy systems at rhic and lhc . more information on collective flow at the",
    "ags and sps will emerge from the comparison of correlation measurements with single particle spectra and from calculations using microscopic models .",
    "the goal of these investigations will be to better understand the effects of flow on other observables",
    ". this will be essential for a knowledge of the space - time evolution of the system and subsequently for determining the entropy , temperature and chemical potentials of the system in the high density phase .",
    "furthermore , the energy dependence of strangeness and entropy production should be measured in the energy regime from the ags through the sps energies , to understand the presently observed differences in the strangeness and entropy at the two energies and to search for a possible onset of a phase transition at moderate to high baryon density .",
    "studies with the heavy systems , especially at higher energies , will provide unprecedented energy densities , where effects of the quark - gluon plasma and chiral transitions are expected .",
    "one of the most interesting characteristics of the new experiments will be to make use of the increased multiplicities in the heavy systems at sps and higher energies to extract thermodynamic properties ( t , @xmath60 , s , @xmath127 , @xmath30 , etc . ) of the system on an event - by - event basis @xcite .",
    "this enables categorization of individual events into groups according to thermodynamic properties and could potentially lead to the isolation of events with special properties associated with quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "ensembles of these events could then be studied in greater detail to determine their particular characteristics .",
    "new measurements using electromagnetic probes to study heavy colliding systems at higher energy densities , at the sps and at the higher energies of rhic and the lhc , should provide important new results .",
    "the observation of an excess of lepton pairs in the low and intermediate mass region from three different experiments at the sps requires further experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "there are differences in the measurements which must be understood .",
    "better statistics are needed to be able to understand the dependence of the excess on invariant mass and on collision centrality . for low mass electron pairs , there appears to be a threshold at @xmath156 , a quadratic dependence on rapidity density , and the excess is observed over a broad mass range .",
    "these facts suggest that the excess may be due to @xmath157 pair annihilation in a dense medium .",
    "the excess above the @xmath14 , which is similar to the open charm contribution , might be explained by enhanced production of charm .",
    "new results using the heavy systems at the sps should provide an even stronger enhancement of the lepton - pair yields , if the excess seen so far is due to effects of a dense hadronic medium . at rhic and the lhc , higher",

    "is necessary in order to reduce the systematics to the level required for measuring signals only a few percent above background .",
    "theoretically , it will be very important to understand the relationship between the large excess of low mass electron pairs ( virtual photons ) and a weak direct photon signal .",
    "since the transverse mass and momentum distributions of hadrons contain effects due to resonance production , decays , expansion , and collective flow , it would be extremely interesting to utilize noninteracting probes , such as photons , to measure the temperature of the high density phase .",
    "clearly , a consistent picture between these results and the temperature derived from the observed particle ratios would be both gratifying and most convincing .",
    "further studies of the relative suppression of @xmath80 and @xmath83 at the sps in central collisions of very heavy nuclei should provide crucial information on the relative roles of nuclear rescattering , color screening and deconfinement at the highest energy densities .",
    "measurement of @xmath80 and @xmath83 in a+p interactions using reverse kinematics to measure the @xmath80-hadron rescattering cross sections will be important to understanding the role of rescattering in the break - up of the @xmath80 and @xmath83 .",
    "this is an essential step toward isolating the suppression due to screening in a quark - gluon plasma",
    ". it will be important to vary the projectile and target masses to determine the a - dependence of the various processes for a complete understanding of the suppression .    at the higher incident energies of rhic and the lhc",
    ", the energy densities will be more than a factor of ten greater than in present measurements at the sps .",
    "thus the differences in the @xmath80 , @xmath83 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 suppression and the screening due to quark - gluon plasma formation should be accentuated .",
    "effects of a high density nuclear , hadronic or deconfined medium on the mass and width of the light vector mesons will be investigated in central collisions of very heavy ions at the ags , sps , rhic and the lhc .",
    "this should provide information on possible resonance mass and width modifications due to the high density medium and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "another characteristic of a chiral phase transition would be the observation of abnormal ratios of charged to neutral pions .",
    "this will be investigated in event - by - event measurements at higher densities in central collisions of the heavy systems at the sps , rhic and lhc .      because a significant fraction of the interactions at rhic and the lhc will be in the perturbative regime , it is important to measure the distributions of the incident partons in nuclei and the nuclear shadowing in collisions of nuclei .",
    "deep inelastic scattering of leptons from nuclei has provided measurements of the quark distributions in nuclei . however",
    ", direct access to the gluon distributions will require measurements of p+a interactions .",
    "comparisons of similar measurements in a+a interactions will provide the understanding of nuclear shadowing necessary to calculate these interactions at the microscopic level .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to measure open charm at the sps and at higher energies .",
    "since the initial stages of the collisions at rhic and lhc are expected to be dominated by gluons , open charm production is expected to be enhanced .",
    "measurement of the amount of open charm will provide information on the initial stages of the collision , prior to formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "collisions at rhic and the lhc will exhibit effects of hard scattering of partons . such qcd hard scattering processes will result in the production of high @xmath76 particles and jets which will be measured in experiments at rhic and the lhc to test the propagation of high @xmath76 partons in highly excited matter and a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "new and more sensitive searches for the h - particle ( neutral , doubly - strange dibaryon ) and strangelets have begun at the ags @xcite and sps @xcite . these experiments seek to provide the first spectacular observations of such particles or at a minimum to set stringent limits on their production cross sections .",
    "such measurements would provide important input into model calculations for the quark structure of nuclei , quark - gluon plasma formation , cosmology and stellar evolution .",
    "in this review we have described the various signatures that have been proposed for quark - gluon plasma formation and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "these signatures are being pursued vigorously in experiments at the present day relativistic heavy ion accelerators , the ags and sps , and in the construction of relativistic heavy ion experiments for rhic and the lhc .",
    "figure 3 provides an overview of the various signatures that have been described in this review and their expected behavior as the energy density ( as measured by the transverse energy density ) increases through the critical energy density @xmath158 .",
    "large changes are anticipated as the energy density of the transition is traversed .",
    "the searches for signatures of the quark - gluon plasma at the ags and sps have provided an interesting initial study of the behavior of these signatures as the critical energy density is approached from below . to date , no unambiguous signal of the quark - gluon plasma or the chiral transition has been seen",
    ". however , several experimental results are incompatible with predictions of models based on established knowledge about interacting hadrons . in particular",
    ", we note the observation of a substantial enhancement of strange ( anti-)baryon yields and an increased emission of lepton pairs in the mass region below the @xmath14-meson .",
    "these results may indicate that a quark - gluon plasma or mixed phase is formed in some interactions or regions of interactions at sps energies , or that hadron masses are substantially reduced during these reactions .",
    "it will be up to future investigation to determine this .",
    "analysis of the observed hadron spectra and yields has provided evidence that the system , at the moment of break - up , is in a state of local equilibrium not far from the predicted phase boundary between hadron and quark matter , corresponding to @xmath159 mev , @xmath160 mev at the sps and @xmath161 mev , @xmath162 mev at the ags .",
    "if the present theory and models are correct , and equilibrium is reached at an even earlier stage ( than freeze - out ) of the reaction , at a minimum a quark - hadron mixed phase is formed at the sps .",
    "this spells exceptional promise for experiments at the future heavy ion colliders , where the full specter of quark - gluon plasma signatures can be measured , many on an event - by - event basis .    the success of thermal models in describing the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra , and ratios of various particles has led to a general understanding of the reaction dynamics at these energies .",
    "the freeze - out temperatures that have been measured are in the range @xmath163 mev , using best fits to the transverse momentum spectra which require a moderate amount of transverse flow , @xmath164 .",
    "the quark chemical potentials are in the range from @xmath165 mev for the sps energies and @xmath166 mev for the brookhaven ags energies .",
    "these measurements can be used to determine the region of the phase diagram of nuclear matter that is being investigated in these interactions .",
    "the resulting data are shown superimposed on a schematic phase diagram of nuclear matter in figure 4 . in studying this diagram ,",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the freeze - out temperatures are those observed in the particle spectra after interactions cease . in deriving these temperatures",
    "effects of flow and resonance production and decay have been taken into consideration .",
    "temperatures at earlier times during the interaction must have been higher .",
    "this has been seen in the results of microscopic , hadronic cascade calculations .",
    "the collision evolves from initial nuclear densities and temperatures to higher densities and temperatures prior to expansion and cooling ( denoted by the arrows for the ags and sps measurements ) to the final freeze - out values observed in the experiments .",
    "it is the goal of the field of heavy ion physics to explore the various regions of the phase diagram of nuclear matter ( figure 4 ) and to map out its properties at these various temperatures and pressures .",
    "it is of special interest to relativistic heavy ion physics to investigate regions of higher temperatures and densities for formation of a quark - gluon plasma and a chiral phase transition .",
    "the new relativistic heavy ion collider experiments will search for the signatures ( figure 3 ) of these phase transitions , and measure observables which reflect variables of the state of the system , in order to determine the characteristics of nuclear matter at high densities .",
