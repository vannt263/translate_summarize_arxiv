    "moreover , a few recent experiments have reported the observation of zero - bias peaks in such systems , @xcite which are in good agreement but not completely consistent with the existence of these majorana fermions .",
    "such experimental observations have been shown to also have simpler explanations because a zero bias peak could also arise without any majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies have studied the properties of the topological wire when in contact with an homogeneous sc substrate @xcite . however , the effect of an inhomogenous sc on the majorana states has received less attention @xcite . in a previous work ,",
    "we have also studied the andreev bound states ( abss ) which arise in such a wire when it is end contacted with superconductors .",
    "these states , which are a reminiscence of the quantized modes of the nanowire in the normal state @xcite can mutate into majorana fermions ( mfs ) @xcite .    in this article",
    "we make use of a more universal approach allowing one to characterize quite generally the proximity of various superconducting substrates . in this approach",
    "the proximity effect is induced by a local hopping term between the wire and the sc substrate .",
    "we analyze the differences between the predictions of this model and those of the more widely used one in which the proximity sc gap induced in the wire is added by hand as a constant pairing term .",
    "this general formalism allows us to describe the abss which arise in the topological wire in the proximity of the sc substrate , as well as their evolution into mfs when the spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman field are turned on .",
    "moreover , other properties of the superconducting substrate such as disorder , can be easily take into account in this approach .",
    "thus , we apply our model to an s - wave superconductor with a finite broadening of the sc coherence peaks , consistent with a finite quasiparticle lifetime @xcite .",
    "we study the effect of this finite lifetime , as well as of the tunneling rate between the superconductor and the wire on the formation of majorana states .",
    "we show that increasing the tunnel coupling induces a topological transition which splits the zero - energy majorana peak ; interestingly enough , this peak can in certain conditions reform by increasing the quasiparticle broadening , but this happens only for a very finely tuned regime of parameters , and it is unlikely to have observable experimental consequences .",

    "since the total hamiltonian is quadratic in the sc degrees of freedom , we can integrate out these modes , such that the effect of the sc substrate is taken into account by dressing the bare green s function of the nanowire by a superconducting self - energy @xmath16 the total retarded superconducting self - energy can be written as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the unity matrix in the space of sites , and @xmath19 the on - site retarded superconducting self - energy given by @xmath20    the local self energy depends on the tunneling amplitude @xmath21 as well as on the retarded green s function for the superconducting bulk electrons and can be written as @xcite @xmath22 where * 1 * is the unity matrix in spin / particle - hole space , and @xmath23 is the tunneling rate .",

    "we consider also that we are in the regime @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the superconducting coherence length and @xmath38 the length of the nanowire .",
    "we focus first on the qualitative features of the proximity effect induced by the tunnel coupling with the sc substrate , and on the differences with the model in which the pairing term is put `` by hand '' directly in the nanowire @xcite . as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : ind_gap]a , in the latter case a superconducting gap @xmath39 is induced in the nanowire ( in absence of zeeman field and rashba spin - orbit coupling ) .",

    "the gap reopens and is topological in nature , and two majorana states form at zero energy .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling localizes the two majorana states more and more at the two ends of the nanowire .",
    "when the proximity effect is modeled via a hopping term , in the absence of a zeeman field and of rashba spin - orbit coupling , a gap - like feature also appears at an energy @xmath39 , which can be described as a sc pseudo - gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ind_gap]b )",
    ". however , inside this gap we note the formation of abss , the number of these states being determined by the ratio between the inverse nanowire length @xmath41 and the size of the gap ( i.e. the energy difference between two abss is proportional to @xmath41)@xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ ldos - abs ] we have plotted the ldos as a function of energy and position for various parameters in order to characterize the evolution of abs . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field , these abss have a uniform weight along the wire ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : ind_gap]b corresponds to an energy cut of fig .",

    "localizes these states towards the ends of the wire ( see fig .",
    "[ ldos - abs]b ) , even in the non - topological state .",
    "including a zeeman field breaks the spin degeneracy and splits each of these states .",
    "the two abss come closer and closer with increasing the magnetic field until when , for a certain value of @xmath8 , and in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , they merge ( note this merging is also controlled by the chemical potential ) ( see fig .",
    "[ ldos - abs]c ) and form two majorana states . increasing",
    "the spin - orbit coupling localizes these states more and more towards the ends of the wire ( see fig .",
    "[ ldos - abs]d ) .",
    "thus we see that the proximity effect induced via the tunnel coupling between the sc and the nanowire also allows for the formation of localized majorana modes , which can be seen evolving from the andreev bound states in the wire .    in order to understand how these majorana states are formed in a more quantitative manner",
    ", we analyze the effective hamiltonian induced in the wire via the coupling with the superconducting substrate .",
    "thus , we note that if we focus on the low - energy sector where we expect the majorana modes to form , the self - energy induced in the wire is equivalent with an effective sc gap which can be evaluated by setting the energy to zero in the second term in eq .",
    "( [ supercond_green ] ) , yielding @xmath42 .",
    "it is this effective gap which governs the transition to a non - topological phase when the zeeman field becomes smaller than a critical value , @xmath43 .",
    "alternatively seen , for large values of @xmath44 a transition to a non - topological phase occurs . in terms of the tunnel coupling between the sc and the wire the corresponding condition to exit the topological phase is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46",
    "this can be checked numerically , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : tran_amprate0 ] we have plotted the ldos at one end of the nanowire as a function of the energy and @xmath47 . indeed , we note that for values of @xmath47 larger than @xmath48 the majorana peaks split in two , marking the exit from the topological phase .",
    "we have checked that the energy difference @xmath49 between these abss depends linearly on @xmath47 .    .",
    "the dashed line denotes the transition between a topological and non - topological state which occurs at @xmath50 ( with our parameters).,width=226 ]    we also note that for very small tunnel coupling parameters the majorana states are also split ; this behavior can be explained by the fact that in this regime the superconductivity has not sufficiently penetrated the nanowire to have a real superconducting gap . by increasing the nanowire length",
    "the splitting of the majorana states occurs for smaller and smaller values of @xmath47 , confirming that this is a finite size effect ; for large nanowire lengths we obtain a robust zero bias peak even for very small transmission rates .",
    "while we do not detail it here , this formalism allows one to consider also a non - uniform tunneling rate which corresponds to disorder at the interface between the wire and the superconducting substrate .",
    "such disorder yields a position dependent effective superconducting gap in the wire , and the majorana modes are destroyed for large disorder strengths .",
    "this general formalism allows us to model also a disordered as well as an inhomogenous superconductor .",
    "such properties can be encoded in the sc green s function via the superconducting self energy .",
    "we first use our model to study the effect of a finite quasiparticle broadening which is phenomenologically taken into account via a non - zero energy imaginary part @xmath51 , @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ supercond_green ] ) @xcite .",
    "this broadening models a finite quasiparticle lifetime , and is characterized by a smoothed bcs gap at @xmath53 and by the presence of states inside the sc gap .     .",
    "we take @xmath54 in the main plot ( no topological transition with varying @xmath51 ) and in the inset we take @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ( a majorana peak is expected to form when @xmath58 ) .",
    ", width=226 ]    in terms of the broadening parameter @xmath51 , the new effective gap becomes @xmath59 , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ supercond_green ] ) , and the condition to have a topological phase is given by @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath51 for which the transition takes place depends essentially on the difference @xmath61 . for large magnetic fields @xmath62",
    "the topological condition is satisfied for all values of @xmath51 , and no transition to a non - topological state is possible . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tran_amprate ] we have plotted the ldos of a majorana peak ( i.e. the ldos on the first site of the wire ) as a function of energy and @xmath51 in this regime .",
    "note that indeed we can not identify any topological transition , however the majorana peaks widen and get dissolved in the bulk when @xmath51 becomes of the same order of magnitude as the sc gap .",
    "this is not very surprising as for such strong pair - breaking the bcs dos is smoothed out and becomes similar to that of a normal metal , and our system behaves as a topological wire in the non - sc ( `` normal '' ) regime ( no majorana modes ) .",
    "when @xmath63 the majorana fermions do not form for @xmath64 , however , for certain parameter values chosen such that @xmath65 is small with respect to the topological gap ( @xmath47 very close to @xmath48 , large @xmath8 with respect to @xmath39 ) there exists a transition to a topological phase with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "finding the range of parameters in which this can be realized requires fine tuning , and in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : tran_amprate ] we have illustrated such a situation ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , for which a phase transition exists and the majorana peak reforms for @xmath66    we focus also on an inhomogenous superconductor consisting of regions with different tunnel couplings between the wire and the sc , as well as with different quasiparticle broadenings .",
    "in particular we consider a superconductor containing three regions , a central region in the topological phase ( @xmath67 , @xmath64 ) , and two exteriors ones for which the quasiparticle broadening as well as the tunnel coupling can be tuned such that the regions are in either the topological or the non - topological phase . when all regions are in topological phase , we restore a well - known case where we only have two majorana states localized at the ends of the nanowire .",
    "when only the central region is in the topological phase , two majorana fermions form at the extremities of the central part .",
    "an interesting situation is that of two exteriors regions with very strong broadening . in this kind of configuration , the exteriors regions are quasi - normal , and we recover the behavior described in ref .   for sn junctions , i.e. , two majorana fermionic states extended over the entire `` normal '' parts , as well as over a broad energy range .",
    "our approach can also be applied to other kinds of disorder such as magnetic disorder .",
    "indeed , magnetic impurities strongly modify the excitations spectrum of the superconductor , as it has been shown for the first time by abrikosov and gorkov @xcite . in principle , this type of disorder can be treated by solving the usadel equations in order to obtain the associated green s function of the superconductor in presence of a finite density of magnetic impurities@xcite .",
    "the resulting green s functions need then to be injected in our formalism ( see eq .",
    "( [ supercond_green ] ) to recover an effective local self - energy in the wire , and allow one to test for the formation and destruction of majorana fermions as a function of disorder .",
    "however , solving such equations is a complex task , involving both numerical and analytical techniques , which we believe is a research subject in itself , and well beyond the scope of the present work ; this subject will be addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have used a general approach to describe the proximity effect induced in a semiconducting nanowire connected to a superconducting substrate via a tunnel coupling .",
    "we have described the evolution of the abss into mfs when turning on the spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman field in the wire .",
    "we have also shown that the nanowire can reach a non - topological phase for strong values of the tunneling rate between the sc and the wire . moreover , we have applied our method to study the effects of the disorder in the superconductor on the physics of the majorana fermions in the wire .",
    "in particular we have focused on the effects of quasiparticle broadening , and we have found that a finite quasiparticle lifetime can also take the system through a topological phase transition in a finely tuned range of parameters . finally , we have shown that majorana states can form in an inhomogenous superconductor .",
