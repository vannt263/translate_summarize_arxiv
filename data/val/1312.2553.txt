    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence at high reynolds numbers can organize spontaneously into large - scale and long - lived coherent structures of jets and vortices .",
    "coherent structures are ubiquitous in nature with well - known examples such as the great red spot on jupiter , the great dark spot on neptune , jets in the atmosphere and the gulf stream and kuroshio current in the oceans . numerical simulations and experiments",
    "show that despite the co - existing presence of complicated turbulent behavior , many features of coherent states are independent of details of the initial conditions , suggesting the possibility of interpreting coherent states as statistical equilibria .",
    "several statistical mechanical formulations of 2d inviscid flows have been constructed that treat the fluid system either as a collection of point vortices @xcite or more satisfactorily as a continuous field @xcite .",
    "see references @xcite for reviews .",
    "direct numerical simulation of high - reynolds - number turbulence suffers from the problem that a formidably large range of length scales must be resolved  often beyond the capacity of the most powerful supercomputers currently available .",
    "numerical simulations that can only resolve structures that are larger than the dissipative scale typically use subgrid models of the unresolved fluid motion such as hyperviscosity @xcite .",
    "equilibrium statistical mechanics offers an alternative to numerical simulation . among several such descriptions ,",
    "the continuous - field approach proposed by miller @xcite and robert and sommeria @xcite , henceforth designated mrs , is the most satisfactory . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to gain deeper insight into both numerical simulation and mrs descriptions of evolving 2d euler flows by comparing coherent states found in numerical simulation with mrs equilibria .",
    "the mrs equilibrium statistical mechanical description is based on the observation that inviscid 2d euler flows develop finer and finer structures as time evolves .",
    "mrs coarse - grains the vorticity field below a small length scale @xmath0 , which represents spatial averaging that removes fine structures that drop below resolution scale @xmath0 in simulations .",
    "continuous space is discretized into small cells of side @xmath0 , with each cell labeled by a position vector @xmath1 .",
    "only the information about the local probability distribution @xmath2 of the vorticity @xmath3 remains after the coarse - graining operation , and what is observed is the mean field @xmath4 the assumption that the system is described by one - point statistics @xmath2 neglects any statistical correlations between the fine - grained fields in different cells .",
    "equilibrium is determined by the least - biased local probability distribution that is consistent with the prior knowledge that the fine - grained flow is the 2d euler flow conserving all the invariants of the dynamics .",
    "that goal is achieved by maximizing the shannon information entropy @xmath5=-\\int \\rho(\\bi{r } , \\sigma ) \\ln\\rho(\\bi{r } , \\sigma)~ \\rmd^2 \\bi{r } \\rmd\\sigma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while conserving mean - field energy per unit mass @xmath6 \\equiv \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle   \\bi{u}^2 \\rangle$ ] ( @xmath7 denotes a spatial average ) and an infinite number of fine - grained casimirs @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the mean velocity field determined by the curl of the mean streamfunction @xmath10 .",
    "the first ( @xmath11 ) and the second ( @xmath12 ) casimirs are called the circulation @xmath13 and the enstrophy respectively .",
    "the conservation of the casimirs reflects the invariance of 2d euler equation under the group of area - preserving diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "the exactness of the mean - field approach to the microcanonical measure of the 2d euler equation can be established by large - deviation theory @xcite .",
    "the mean - field energy is exact due to the long - range nature of the interaction between vorticity at different positions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there have also been attempts to use the mrs theory outside of the context of purely 2d flows , such as quasi - geostrophic flows ( see @xcite for example ) or the shallow - water equations ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "as explained below , mrs descriptions that impose conservation upon only a finite subset of the infinite number of casimirs are of both theoretical and practical interest .",
    "the idea was first clearly stated by naso @xcite .",
    "we introduce the notation mrs - n to refer to descriptions that maximize the entropy subject to a finite number of constraints , namely that all casimirs up to @xmath14 are conserved .",
    "constraints on higher order casimirs are not imposed .",
    "it is frequently hypothesized that linear invariants such as circulation and momentum , and quadratic invariants such as energy and fine - grained enstrophy , suffice to describe coherent structures in 2d high - reynolds - number turbulence , whereas the third and higher fine - grained casimirs are irrelevant for constraining large - scale behavior . some earlier attempts to describe coherent structures used the spectrally - truncated euler equation that respected only the conservation of the linear and quadratic invariants .",
    "kraichnan constructed a statistical mechanics for such a truncated system conserving only energy and enstrophy , and found an infrared divergence in the energy spectrum for negative temperatures @xcite .",
    "that hints at the main feature : the inverse cascade @xcite leads to the formation of coherent structures , and energy condensates into the largest scales .",
    "note that for simplicity in this paper , we do not worry about distinguishing the concepts of the infrared divergence in the energy spectrum , the condensation of energy at the largest scales , and the inverse cascade of energy , because they roughly describe the same evolution picture of 2d turbulence .",
    "similar phenomenon that energy condensates at the largest scales is also predicted using an entirely different approach , the variational principle of minimum enstrophy ( me ) as developed by bretherton and haidvogel @xcite and leith @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological approach minimizes enstrophy while holding energy fixed and captures the physics of the inverse energy cascade process as well as selective decay @xcite .",
    "recent work by naso , chavanis and dubrulle @xcite demonstrated the equivalence between the two approaches : the mrs-2 description that conserves energy , circulation , and fine - grained enstrophy is equivalent to the phenomenological me principle , when there are no other nontrivial conservation laws .",
    "the present paper considers 2d flows both on the torus and the sphere , for which in addition to energy and the casimirs there exist further conservation laws that reflect the symmetry of the domain , namely , linear momentum on the torus and angular momentum on the sphere .",
    "spherical geometry can lead to new physics due to the additional invariant of angular momentum and the properties of spherical harmonics ; however in the past , only a few studies have addressed statistical equilibrium on the sphere @xcite , while most others have focused on the planar geometry . here by generalizing the proof of naso @xcite to the sphere ,",
    "we demonstrate that mrs-2 with these additional constraints is still equivalent to the me principle .",
    "that mrs-2 yields the same type of solution as me under the additional conservation of the @xmath15-component and the norm of the angular momentum on the sphere was also noted recently by herbert @xcite .",
    "mrs-2 thus captures the physics of the inverse energy cascade and describes a complete condensation of energy into the lowest eigenmodes of the laplacian , in agreement with kraichnan s energy - enstrophy theory , lim s spherical model of energy - enstrophy - circulation theory @xcite and also bouchet and corvellec s microcanonical energy - enstrophy theory @xcite .",
    "the inverse cascade tendency of energy can also be derived from just the conservation of energy and enstrophy of the 2d inviscid flows , but under an additional assumption that the variance of the energy spectrum will increase as nonlinear interaction continually spreads energy over a greater range of wavenumbers ( for example see pages 580  581 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is reflected in the mrs-2 description , because both the broadening of the energy spectrum and the maximization of the mixing entropy are only different manifestations of the same irreversibility .",
    "whether or not mrs-2 can also describe other features of coherent structures remains to be investigated .",
    "the question may be framed in a different way : what are the large - scale statistical effects of imposing higher fine - grained casimir constraints ?",
    "previous theoretical studies mostly either conserve all the casimirs such as mrs or discard the higher casimir constraints beyond enstrophy @xmath16 , partly for the sake of mathematical simplicity .",
    "although several justifications can be made to motivate the idea of considering mrs-2 or equivalently a linear vorticity - streamfunction relationship instead of the full mrs description with various shapes of the vorticity - streamfunction curve ( see @xcite for a good summary ) , it is of theoretical interest to understand the information contained in the higher casimir constraints .",
    "the idea of maximizing the entropy while conserving only a finite number of casimirs was first clearly stated by naso , and they suggested keeping more and more fine - grained casimirs among the constraints as a practical way to go beyond mrs-2 @xcite .",
    "the present paper follows this approach and studies a first - order perturbation theory that weakly imposes the fine - grained cubic and quartic casimir constraints in mrs-2 .",
    "( the highest order @xmath17 of casimir constraint in mrs - n has to be even for the equilibrium local vorticity probability distribution @xmath2 to be normalizable . )",
    "perturbative imposition of the @xmath18 constraint in mrs-2 will be called perturbative mrs-4",
    ". there also exists a different perturbative approach to go beyond mrs-2 , namely the strong mixing expansion where the energy constraint is weakly imposed in the mrs theory @xcite .",
    "the statistical importance of the cubic and quartic casimirs in the strong mixing regime is shown in equation ( a 11 ) of the reference @xcite .",
    "some numerical experiments have also addressed the effects of the cubic and quartic casimirs @xcite .",
    "abramov and majda @xcite investigated how large - scale equilibrium statistical behavior changes as the higher casimirs are varied using a numerical algorithm that conserves many casimirs , confirming the importance of the cubic casimir .",
    "they further speculated that the fourth and higher casimirs are less important .",
    "a similar study carried out by dubinkina and frank @xcite used a different numerical algorithm that conserves the infinite set of casimirs points to the relevance of both the cubic and the quartic casimirs .",
    "( to distinguish such conservative simulations from numerical simulation with hyperviscosity , we refer to the former as `` conservative simulation '' and the latter as `` non - conservative simulation '' . )",
    "recently an alternative statistical mechanical formalism , the generalized - entropy description , has been proposed by ellis @xcite and further studied by chavanis @xcite and other authors .",
    "these authors argued that for real situations with small - scale forcing and dissipation , the conservation of all the invariants of the 2d euler equation is abusive .",
    "there are two categories of conserved quantities in mrs .",
    "the first category only receive contribution from the coarse - grained mean field , and we will refer to these as `` mean - field conserved quantities '' .",
    "the kinetic energy and circulation belong to this category .",
    "the second category of conserved quantities depend both on the coarse - grained mean field , and on the fine - grained fluctuations , and thus are affected by the small - scale processes .",
    "these will be referred to as the `` fluctuation - dependent conserved quantities '' with examples such as the fine - grained enstrophy @xmath16 and the higher fine - grained casimirs .",
    "ellis @xcite suggested conserving only the robust mean - field constraints such as energy and circulation , while treating canonically the fragile fluctuation - dependent constraints by fixing the lagrange multipliers instead of the fine - grained casimirs @xmath19 themselves .",
    "assumptions about the infinite set of multipliers may be made to reduce the complexity of the problem .",
    "equivalently a judicious choice for the form of the prior probability distribution @xmath20 may be made to represent the effects of forcing and dissipation .",
    "the approach maximizes the relative entropy with respect to the prior distribution @xmath21 = -\\int   \\rho \\ln ( \\rho / \\chi)~ \\rmd^2 \\bi{r } \\rmd\\sigma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under robust mean - field constraints such as energy and circulation .",
    "this is the same as maximizing a generalized entropy in @xmath22-space as proposed by chavanis @xcite",
    "-\\int \\rmd^2 \\bi{r } s(\\bar\\omega ) , \\label{generalizeds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while conserving the robust mean - field constraints @xcite . here",
    "@xmath24 is a convex function determined by the prior @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "bouchet and simonnet approximated it as @xmath25 in the limit of small energy when there is no asymmetry between positive and negative vorticity .",
    "they studied bifurcations in the flow topology in the limit of weakly forced and dissipative turbulence using a first - order perturbation theory that assumes that the parameter @xmath26 is small @xcite . when @xmath26 vanishes , the generalized - entropy approach is the same as the me principle .",
    "first - order perturbative mrs-4 as investigated here is the microcanonical version of this first - order perturbative generalized - entropy method .",
    "the two descriptions , when applied to 2d flows on the square torus , agree on the vorticity - streamfunction relationship but disagree on lifting of degeneracy by the first - order correction .",
    "a thorough discussion of the generalized - entropy description in the limit of small energy can be found in the reference @xcite .",
    "a similar perturbation theory has also recently been studied by loxley and nadiga in the context of freely - decaying turbulence @xcite .",
    "euler flows also serve as a test problem for the development of methods to address the problem of modeling high - reynolds - number atmospheric and oceanic turbulence .",
    "such flows develop finer and finer structures by stretching and straining vortices .",
    "vorticity filaments quickly drop below the resolution scale as time evolves . that the subgrid physics couples to the resolved structures calls for proper subgrid modeling in the numerical scheme .",
    "hyperviscosity is the simplest and most widely used subgrid model@xcite .",
    "other high - wavenumber filters are also used ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "these high - wavenumber dissipative models absorb enstrophy near the grid scale to mimic the loss of resolved enstrophy as enstrophy - containing filaments become too fine to resolve .",
    "they are necessary to maintain stability of numerical integration in some cases @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of using these artificial dissipative models instead of the ordinary newtonian viscosity is that they are more scale selective , dissipating only at the smallest scales , and thus effectively increase the operational range of resolved length scales .",
    "the inertial - range features and the large - scale structures of high - reynolds - number simulations are insensitive to the form of the small - scale dissipation . for simplicity",
    "the present paper focuses on hyperviscosity rather than other forms of small - scale dissipation .",
    "note that different powers of the laplacian operator may be chosen : higher exponents are more scale selective , while an exponent of 1 is equivalent to ordinary newtonian viscosity . in the present paper",
    "we only study biharmonic dissipation ( exponent 2 ) but we have verified that the large - scale coherent structures that form are insensitive to the precise exponent .",
    "a comparison of the behavior of different exponents can be found in the reference @xcite .",
    "although hyperviscosity is widely used , it is still unclear whether it correctly models the conservative properties of the exact flow .",
    "real - space or spectral inviscid simulations without subgrid modeling fail to conserve the third and higher casimirs , and hyperviscosity may help restore the dynamical effects of these conservation laws .",
    "we adopt the working hypothesis that a subgrid model that properly models the conservative properties of 2d euler flows is equivalent to mrs coarse - graining . the coarse - grained mean field and the fine - grained fluctuations in mrs correspond to the resolved and unresolved structures in the simulations respectively .",
    "if hyperviscosity models the correct conservative properties , and if the flow is also ergodic , coherent states produced in numerical simulation with hyperviscosity should agree with those found in mrs equilibria . now in the absence of hyperviscosity , an inviscid spectral simulation that fails to conserve the third and higher casimirs may still approach energy - enstrophy equilibrium ( see @xcite and references therein ) . if numerical simulation with hyperviscosity agrees with mrs-4 better than mrs-2 , that may be taken as evidence in support of the idea that hyperviscosity helps to restore some of the conservative properties .",
    "the approach of comparing the simulation coherent structures with statistical mechanics encounters two practical difficulties , namely the initial value problem and the breakdown of ergodicity .",
    "calculation of mrs - n equilibrium requires as input information the values of the conserved quantities .",
    "the initial value problem refers to the impossibility of measuring the fluctuation - dependent conserved quantities of the underlying euler flow because the flow is only partly resolved in non - conservative simulations .",
    "mean - field conserved quantities such as the kinetic energy and circulation of the underlying euler flows are directly measurable and their conservation is approximately respected in the non - conservative simulations , whereas the fluctuation - dependent conserved quantities such as the second and higher fine - grained casimirs can not be directly related to observation in non - conservative simulations . to determine the values of the fluctuation - dependent quantities , the corresponding coarse - grained observables @xmath27 may be used as an approximation .",
    "the coarse - grained casimirs @xmath28 are the mean - field part of the fine - grained casimirs and can significantly differ from the fine - grained casimirs .",
    "how to initialize the values of fluctuation - dependent conserved quantities poses a serious problem for higher - order mrs - n descriptions .",
    "intuitively one expects smaller difference between fine - grained and coarse - grained quantities when there is a larger scale separation between the energy containing scale and the grid scale . since the energy containing scale increases over time by the inverse cascade , the coarse - grained casimirs better approximate the fine - grained ones at later times .",
    "brands @xcite showed how mrs equilibrium varies with the integration time in one simulation of 2d evolving turbulence on the square torus .",
    "they integrated the 2d euler equation with added viscosity forward in time , calculated the mean fields of mrs equilibria using the resolved coarse - grained vorticity fields at different integration times and compared these fields to the late - time coherent state obtained in the same simulation .",
    "they found that the mrs mean field strongly depends upon the time at which the values of the conserved quantities are measured , and the agreement becomes good after a relatively short initial period of violent mixing has passed .",
    "low - order mrs - n suffers less from the initial value problem than full mrs because differences between the fine - grained and coarse - grained casimirs are amplified at higher order .",
    "as explained below , mrs-2 is unaffected by the initial value problem because its equilibrium mean field is independent of the fine - grained enstrophy values , but mrs-4 depends on the values of @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "the other difficulty is the breakdown of ergodicity . to alleviate this problem ,",
    "only features of coherent structures that are insensitive to details of the initial conditions are studied .",
    "ensemble averages over various initial conditions can be used to ascertain the robust features @xcite , but here we simply compare different runs without doing a formal ensemble average .",
    "the breakdown of ergodicity also indicates that the power of statistical mechanical descriptions to predict late - time quasi - stable states in numerical simulation is limited .",
    "real flows are inevitably subject to forcing and dissipation and are out - of - equilibrium to varying degrees . in some cases fluids",
    "may be sufficiently close to the equilibrium of a conservative system to be explained by statistical mechanics , but the question of how to best incorporate into equilibrium statistical mechanics the effects of forcing and dissipation is not resolved .",
    "non - equilibrium statistical mechanics may be required @xcite .",
    "we discuss this point further at the end of the paper .",
    "numerical simulations of the 2d euler equation with hyperviscosity on the square torus and the sphere ( both non - rotating and rotating ) are performed starting from random states with approximate symmetry between positive and negative vorticity .",
    "numerical simulation reveals three equilibrium - like features :    1 .",
    "a dipole of opposite vortices is found on the torus . on the non - rotating sphere",
    ", a quadrupole of 2 positive and 2 negative vortices appears @xcite .",
    "[ obs1 ] 2 .   on both surfaces the radial vorticity profile of each coherent vortex , @xmath29 ,",
    "is sharply peaked at the vortex center .",
    "the peak is a manifestation of a nonlinear @xmath30-like relationship between the vorticity and streamfunction .",
    "[ obs2 ] 3 .   on the rotating sphere ,",
    "the degree of anisotropy and the most energetic wavenumbers depend on the rate of rotation @xcite .",
    "[ obs3 ]    similar findings have been obtained in previous work on the torus @xcite and on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the above three observations may be compared with mrs-2 and perturbative mrs-4 .",
    "mrs-2 equilibria on the torus and the sphere , as solved by herbert @xcite , majda and wang @xcite , describe the inverse energy cascade and agree with observation ( [ obs1 ] ) apart from this : mrs-2 permits all combinations of the lowest modes , but observation ( [ obs1 ] ) shows that only symmetric coherent states with equal numbers and magnitudes of positive and negative vortices appear .",
    "we show below that mrs-4 on the torus improves agreement with numerical simulation in this regard by partly lifting the degeneracy of mrs-2 .",
    "mrs-2 also conflicts with observation ( [ obs2 ] ) because the complete condensation of energy at the largest possible scales as described by mrs-2 manifests itself as a linear vorticity - streamfunction relationship , and the vortices do not have sharp cores .",
    "the higher fine - grained casimir constraints yield nonlinear vorticity - streamfunction relationships that are consistent with observations ( [ obs2 ] ) and ( [ obs3 ] ) .",
    "first - order perturbative mrs-4 on the square torus and the non - rotating sphere produces a vorticity - streamfunction relationship that is either @xmath30-like or @xmath31-like depending on the values of conserved quantities . using the values of the coarse - grained quantities at different times in a simulation , the @xmath30-like vorticity - streamfunction relationship , observation ( [ obs2 ] ) , is reproduced after a short initial period of filament development and before the perturbation assumption breaks down .",
    "perturbative imposition of the @xmath32 constraint at first order accounts for asymmetry between positive and negative vorticity that is approximately absent in the systems studied by numerical simulation here .    to summarize : mrs-2 describes a complete condensation of energy to the largest scales , whereas the imposition of the fine - grained quartic casimir constraint improves agreement with simulations by sharpening the cores and spreading spectral power into smaller - scale modes ; mrs-2 is independent of rotation , but descriptions that further conserve higher fine - grained casimirs are affected by rotation .",
    "non - conservative simulations with hyperviscosity yield the @xmath30-like vorticity - streamfunction relationship that agrees with mrs-4 , mrs @xcite and conservative simulations @xcite but disagrees with mrs-2 . in the absence of hyperviscosity , inviscid spectral simulation fails to conserve the third and higher resolved casimirs and yields instead the linear relationship of mrs-2 equilibria @xcite , in accord with the idea that hyperviscosity helps to restore the dynamical effects of the conservation laws lost in truncation .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "introduces the models and methods used in numerical simulation . compares mrs-2 against numerical simulation on the square torus and on the non - rotating sphere , showing that mrs-2 and numerical simulation yield qualitatively similar coherent structures but disagree on quantitative aspects such as the radial vorticity profiles .",

    "extends the comparison between mrs-2 and numerical simulation to rotating spheres where now qualitative discrepancies are found : mrs-2 does not depend on the rotation rate but late - time coherent structures are strongly affected by rotation .",
