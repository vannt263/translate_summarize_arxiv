    "microtubules ( mt ) are involved in key processes of cell functions such as mitosis , cell morphogenesis and motility .",
    "the building blocks of microtubules are @xmath0-tubulin heterodimers which can associate either laterally or longitudinally @xcite . in biological systems",
    ", microtubules display unusual non - equilibrium dynamic behaviors , which are relevant for cell functioning .",
    "one such behavior , termed treadmilling involves a flux of subunits from one polymer end to the other , and is created by a difference of critical concentrations of the two ends @xcite . in another behavior , termed dynamic instability , microtubules undergo alternating phases of elongation and rapid shortening @xcite .",
    "the two behaviors , treadmilling and dynamic instability result from an interplay between the polymerization and the gtp hydrolysis .",
    "the cap model provides a simple explanation for the dynamic instability : a growing microtubule is stabilized by a cap of unhydrolyzed units at its extremity , and when this cap is lost , the microtubule undergoes a sudden change to the shrinkage state , a so called catastrophe .",
    "the transitions between growth and shrinking can be described by a two state model with prescribed stochastic transitions @xcite .",
    "this model has lead to a number of theoretical and experimental studies @xcite , which have shown in particular the existence of a phase boundary between a bounded growth and an unbounded growth regimes .",
    "although many features of microtubules dynamics can be captured in this way , this model remains phenomenological , because of the unknown dependence of the transition rates as function of external factors , such as tubulin concentration or temperature .    to go beyond phenomenological models , one needs to account for the main chemical reactions occurring at the level of a single monomer @xcite .",
    "these reactions can be assumed to occur between discrete states , and the corresponding transition rates can be observed experimentally . in this way , discrete models can be constructed , which capture remarkably well the main dynamical features of single actin or single microtubule filaments @xcite .",
    "these discrete models have the additional advantage of being free from some of the limitations inherent to continuous models .",
    "the question of the precise mechanism of hydrolysis in microtubules or actin has been controversial for many years despite decades of experimental work . in the vectorial model",
    ", hydrolysis occurs only at the unique interface between units bound to gtp / atp and units bound to gdp / adp , while in the random model , hydrolysis can occur on any unhydrolyzed unit of the filament leading to a multiplicity of interfaces at a given time . between these two limits , models with an arbitrary level of cooperativity in the hydrolysis",
    "have been considered ( see for instance @xcite for actin and @xcite for microtubules ) .",
    "the idea that the filament dynamics depends on the mechanism of hydrolysis in its interior or more generally on the internal structure of the filament has been recently emphasized and it has been given the name of structural plasticity @xcite . as a practical recent illustration of that idea ,",
    "the dynamical properties of microtubules can be tuned by incorporating in them gdp - tubulin in a controlled way @xcite .    in microtubules ,",
    "many experimental facts point towards a mechanism of hydrolysis which is non - vectorial but random or cooperative .",
    "studies of the statistics of catastrophes @xcite already provided hints about this , but there are now more direct evidences .",
    "the observation of gtp - tubulin remnants inside a microtubule using a specific antibody @xcite is probably one of the most compelling evidences . with the development of microfluidic devices for biochemical applications",
    ", similar experiments probing the internal structure and the dynamics of single bio - filaments are becoming more and more accessible .",
    "furthermore , it is now possible to record the dynamics of microtubule plus - ends at nanometer resolution @xcite , thus allowing essentially to detect the addition and departure of single tubulin dimers from microtubule ends . in view of all these recent developments",
    ", there is a clear need to organize all this information on microtubules dynamics with a theoretical model . here",
    ", we propose a simple one dimensional non - equilibrium model , accounting for the hydrolysis occurring within the filament .",
    "we show that this model successfully explains for many known experimental observations with microtubules such as : the cap size , the dependence of the catastrophe time versus monomer concentration and the delay before a catastrophe following a dilution @xcite .",
    "our interpretation of this data confirms and goes beyond results obtained in a recent numerical and theoretical study of the dynamic instability of mt @xcite . in vivo ,",
    "the dynamics of microtubules is controlled by a variety of binding proteins , which typically modify the polymerization process . here",
    "we focus on the physical principles which control the dynamic instability of microtubules in vitro in the absence of any microtubule associated proteins .",
    "our model differs from previous attempts to address this problem , in that it is sufficiently simple to be analytically solvable to a large extend , while still capturing the main features of mt dynamics .",
    "gtp hydrolysis is a two steps process : the first step , the gtp cleavage produces gdp - pi and is rapid , while the second step , the release of the phosphate ( pi ) , leads to gdp - tubulin and is by comparison much slower .",
    "this suggests that many kinetic features of tubulin polymerization can be explained by a simplified model of hydrolysis , which takes into account only the second step of hydrolysis and treats tubulin subunits bound to gtp and tubulin subunits bound to gdp - pi as a single specie @xcite .",
    "this is the assumption which we make here .",
    "therefore what we mean by random hydrolysis here is the random process of phosphate release , which as we argue , controls the dynamic instability of microtubules .",
    "our second main assumption has to do with the neglect of the protofilament structure of microtubules .",
    "protofilaments are likely to be strongly interacting and should experience mechanical stresses in the mt lattice .",
    "we agree that modeling these effects is important to provide a complete microscopic picture of the transition from the growing phase to the shrinking phase , since this transition should involve protofilament curling near the mt ends @xcite . here , we do not account for such effects , because as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are interested in constructing a minimal dynamic model for microtubules , which would describe in a coarse - grained way the main aspects of the dynamics of this polymer .",

    "the plot of this velocity versus concentration exhibits a kink shape near the critical concentration , which is not particularly sensitive to the mechanism of hydrolysis since it is present both in the vectorial and random model @xcite .",

    "[ recursion ] , it follows that @xmath33 , and therefore , the steady - state probability that the cap has exactly a length @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is @xmath36 .",
    "this leads to the following expression : p_l = b^l(l-1)/2 q^l ( 1 - b^l q ) , [ ss proba ] and , the corresponding average cap size is : l = _",
    "l 1 l p_l = _ l 1 b^l(l-1)/2 q^l .    in figure [ fig - cap ] , we show how this average cap size varies as function of the free tubulin concentration . the average cap becomes longer than approximatively one subunit above the critical concentration , @xmath29 defined above , and which is about 7@xmath9 m for the parameters of table [ table - rates ] used here . at concentrations significantly larger than this value , the cap grows more slowly , as @xmath37 as @xmath38 @xcite . in the range of concentration [ 0:100 @xmath9 m ] , the cap stays smaller than about 47 subunits , which represents only 3.6 layers ( or 28 nm ) .",
    "this estimate indicates that the cap is below optical resolution in the range of tubulin concentration generally used , which could explain the difficulty for observing it experimentally .     in @xmath9 m .",
    "the line is the mean - field analytical solution and the filled squares are simulation points .",
    "[ fig - cap ] ]    a long standing view in the literature is that the cap could be as small as a single layer , as shown by experiments based on a chemical detection of the phosphate release @xcite .",
    "this view has been recently challenged by two experiments , in which the length fluctuations of microtubules were probed at the nanoscale , @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these experiments still generate debates @xcite . in any case ,",
    "taken together these two experimental studies reported a highly variable mt plus - end growth behavior , which suggests that the cap size is a fluctuating quantity , larger than one layer but smaller than about 5 layers .",
    "we note that such a range is compatible with our prediction and agrees with the estimation obtained from dilution experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our stochastic model naturally incorporates a fluctuating cap size . even if the cap is indeed below optical resolution",
    ", we note that this does not rule out the possibility that it could be observed with the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in figure [ fig - cap ]",
    ", we also compare the predictions of the mean - field approximation with an exact simulation of the dynamics .",
    "we find that mean - field theory provides an excellent approximation of the exact solution when the free tubulin concentration is above the critical concentration , which corresponds to the conditions of most experiments @xcite .",
    "deviations can be seen between the exact solution and its mean - field approximation in figure [ fig - cap ] but only below the critical concentration .",
    "many other quantities of interest follow from the determination of the nucleotide content of a given subunit , namely @xmath23 , such as the length fluctuations of the filament @xcite or the islands distribution of hydrolyzed or non - hydrolyzed subunits @xcite .",
    "these predictions should prove particularly useful in testing this model against experiments , since the island distribution of unhydrolyzed units or `` remnants '' will become accessible in future experiments similar to that of @xcite but carried out in in vitro conditions .",
    "one difficulty in bridging the gap between a model of the dynamic instability and experiments , lies in a proper definition of the event which is called a catastrophe , since the number of reported catastrophes is affected by several factors depending on the experimental conditions , such as for instance the experimental resolution of the observation @xcite .",
    "although a catastrophe manifests itself experimentally as an abrupt reduction of the total filament length , we choose to define it from the nucleotide content of the terminal region .",
    "following closely ref .",
    "@xcite , we define a shrinking configuration as one in which the last @xmath7 units of the filament are all in the gdp state ( irrespective of the state of the other units ) as shown in figure [ fig - sketch ] . the remaining configurations ( with an unhydrolyzed cap of any size or when the number of hydrolyzed subunits at the end is less than @xmath7 ) are assumed to belong to the growing phase .",
    "in such a two states description of the dynamics ( with a growing and a shrinking phase ) , which is implicitly assumed in the analysis of most experiments , the catastrophe frequency @xmath39 is the inverse of the average time spent in the growing phase , while the rescue frequency @xmath40 is the inverse of the average time spent in the shrinking phase .",
    "it follows from this that the catastrophe frequency @xmath39 can be obtained as the probability flux out of the growing state divided by the probability to be in the growing state .",
    "for instance for @xmath41 , this flux condition is [ catastrophe frequencyn=1 ] f_c(1 ) q = ( w_t+r ) p_1 + r _ j 2 p_j , where the terms on the right proportional to @xmath42 correspond to a transition of the terminal unit from the gtp to the gdp state , which can occur either through hydrolysis or depolymerization of that unit , while the last term corresponds to hydrolysis of the terminal unit from cap states of length larger or equal than 2 .",
    "we have derived the general expression of @xmath39 in the case of an arbitrary @xmath7 as shown in supporting information ( si ) methods , and we have checked these results by comparing them with stochastic simulations using the gillespie algorithm @xcite .    in the case of the vectorial model , the last term in eq .",
    "[ catastrophe frequencyn=1 ] is absent and the catastrophe frequency is non - zero only below the critical concentration . the fact that catastrophes are observed in @xcite significantly above the critical concentration indicates that this data is incompatible with a vectorial mechanism .",
    "for this reason , we only discuss here the predictions of the random model .",
    "the catastrophe time @xmath43 is shown as function of growth velocity for @xmath44 in figure [ fig - n]a , and as a function of the concentration of free subunits , @xmath32 , for @xmath41 in figure [ fig - n]b . the growth velocity is simply proportional to the concentration of free subunits .",
    "for both plots , one sees that below the critical concentration which is in the range of 5 - 10 @xmath9 m , the catastrophe time is zero as expected since there is no stable filament in that region of concentration .",
    "note that @xmath45 behaves linearly as function of @xmath32 for @xmath44 but it behaves non - linearly for @xmath41 .",
    "since the experimental data of @xcite shows a linear dependence , this comparison indicates that the data can be explained with the model for @xmath44 but not for @xmath41 .",
    "the same observation has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same data has been analyzed .",
    "note however , in comparing this work with this reference the following differences : first , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite neglects rescues and assumes that the duration of a catastrophe once started is zero while the present model includes rescues , and takes into account the finite rate of loss of gdp units .",
    "secondly the results of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the regime of high concentration of free subunits while the present model holds at any concentration even in the proximity or below the critical concentration .",
    "thirdly the present approach leads to analytical results with the assumption that the filament has no protofilament structure while the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are numerical but that model includes a protofilament structure .",
    "our analytical derivation of the catastrophe time confirms that the case @xmath41 differs in an essential way from the @xmath46 case at high concentration .",
    "indeed , the catastrophe time reaches a plateau when the concentration goes to infinity for @xmath41 , while it goes to infinity for @xmath46 .",
    "this trend is already apparent in the figure [ fig - n ] .    in figure [ fig - n ] , we have used a value for the rate of hydrolysis @xmath47 , which is higher than that estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( there the estimate was 0.002 ) .",
    "the reason is that the hydrolysis rate is a global factor which controls the amplitude of the catastrophe time , basically @xmath45 scales for an arbitrary @xmath7 as @xmath48 .",
    "the value @xmath49 leads to a reasonable estimate for @xmath45 for @xmath41 ( albeit with the wrong dependence on concentration ) , but if we take seriously as we do here , the observation that only the definition with @xmath44 is compatible with the measured concentration dependence of the catastrophe time , then @xmath4 must have a significantly larger value than expected , and @xmath50 is the value that is needed for @xmath51 in order to match the experimental data .",
    "finally , we also note that the scaling of @xmath45 as a power law of @xmath4 means that large values of @xmath7 ( such as @xmath52 ) can be excluded given the observed range of catastrophe times .",
    "we also show the distribution of catastrophe times calculated with the parameters given in table [ table - rates ] , for @xmath41 and @xmath44 in figure [ fig : distrib - catastrophe2 ] .",
    "these distributions in both cases are essentially exponential ( except at a very short time which is probably inaccessible in practice in the experiments ) , in agreement with the observations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite with free filaments .",
    "( filled squares ) and @xmath53(open circles ) .",
    "( right ) the distribution of catastrophe time ( n=2 ) for different concentration values @xmath54(filled squares ) and @xmath53(open circles ) .",
    "the distributions are normalized .",
    "[ fig : distrib - catastrophe2 ] ]    one advantage of our microscopic model is that it can explain and predict different related aspects of the dynamic instability of microtubules .",
    "specifically , it also allows to predict the statistics of rescue events when the polymer switches from the shrinking phase back into the growing phase . assuming that the system reached a steady - state behavior , the frequency of rescues @xmath55 can be calculated using flux conditions similar to the ones used to obtain @xmath39 ( see si methods for more details ) .",
    "the corresponding expression is rather simple and it can be written as [ fr ] f_r(n)=u+w_d b^n q. we have carried out a complete numerical test of this frequency of rescues using stochastic simulations , which is shown in si fig .  1 .",
    "our model predicts that rescue events should be observable under typical cellular conditions and in experiments .",
    "however , surprisingly there is a very limited experimental information on rescues .",
    "the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) might shed some light on this issue . at low concentrations of gtp monomers in the solution",
    ", when the rate @xmath1 is small , the average time before the rescue event , @xmath56 , might be very large . as a result",
    ", it might not be observable in experiments since the polymer with @xmath57 monomers could collapse faster ( @xmath58 ) before any rescue event could take place . at large @xmath1 , rescues are more frequent given that the polymer is in the shrinking state .",
    "but the frequency of the catastrophes is very small under these conditions , the microtubule is almost always in the growing phase .",
    "therefore in these conditions , rescues are not observed @xcite .      in dilution experiments ,",
    "the concentration of free tubulin is abruptly reduced to a small value , resulting in catastrophes within seconds , independent of the initial concentration @xcite .",
    "this observation is an evidence that the cap is short and independent of the initial concentration .",
    "the idea that the cap is short is also supported by the observation that cutting the end of a microtubule typically with a laser results in catastrophe . as we shall see below",
    ", all these well - known experimental facts about microtubules can be explained by the present model .    here , we are interested in the time until the first catastrophe appears following the dilution . for simplicity , we take the definition of catastrophe introduced in the previous section for @xmath41 , which means that a catastrophe starts as soon as the cap has disappeared ( as shown in the previous section",
    ", one could extend this result to the more general case of an arbitrary @xmath7 ) .",
    "let us then introduce @xmath59 the distribution of the first passage time @xmath60 for an initial condition corresponding to a cap of length @xmath61 , and a filament in contact with a medium of arbitrary concentration . as explained in si methods , it is possible to calculate analytically @xmath59 , by a method recently used in the context of polymer translocation @xcite . after numerically inverting the laplace transform of @xmath59 ,",
    "one obtains the distribution @xmath59 which is shown as solid lines in figure [ fig : dfpt ] for the particular case of @xmath62 . as can be seen in this figure",
    ", the predicted distributions agree very well with the results obtained from the stochastic simulation in this case .    from the distribution @xmath59",
    "we obtain its first moment , the mean first passage time of the cap @xmath63 . as shown in si methods , we find that t(k ) = _",
    "j=0^k-1 y^j , [ full tk ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the functions @xmath67 are bessel functions .",
    "the dependance of @xmath63 as a function of the initial size of the cap @xmath61 is shown in figure [ fig : tk ] : at small @xmath61 , @xmath63 is essentially linear in @xmath61 as would be expected at all @xmath61 in the vectorial model of hydrolysis @xcite , while here it saturates at large values of @xmath61 ( the value of this plateau can be calculated analytically but only for @xmath68 see si methods ) . to understand this saturation , consider a cap which is initially infinitively large , then after a time of order @xmath69 , the cap abruptly becomes of a finite much smaller size as a result of the hydrolysis of one unit at a random position within the filament .",
    "this feature will always happen irrespective of the monomer concentration , and indeed in figure [ fig : tk ] , @xmath63 has a plateau for @xmath70 for all values of the monomer concentration .",
    "we note that such a behavior of @xmath63 as function of @xmath61 has similarities with the case of non - compact exploration investigated in @xcite , while the vectorial model of hydrolysis would correspond in the language of this reference to the case of compact exploration .",
    "let us now turn to a practical use of this quantity for characterizing the dynamic instability .",
    "in the previous section , we calculated the catastrophe time @xmath51 .",
    "we expect that this quantity is an average of @xmath63 , and indeed we find for the case of @xmath41 that @xmath51 is bounded by @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( the choice of @xmath73 is purely illustrative ) as shown in figure [ fig - n ] .",
    "the characteristic time observed in dilution experiments is another average of @xmath63 .",
    "more precisely , let us denote @xmath74 as the first passage time in post - dilution conditions given that the initial length of the cap is @xmath61 .",
    "the dilution time @xmath75 is then the average of @xmath74 with respect to the steady - state probability distribution of the initial conditions before the dilution occurs . in other words ,",
    "t_dilution=_k t(k ) _ post p_k(predilution ) , [ dilution ] where @xmath76 is the stationary probability given in eq .",
    "[ ss proba ] in pre - dilution conditions .    in the case",
    "that the final medium after dilution is very dilute , one can assume that the final free tubulin concentration is zero , which allows to simplify the general expression given in eq .",
    "[ full tk ] as explained in si methods .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ dilution ] , one obtains the dilution time for the parameters of the table [ table - rates ] which is shown in figure [ fig - dilution ] .",

    "solid line is the mean - field prediction based on eq .",
    "[ dilution ] and the symbols are simulation points . as found experimentally , the dilution time is essentially independent of the concentration of tubulin in the pre - dilution state , and the time to observe the first catastrophe is of the order of seconds or less .",
    "[ fig - dilution ] ]    the figure confirms that the dilution time can be as short as a fraction of seconds in this case .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this calculation to the case of an arbitrary value of the post - dilution medium ( _ i.e _ for the case of a dilution of arbitrary strength ) using the general expression derived in eq .",
    "[ full tk ] .",
    "as the amplitude of the dilution is reduced ( by increasing the post - dilution concentration ) , the dilution time increases as well but the general sigmoidal shape remains , with in particular a plateau at concentrations above the critical concentration .",
    "the presence of these plateaux means that the dilution time is essentially independent of the concentration of the monomers in pre - dilutions conditions as observed experimentally .",
    "note that the height of these plateaux scale with the hydrolysis rate .",
    "for instance , to explain the dilution times reported in @xcite , one needs to use a smaller value of @xmath4 as given in the table because of the use of the @xmath41 definition of catastrophe . alternatively , just as in the calculation of the catastrophe frequencies , it is possible to keep the expected large value of @xmath4 provided the @xmath44 definition of catastrophe is chosen .",
    "thus , complementary information can be obtained from the catastrophe frequencies and the dilution times .",
    "in this work , we have explained several important features about microtubules dynamics using a model for the random release of phosphate within the filament .",
    "the results of our mean - field approach are analytical to a large extend . with this approach",
    "we could recover some well known features of mt dynamics such as the mean catastrophe time and its distribution or the delays following a dilution , but we have also investigated much less studied aspects concerning the cap size , the role of the definition of catastrophes ( via the parameter @xmath7 ) and the first passage time of the cap .",
    "the theoretical model and ideas presented in this paper for the case of microtubules could also apply to other biofilaments such as actin or par - m , for which the random hydrolysis model may be relevant as well .",
    "furthermore , although the model describes a priori only single free filaments dynamics , it is also potentially useful for understanding constrained filaments , in the broader context of force generation and force regulation by ensembles of biofilaments . for this reason",
    ", it would be interesting to study extensions of the model to account for the various effects of maps on microtubules , which should shed light on the behavior of microtubules in more realistic biological conditions .",
