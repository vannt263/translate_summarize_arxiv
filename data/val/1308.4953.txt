    "the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse , with a variety of matter fields , has been well studied in general relativity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "those investigations indicate that the gravitational collapse , depending on the initial conditions , may produce a black hole with a singularity inside or a naked singularity as its final state @xcite . however , these results are not expected to hold in a quantum theory of gravity . among the candidates for a theory of quantum gravity , loop quantum gravity ( lqg )",
    "@xcite is a non - perturbative background independent theory . from the effective constraints",
    "approach used in the lqg program , there are two general types of quantum corrections , namely the ` inverse triad ' and ` holonomy ' types .",
    "the study of the gravitational collapse has thus been considered in lqg , by means of these corrections .",
    "it was proposed that inverse triad modifications resolve the classical singularities that arise at the final state of the gravitational collapse , whose matter source is a standard scalar field @xcite . moreover , in a homogeneous and spherically symmetric model , loop gravity effects , within a holonomy correction , modify the standard friedmann equation by adding a @xmath2 correction term into it . in a cosmological context , these effects resolve the big bang singularity and replace it by a bounce @xcite .",
    "in addition , for gravitational collapse of a scalar field @xcite , with non - interacting particles ( dust ) and a perfect fluid describing radiation @xcite , it was shown that those quantum gravity effects provide a threshold scale for a non - singular black hole formation .",
    "more recently , the gravitational collapse of a self interacting tachyon field coupled with a barotropic fluid has been considered in a classical context @xcite , exploring the non - canonical features of the tachyon kinetic term and its subsequent ( anti)friction effects .",
    "therein , a dynamical system analysis was employed , where , by making use of the specific kinematical features of the tachyon field ( which are rather different from a standard scalar field ) , it was established the initial conditions for which either the tachyon or the fluid becomes dominant . it was found the conditions under which a black hole or a naked singularity scenarios are produced , as well as solutions with a tracking behaviour between the tachyon and the fluid .",
    "a tachyon scalar field has also been investigated in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) as a concrete example for investigating the initial singularity of the universe @xcite . in the context of a gravitational collapse , by employing quantum gravity effects of the inverse triad type",
    ", it was proposed that the geometry of space - time near the classical singularity is regular @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some novel features such as evaporation of the horizons in the presence of the inverse triad modifications were studied .",
    "nevertheless , holonomy type correction can bring , in the context of homogeneous lqc , distinct and interesting physical aspects when compared with the inverse triad type .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to investigate how a modification provided by holonomy corrections to the tachyon equations of motion can avoid the classical singularity that may arise at the final state of the gravitational collapse .",
    "in addition , another question that can be addressed here is how this type of loop quantum effect can indeed affect the emergence of trapped surfaces in this kind of models .",
    "these questions constitute our main goal to be explored in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ collapse-1 ]",
    "we employ the loop gravity effects with holonomy corrections to the gravitational collapse of a tachyon field in addition with a barotropic fluid .",
    "then , in section [ collapse - dynamics ] we present a phase space analysis for our semiclassical model and will find the possible fixed point solutions to the evolution equations .",
    "this analysis provides a correspondence between the fixed point solutions found in the herein semiclassical regime and those given by their general relativistic counterpart presented in ref .",
    "nevertheless , it will be shown that the corresponding loop gravity modified fixed point solutions , due to the holonomy effects , are free of the central singularity whereas their classical counterpart are not . in section [ collapse - end ] , by using numerical techniques , we will study the evolution of trapped surfaces in the semiclassical interior space - time of the collapse .",
    "this analysis will further provide a contrasting between our herein semiclassical analysis and the one given by the inverse triad modified collapsing scenario presented in ref .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we present the conclusion and discussion of our work .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse whose interior space - time is the marginally bound case , i.e. , the @xmath3 flrw @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be the proper time for a falling observer whose geodesic trajectories are labeled by the comoving radial coordinate @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the area radius of the collapsing cloud .",
    "then , for a continuous collapsing scenario , we take @xmath7 ( with a ` dot ' denoting a derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath4 ) , implying that the area radius of the collapsing shell , for a constant @xmath5 , decreases monotonically .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian constraint for the interior geometry is provided as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the conjugate connection and triad satisfying the non - vanishing poisson bracket @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the barbero - immirzi dimensionless parameter .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the matter hamiltonian with @xmath15 being the volume of the fiducial cell @xcite .",
    "a pertinent scenario to investigate semiclassically effects suggested from lqg ( as far as a gravitational collapse is concerned ) is the so - called _",
    "holonomy correction_. the algebra generated by the holonomy of phase space variables @xmath16 is just the algebra of the almost periodic function of @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is inferred as kinematical length of the square loop , since its dimension is similar to that of a length , which together with @xmath19 , constitutes the fundamental canonical variables in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "this consists semiclassically in replacing @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ hamil - gr ] ) , with the phase space function , by means of @xmath20 it is expected that the classical theory is recovered for small @xmath18 ; we therefore obtain the effective semiclassical hamiltonian @xcite @xmath21 the dynamics of the fundamental variables is then obtained by solving the system of hamilton equations ; i.e. , @xmath22 furthermore , the vanishing hamiltonian constraint ( [ effham-1 ] ) implies that @xmath23 thus , using eqs .",
    "( [ hameqs-1 ] ) and ( [ hamilton - eq2 ] ) , we subsequently obtain the modified friedmann equation , @xmath24  : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the total ( classical ) energy density of the collapse matter content . eq .",
    "( [ friedmann - eff-1a ] ) implies that the classical energy density @xmath27 is limited to the interval @xmath28 having an upper bound at @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the energy density of the star at the initial configuration , @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the effective energy density reads @xmath32 we see that the effective scenario , provided by holonomy corrections , leads to a @xmath33 modification of the energy density , which becomes important when the energy density becomes comparable to @xmath29 . in the limit @xmath34 ,",
    "the hubble rate vanishes ; a classical singularity is thus replaced by a bounce .    from eq .",
    "( [ friedmann - eff-1a ] ) the time derivative of the hubble rate reads @xmath35 then , using the relation @xmath36 we obtain the modified raychaudhuri equation as @xmath37 by redefinition of the raychaudhuri equation ( [ ray-1 ] ) , similar to the corresponding classical relation , in an effective form @xmath38 , we obtain the effective pressure @xmath39 of the system as @xcite @xmath40 the effective energy density @xmath41 and pressure @xmath42 satisfy the conservation equation : @xmath43 we can define the effective equation of state as @xmath44    in general relativity , the equation for an apparent horizon in a spherical symmetric space - time is given by @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 ; the @xmath47 is the mass function of the collapsing matter .",
    "thus , the space - time is said to be trapped or untrapped if @xmath48 or @xmath49 , respectively @xcite . since in the considered effective scenario , the energy density @xmath27 in the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann - eff-1a ] )",
    "is modified as @xmath41 , hence , the mass function @xmath50 should be modified in the herein semiclassical regime and can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath51 we followed a possible perspective in effective scenario in which , the phase space trajectories are considered to have classical form whereas the matter components take effective form due to quantum effects . the @xmath52 term in eq .",
    "( [ massf - eff ] ) can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively , values of the scale factor and mass function at the bounce .",

    "furthermore , the effective mass function ( [ massf - eff ] ) vanishes at the bounce .",
    "we should notice that the effective mass function ( [ massf - eff ] ) , likewise the effective energy density and pressure , must be consistent with the continuity equation ( [ cons - eff ] ) . by working out the relations ( [ massf - eff ] ) , ( [ newfriedmann ] ) and ( [ peff ] ) , using the conservation equation ( [ cons - eff ] ) , we find the following effective equations describing the dynamics of our semiclassical gravitational collapse : @xmath59 with ` @xmath60 ' denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath5 . in the classical limit where @xmath61 , we have that @xmath62 ;   @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then , eq .

    "furthermore , the energy density of the barotropic fluid , @xmath70 , reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a positive constant denoting the fluid density at the initial configuration , @xmath73 , of the collapse , and @xmath0 is an adiabatic index satisfying @xmath74 , with @xmath75 being the pressure of the barotropic fluid .    for a physically reasonable matter",
    "content for the collapsing cloud , the tachyon field and the barotropic fluid would have to satisfy the weak and dominant energy conditions .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the tachyon matter satisfies the weak and dominant energy conditions . for a fluid with the barotropic parameter @xmath76 ,",
    "the weak energy condition is satisfied , however , concerning the dominant energy condition , it follows that @xmath0 must hold the range @xmath77 @xcite .    from the total energy conservation equation for collapse matter source ,",
    "we could write , generally , that @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 denotes the interaction between the tachyon and fluid . a natural interpretation of @xmath79 is that it implies an energy transfer between the tachyon field and the barotropic fluid .",
    "such cases were studied in ( classical ) cosmological scenarios where two fluid system drive an accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to investigate the effects of lqg holonomy corrections to the tachyon equations of motion , and consequently , the emergence of trapped surfaces in the herein semiclassical collapse .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss the situation in which only a tachyon matter or a fluid is present .",
    "thus , our approach will be to consider the non - interacting case to fully access the underlying dynamics .",
    "however , it is expected that for the interacting case the main features of the bouncing scenario will remain unchanged .",
    "but , allowing a situation where the tachyon field and the barotropic fluid no longer obey a local conservation equation , might certainly change the outcome of the horizon formation in the presence of the interaction term .",
    "when we find the solutions for the non - interacting case , we may get a general idea of how the presence of the interaction term can affect our outcome , however , a full independent analysis will be required to describe the dynamics of the collapse in the case of interacting tachyon matter . in the present context , we thus only assume that the tachyon field is self interacting , i.e. , @xmath80 . the conservation energy density ( [ lconserv2 ] ) for the tachyon field gives @xmath81,\\label{field - eq-1}\\ ] ] where ` @xmath82 ' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath83 .",

    "it is also expected that , since @xmath221 is a monotonically decreasing function near the bounce , eq .",
    "( [ theta2-q2-x ] ) is essentially described as a second order polynomial .",
    "therefore , depending on the initial conditions , in particular on the choice of the @xmath205 , three cases can be evaluated , which correspond to _ no _ apparent horizon formation ( @xmath223 ) , one and two horizons formation ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "let us introduce a radius @xmath225 , defined by @xmath226 we see that @xmath225 determines a _ threshold radius _ for the horizon formation ; if @xmath227 , then no horizon can form at any stage of the collapse .",
    "the case @xmath228 corresponds to the formation of a dynamical horizon at the boundary of the two space - time regions @xcite . finally , for the case @xmath229 two horizons will form , one inside and the other outside of the collapsing matter .",
    "the behaviour of the three possible scenarios ( tracking solution , tachyon and fluid dominated solutions ) are also represented in figure [ f - speed-1 ] .",
    "we note that only one horizon forms for some particular tachyon dominated solutions .",
    "therefore , for these solutions the bounce will be covered by an horizon . in order to further clarify this aspect",
    ", we note that when more than one horizon forms , the speed of the collapse @xmath230 must have a local maximum . in that case , the acceleration must be @xmath231 , and from equations ( [ friedmann - eff-1a])([lfriedmann2 ] ) we can determine that this local maximum can be found by imposing @xmath232 this last condition , being equivalent to @xmath233 , must be closely monitored for the three different solutions discussed in this section . for the fluid dominated solution , and since the effective pressure starts from positive values and evolve to negatives one near the bounce , it is straightforward to verify that the function @xmath234 must intersect @xmath235 at some point before reaching the bounce . for the tracking solution we can use the same argument but with an initial effective pressure starting near zero and reaching @xmath236 at the bounce . finally , the case of the tachyon dominated solution depends on the value of the barotropic parameter @xmath0 . when the initial values for the effective pressure and energy densities are @xmath237 and @xmath238 , respectively ; then , if @xmath239 , the argument given for the tracking and fluid dominated solution is also valid for this case . however , if @xmath240 , there will be at the most one horizon forming .",
    "besides taking @xmath239 , if we consider an unbalanced initial energy density , with the tachyon being slightly dominant , i.e. , @xmath241 , a local maximum for @xmath230 will also be present .      finally , the discussion of the final outcomes related to the semiclassical solutions follows the one made in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this previous work",
    ", it is described that the fate of the collapsing star ( with a massless scalar field as matter source ) whose shell radius is less than the threshold radius @xmath225 points to the existence of an energy flux radiated away from the interior space - time and reaching the distant observer . in the present study , for a collapsing system",
    "whose initial boundary radius @xmath205 is less than @xmath225 , we analyze the resulting mass loss due to the semiclassical modified interior geometry .",
    "in particular , this analysis is only carried for the tracking solution or fluid dominated scenario , since the tachyon dominated solution develops no more than one horizon , for @xmath240 and @xmath242 , before reaching the bounce .",
    "let us designate the initial mass function at scales @xmath108 , i.e , in the classical regime , as @xmath243 , with @xmath244 . for @xmath245 ( in the semiclassical regime )",
    "we have , instead , an effective mass function @xmath246 given by eq .",
    "( [ massf - eff ] ) .",
    "then , the ( quantum geometrical ) mass loss , @xmath247 ( where @xmath248 ) , for any shell , is provided by the following expression : @xmath249 as @xmath27 increases the mass loss decreases positively until it vanishes at a point .",
    "then , @xmath250 continues decreasing ( negatively ) until it reaches to a minimum at @xmath251 . henceforth , in the energy interval @xmath252 , the mass loss increases until the bouncing point at @xmath183 , where @xmath253 ; this means that the quantum gravity corrections , applied to the interior region , give rise to an outward flux of energy near the bounce in the semiclassical regime .",
    "the previously described behaviour for the mass loss will be qualitatively identical with respect to the solution considered . therefore the tachyon",
    "( when @xmath239 or the initial energy densities are @xmath254 ) , fluid dominated or tracking solutions will exhibit the same profile for the mass loss .",
    "the only difference between these three cases , shown in the right plot of figure [ bound - f(r ) ] , is the value of the radius where the mass loss reaches the maximum @xmath253 . in the last section we discussed the fact that the bounce occurring in the tachyon dominated solution is delayed compared with the other solutions .",
    "consequently , the bounce ( where @xmath253 ) take place for a smaller value of the radius @xmath255 .        in the other case , where @xmath256 , in which one or two horizon form , the exterior geometry can be obtained by matching the interior to a generalized vaidya exterior geometry at the boundary @xmath205 of the cloud . following the method provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can write the exterior metric in advanced null coordinates @xmath257 as @xmath258 where the exterior function is given by @xmath259 . by applying the matching conditions at the boundary @xmath205 we have that @xmath260 where we have defined @xmath261 is the mass within the volume @xmath262 . for a fluid dominated solution we have @xmath263 in the limit case @xmath1 , i.e. the tracking solution , eq .",
    "( [ mass-2 ] ) reduces to @xmath264 which presents a modified oppenheimer - snyder collapse @xcite of homogeneous dust matter .",
    "figure [ bound - f(r ) ] shows the numerical behaviour of the boundary function @xmath265 in the classical ( dashed curve ) and semiclassical regime ( solid curves ) for the cases of the initial radius @xmath227 and @xmath256 .",
    "the later shows the behaviour of an exotic non - singular black hole geometry which is different from its classical counterpart .",
    "similarly , for a tachyon dominated case with @xmath189 ( or a purely tachyonic collapse ) , the mass @xmath266 reads @xmath267 it should be noticed that the energy density @xmath66 is upper bounded by the critical density @xmath192 , thus , the mass @xmath268 is always finite .",
    "in this paper we employed an effective scenario imported from lqg , namely the `` holonomy '' corrections to the dynamics of the gravitational collapse whose matter content involves a self interacting tachyon field and a barotropic fluid .",
    "our aim was to enlarge the discussion on tachyon field gravitational collapse . more concretely , on the one hand , extending the scope analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by investigating how the quantum gravity correction term @xmath2 , can alter the fate of the collapse . using a dynamical system analysis",
    ", we subsequently found a class of solutions .",
    "our semiclassical analysis showed that , the corresponding stable fixed point ( attractor ) solutions in the classical general relativistic collapse become saddle points in our semiclassical collapse ; hence , the classical black hole and naked singularities produced in ref .",
    "@xcite are no longer present within the loop semiclassical regime studied in this paper .",
    "we found conditions to define a tachyon or fluid dominated regimes close to the bounce , depending on the value of the barotropic parameter of the fluid .",
    "the transition from one regime to the other shows the emergence of a tracking solution where the collapsing matter behaves as dust .",
    "it was also observed that , in scenarios with similar initial conditions , a fluid dominated solution drives the energy density of the collapsing cloud until the critical value @xmath192 more rapidly than a tachyon dominated solution .",
    "our analysis provides elements to contrast the correction features of holonomy to those given by inverse triad modification @xcite , as far as tachyon scalar field gravitational collapse is concerned .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of inverse triad effects is quite subtle in lqc ; it has been shown that for space - times with non - compact topology they can not be consistently incorporated .",
    "( we suggest the reader to see refs .",
    "@xcite where further technical details on the problem with inverse scale factor effects is discussed . ) in addition , it is important to mention that for space - times with spatial curvature there is no problem in including inverse scale factor effects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the aforementioned case of a gravitational collapse modified by inverse triad corrections",
    ", the energy density of collapsing matter source is a decreasing function of time towards the star center and remains constant there @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of the holonomy corrections , the quadratic density modifications provide an upper limit @xmath29 for the energy density @xmath27 of the collapsing matter , indicating that the herein semiclassical collapse leads to a non - singular bounce at the critical density @xmath269 .",
    "the mass loss obtained by the inverse triad scenario @xcite , was characterised by the reduction of energy density and mass function towards the star center , which leads to an outward energy flux .",
    "however , in the present semiclassical model , for a particular range of the radius of the boundary shell ( i.e. , @xmath227 ) , the energy density and the mass function growth of the collapsing cloud is followed by the effective mass loss reduction near the bounce , which subsequently gives rise to an outward energy flux at the collapse end state .",
    "in addition , a detailed dynamical system analysis in the inverse triad scenario predicted only one stable solution which allowed a barotropic fluid with a parameter satisfying the range @xmath270 ( where the superior limit is a consequence of the energy conditions imposed in the classical setting , discussed in ref .",
    "in contrast to the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the barotropic fluid parameter is less constrained and solutions with @xmath271 , as predicted by the classical model , are allowed to evolve until the bounce .",
    "we further investigated , by means of numerical studies , the evolution of trapped surfaces during the collapse in order to determine its final state .",
    "we found a threshold radius for the collapsing matter cloud in order to form a black hole at late time stages .",
    "the physical modifications related to the semiclassical regime provided three cases for the trapped surfaces formation , depending on the initial conditions of the collapsing star . in particular",
    ", our solutions showed that , if the initial boundary radius of the collapsing cloud is less than a threshold radius , namely @xmath225 , _ no _ horizon forms during the collapse , whereas for the radius equal and larger than the @xmath225 , one and two horizons form , respectively .",
    "it is worthy to mention that , for the tachyon dominated solutions , the previous scenario only happens when the barotropic parameter is @xmath239 or the initial energy densities satisfy @xmath241 .",
    "when @xmath240 and @xmath272 , not more than one apparent horizon forms .",
    "our effective scenario , in the presence of a tachyon field joined to a barotropic fluid , share a few common features to the one where , instead , a homogeneous massless scalar field was considered for the collapsing matter content @xcite . in both contexts , and in the particular case in which no horizon forms , it is shown that , as the collapse evolves , the energy density increases towards a maximum value @xmath273 at the bounce .",
    "moreover , in these semiclassical scenarios , the effective energy density reduction leads to a positive mass loss near the bounce .",
    "this results in a positive luminosity near the bounce which gives rise to an outward energy flux from the interior region , that may reach to a distant observer .",
    "in addition , in the cases in which one or two horizons form , the resulting exterior geometry corresponds to exotic non - singular black holes which are different from the schwarzschild one ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for such a black hole formation ) .    in our collapsing system",
    ", additional physical situations might arise from the interplay between the tachyon and the barotropic fluid .",
    "namely , the distinct matter dominance regimes yield a wider variety of outcomes , either for the horizon formation , or when the efficiency to reach the semiclassical bounce is concerned . including an interaction term @xmath79 , that could account for a transfer of energy between the tachyon field and the barotropic fluid ,",
    "is expected to change the results presented here .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to anticipate that the conditions required to define the fluid or tachyon dominated regimes will certainly be less simple .",
    "the emergence of these regimes will certainly reflect more than just the variation of the barotropic parameter . another interesting question to be addressed , in this context ,",
    "is related to the existence of a tracking behaviour and under which conditions it becomes possible .",
    "in fact , from the results presented here , the emergence of a tracking behaviour seems to occur at the transition between the fluid and the tachyon dominated regimes .",
    "would this situation be maintained in the interacting case ? the answers to these questions will also have an impact on the discussion about the horizon formation , since it is closely related to the matter dominance present at the bounce .",
    "therefore , one interesting extension to this work will be to consider an interaction between the tachyon and the barotropic fluid .",
    "the qualitative picture depicted from our toy model is strongly dependent on the choice of a homogeneous interior space - time .",
    "nevertheless , in a realistic collapsing scenario one should employ a more general inhomogeneous setting ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , where a detailed introduction to recent techniques to handle inhomogeneous systems provides the ingredients on how to extend the limited homogeneous case ) .",
    "when we apply homogeneous techniques , the quantum effects are restricted to the interior space - time , whereas , the outer space - time region is assumed to be a generalised vaidya metric defined by classical general relativity .",
    "some imprint of the interior quantum effects are transported to the outside , by imposing suitable matching conditions at the boundary surface , where it enters the vaidya solution effectively through a nonstandard energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this procedure is also restricted by the fact that a full inhomogeneous quantization , also covering the exterior region , is expected to provide significant modifications to the space - time structure .",
    "however , some indications on how the matter content might affect the bounce scenario may still be valid in a more general inhomogeneous setting .",
