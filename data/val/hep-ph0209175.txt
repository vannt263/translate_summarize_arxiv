    "the ever stronger experimental evidence for neutrino oscillation@xcite shows clearly that lepton flavor is not conserved in nature .",
    "if we accommodate this feature simply by an introduction of neutrino masses in the sm , other lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath3 would still have so small a rate ( a branching ratio @xmath4 ) that there is no hope for their detection in the foreseeable future .",
    "this is the case whether we have dirac neutrino masses with their small values inserted by hand , or the neutrinos are majorana particles with the smallness of their masses coming out of the seesaw mechanism . in the small dirac mass scenario ,",

    "neutrino states are present in the usual left - handed flavor eigenstates .",
    "their potentially significant contribution is nevertheless muffled by the mass - suppressed mixing angles@xcite .",
    "thus a detection of the @xmath0 process would signal the physics beyond the sm , beyond any neutrino mixing mechanism .",
    "we are particularly interested in the possibility of this @xmath0 amplitude being less damped in theories that predict new particles around @xmath8 @xcite@xcite .",
    "one is curious whether the contribution by such heavy particles to the @xmath0 amplitude could be as large as possible while remaining compatible with the decoupling theoremapp - carr - thm .",
    "for example , the suppressions mentioned in the last paragraph both involve at least two powers of heavy particle mass in the denominator .",
    "are there situations in which the amplitude suppression is linear ? in this paper we report a precise calculation of the @xmath0 amplitude s dependence on its intermediate particle masses for the scalar boson loop diagrams .",
    "it shows that , when the intermediate fermion and boson masses are comparable , such a potentially detectable @xmath0 rate is possible . while our result is applicable in any theory that allows this lepton flavor nonconserving decay , in this paper we  present it mainly in the context of `` large extra dimension theories '' as their phenomenology has lately been under active discussion .",

    "these theories can in principle generate the observed gauge hierarchy , for example , by having large extra dimensional volume .",
    "such theoretical suggestion would also provide an added impetus for the ongoing experimental effort to test newton s gravity theory at the millimeter scale .",
    "the hallmark of extra dimensions is the existence of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states : particles that can propagate in the compactified extra dimension have a tower of states with identical quantum numbers but ever increasing masses . for the simplest case of a scalar particle in a five dimensional spacetime , with the extra dimension compactified into a circle ( radius @xmath9 ) ,",
    "we can expand the field @xmath10 in harmonics @xmath11because the extra dimension is a circle , the positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are identified , with @xmath14 leading to the quantization of the extra dimension momentum : @xmath15 where  @xmath16 is the kk number .",
    "this implies a mass spectrum of @xmath17 , where the zero mode bare mass @xmath18 is expected to be much smaller than the kk excitation energy of @xmath19 thus there would be a tower of kk states associated with any particle that can propagate in an extra dimension .    [",

    "propagate in the extra dimensions as well .",
    "furthermore , with the presence of brane , the translational invariance in the extra dimensional space is broken , and the corresponding extra dimension momentum ( the kk number ) is not conserved .    among the different modifications of the original large extra dimension model ,  the most appealing suggestion , to our thinking ,",
    "has been that by appelquist , cheng and dobrescu@xcite who proposed that _ all _ standard model particles , as well as graviton , can propagate in the extra dimensions , thus all particles have kk states .",
    "these are `` universal extra dimensions '' . because brane s presence is no longer required , translational invariance , and kk number conservation , are restored .",
    "there are no vertices involving only one non - zero kk mode .",
    "this  is the key feature that allows such a large extra dimensional theory to pass all the phenomenological tests .",
    "et al_. analyzed the current electroweak data , computed some parameters and concluded that the compactification size @xmath9 could be @xmath20 for one extra dimension and @xmath21 for two extra dimensions .",

    "we shall broadly distinguish two categories of models : in one category , theories do not have kk number conservation , and in such models it s possible that only one of the virtual particles is a heavy kk state . here",
    "the general situation corresponds to mass limits when either the fermion mass is much larger than the boson mass , or the other way around . in the second category",
    ", we consider the kk number conserving universal extra dimension theory . here",
    "both the fermion and boson must have the same kk number and their masses are comparable .",
    "this is so , because their mass square difference is the same as that between their zero modes , which is expected to be much smaller than the kk excitation . in order to consider the comparable mass case",
    ", we will have to compute the one loop amplitude exactly in its dependence of the intermediate particle mass ratio .",

    "in the sm with one doublet of higgs bosons and small dirac neutrino masses , there is only one type of loop diagrams ( fig 1 ) for the @xmath0 decay .",
    "they have a charged intermediate boson in the loop : @xmath27 where the photon is emitted by the charged @xmath28 boson in the loop ( as denoted by the subscript @xmath29 ) .",

    "the @xmath40 case includes the specific situation  of massless neutrinos @xmath41 which leads to a vanishing amplitude , as lepton flavor must be conserved in the massless neutrino limit . for neutrinos with small ( zero mode )",
    "masses @xmath42 , as well as the case when only @xmath28 has kk states , the amplitude is proportional to neutrino mass - squared @xmath43 this results in a branching ratio so small that the decay can not be detected experimentally in the foreseeable future",
    ". one might think that the situation of @xmath44 could offer a better chance of having a less suppressed amplitude .",
    "but this turns out not to be so .",
    "since , for a given kk number , the mass - square - difference is given by that of the zero modes @xmath45 , the amplitude is again suppressed by @xmath46 leading to an undetectably small branching ratio .",

    "several versions of compactification of superstring theory leads to e@xmath47 grand unified theories where each generation of leptons and quarks has a pair of oppositely hypercharged higgs scalar boson .",
    "thus there is strong motivation to consider theories with multiples of scalar bosons .",
    "here we are interested how such scalars , and their possible kk excitations , can contribute to the @xmath48 loop amplitude@xcite . just as in the vector loop case , there is the need to obtain the exact intermediate mass dependence .",
    "we have performed this task and obtained the following result .    in fig 2(a ) we have intermediate states of a charged scalar boson and a neutrino .",

    "the @xmath72 amplitude is somewhat more damped , by the heavy scalar mass @xmath61 as @xmath73 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath0 amplitude in eq ( [ amplitude ] ) , symbolically written as @xmath74 or @xmath75 involves flipping the fermion chirality .",
    "thus the amplitude must be proportional to a fermion mass . before discussing details",
    ", we observe that if we have bulk leptons propagating in the extra dimensions , then chiral symmetry is broken in the effective four dimensional theory by their kaluza - klein states , which are necessarily massive . having a large chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", such theories offer from the outset the possibility for a less suppressed @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "this statement is valid whether the higher dimensional theory has chiral symmetry or not .",
    "our basic assumption is that the zero mode fermion masses are negligibly small compared to their kk excitation .",
    "the largest possible fermion mass that can bring about the chirality change in the @xmath0 amplitude is different in the vector and scalar loop diagrams .    for the vector loop contribution",
    ", we have assumed that there are only left - handed charged current couplings . in such a situation",
    ", helicity change takes place on the external lepton lines  hence the relevant mass is that of the muon .",
    "since the amplitude corresponds to a dimension - five operator , it must have an overall dimension of inverse - mass .",
    "thus , in the vector loop amplitude , we expect a damping factor of @xmath76 as shown in eq ( [ w - amplitude ] ) .",
    "if this was the principal suppression factor , the resultant amplitude and decay rate would still be large .",
    "the unitarity condition for the mixing matrices @xmath77 causes the actual amplitude to be much more damped as the subleading term of the @xmath78-function in eq ( [ f - z ] ) generally has two additional powers of heavy masses in the denominator .",
    "namely , a form of gim mechanism@xcite is operative here .",
    "the scalar loop amplitudes are less suppressed for two reasons : ( 1 ) here the necessary chirality change can be effected by the large intermediate lepton mass , and ( 2 ) in the scalar case there is no cancellation mechanism @xmath79 as in the vector category , to further suppress the amplitude . for the @xmath80 case , the heavy lepton mass @xmath62 in the numerator flips the helicity , and its propagator provides two powers of @xmath62 in the denominator , giving an over all @xmath65 suppression . for the @xmath81 case , either the scalar or lepton propagator can provide the mass power in the denominator . because their masses are comparable , the resultant suppression is again @xmath82    [ [ a - numerical - estimate - of - the - protectmu - eprotectgamma - branching - ratio ] ] a numerical estimate of the @xmath22 branching ratio ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we find it particularly interesting that the @xmath0 amplitude can be less suppressed when the intermediate scalar and lepton masses are comparable , leading to a possibly observable decay rate . from our experience with the sm , we expect the yukawa coupling to be small , on the order of gauge coupling times the ( zero mode ) mass ratio of lepton over gauge boson .",
    "in particular , there has been the suggestion of neutral scalar s coupling to two charged fermions ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) being on the order of @xmath85 this coupling ansatz@xcite has been studied extensively , and found to be compatible with known phenomenology . with this estimate of the yukawa strength ,",
    "the loop in fig 2(b ) with the intermediate states being the kk states of a tau - lepton and a scalar boson would yield a branching ratio of@xmath86for the first excited kk state with @xmath87 and @xmath88 being zero mode lepton masses , eq ( [ estimate ] ) gives a @xmath89 which is comparable to the current experimental limit @xcite of @xmath90 this means that it s entirely conceivable that the rate predicted by the scalar loop effect is within reach of experimental detection in the near future@xcite .",
    "the considerations in this paper can be applied directly to radiative decays of the tau lepton : @xmath91 and @xmath92 to the extent that the final lepton mass being negligibly small compared to the initial lepton mass , the tau decay results involve replacing the muon mass @xmath93 in equations such as eq ( [ w - amplitude ] ) by the tau lepton mass @xmath94 thus an estimate of the branching ratio for the @xmath1 decay yields@xmath95where @xmath96 is the branching ratio @xmath97 and we have used the estimates of @xmath98 and @xmath99 since the existing limit@xcite @xmath100 is still much larger than this estimate , it suggests that such a discovery would only come about after a significant increase in experimental detection efficiency has been achieved . since our model estimate suggests @xmath101 it is even less likely that the decay@xcite @xmath102 would be uncovered any time soon .",
    "we have investigated the dependence by the @xmath0 amplitude on heavy particle masses , finding marked difference between vector and scalar loop contributions . the vector loop amplitude , even in the comparable mass case ,",
    "is strongly suppressed by powers of neutrino mass divided by the heavy mass , leading to such a small rate that the decay is predicted to be unobservable in the foreseeable future .",
    "we have calculated the precise mass - dependence of the scalar loops .",
    "the loop amplitude with a single heavy fermion is less suppressed , not surprisingly , with one power of heavy fermion mass in the denominator .",
    "interestingly , scalar loop amplitudes with approximately equal intermediate scalar and fermion masses ( as , for example , the case in the universal extra dimension theory ) are also less suppressed .",
