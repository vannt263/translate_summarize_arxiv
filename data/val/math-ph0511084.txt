    "difference equations on graphs and differential equations on quantum graphs , even when they resemble laplace or schrdinger operators in many regards , lack one important property of second order elliptic operators , namely uniqueness of continuation .",
    "uniqueness of continuation states that any solution of an elliptic second order equation @xmath2 that vanishes on an open set , is identically zero .",
    "this is known to be an extremely important property with many implications , in particular in spectral theory .",
    "it is also known that elliptic equations of higher orders do not necessarily possess such a property @xcite , which leads to some weird spectral examples as well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this absence of uniqueness of continuation leads for instance to the following possibilities : a periodic `` elliptic second order '' operator on a graph ( quantum graph ) with a co - compact action of an abelian group can have non - empty pure point spectrum ( bound states ) @xcite ; this is an absolute no - no in the continuous case , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is easy to explain this effect for instance as follows : assuming that one has a compact graph with an eigenfunction of the discrete laplacian that has a zero at some vertex , one can attach this graph by that vertex to any other graph and extend the function as zero still keeping it an eigenfunction .",
    "this attachment can also be done in a periodic manner .",
    "such constructions yield these `` strange '' eigenfunctions generated by compactly supported ones .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that all such bound states on periodic graphs are in fact generated by the compactly supported ones @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that laplace operator on the cayley graph of an infinite discrete group can even have solely pure point spectrum @xcite .    using the described above attachment procedure",
    ", one can also easily construct examples when a localized perturbation of a periodic operator does embed an eigenvalue into absolutely continuous spectrum , which is also expected to be impossible in the continuous situation ( albeit this is completely proven in dimensions one only @xcite with just a single result in higher dimension available @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to see what can be said about the eigenfunctions corresponding to such embedded eigenvalues .",
    "we show not only that such an eigenfunction must be compactly supported , but that its support must be contained in a finite width neighborhood of the support of the perturbation , the width dependent on the unperturbed operator only .",
    "thus , effect of the perturbation seems to be of an extremely short range , when being on the absolutely continuous spectrum of the periodic background .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the necessary notions and state and prove the main result for the case of periodic combinatorial graphs ( theorem [ t : main ] ) .",
    "the following section contains formulation and the proof of the analogous result for the quantum graph case ( theorems [ t : main_quantum ] - [ t : main_quantum2 ] ) .",
    "the paper ends with a brief section containing some final remarks .",
    "consider an infinite combinatorial graph @xmath3 with the set of vertices @xmath4 and a faithful co - compact action of the free abelian group @xmath5 ( i.e. , the space of @xmath0-orbits is a finite graph ) .",
    "in fact , in this section we can think of @xmath3 just as of a discrete set @xmath4 of vertices ; the graph structure is not truly relevant here , albeit the main operators of interest usually come from graphs ( e.g. , graph laplacian @xcite ) . without loss of generality , the reader may think of the graph as a discrete subset of @xmath6 invariant with respect to all integer shifts .",
    "we also consider a @xmath0-periodic finite difference operator @xmath7 of a finite order acting on @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the space of all square summable functions on @xmath3 ( i.e. , on @xmath4 ) .",
    "the words `` finite difference operator of a finite order '' mean that the value of @xmath9 at any vertex @xmath10 involves the values of @xmath11 at a finitely many other vertices ( due to periodicity , the number of these vertices is uniformly bounded ) .",
    "such periodic operators are clearly bounded in @xmath8 .",
    "we will fix a ( finite ) fundamental domain @xmath12 for the action of @xmath5 on @xmath4 .",
    "consider for instance the graph below that is a @xmath13-periodic sub - graph of @xmath14 , with the fundamental domain @xmath12 indicated .",
    "[ f : graph ]    an example of a periodic difference operator here could be the version of the laplace operator that subtracts from the value of a function at a vertex its average value at all vertices adjacent to this one : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the degree of the vertex @xmath10 .",
    "this operator is clearly a finite difference operator periodic with respect to the group action",
    ".    we will need to measure the sizes of finite subsets @xmath17 by the number and locations of the shifts of the fundamental domain @xmath12 that are needed to cover @xmath18 . given a finite subset @xmath18 of @xmath3",
    "we will call its _ radius _ the number @xmath19^n\\subset { \\mathbb{z}}^n } \\gamma w\\}.\\ ] ]    we will also need to define two notions of support of a finite difference periodic operator @xmath7 .",
    "first of all , let @xmath20 be a vertex of @xmath3 .",
    "then we introduce the notion of the @xmath20-support of @xmath7 as follows @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the delta function on @xmath4 supported at the vertex @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath23 for @xmath24 . to put it differently ,",
    "the @xmath20-support of @xmath7 consists of all points @xmath10 , values at which of a function @xmath25 influence the values of @xmath26 at @xmath20 .",
    "we also define the @xmath12-support of @xmath7 as @xmath27 in other words , the @xmath12-support of @xmath7 consists of all points @xmath10 values at which of a function @xmath25 influence the values of @xmath26 on @xmath12 .    as always , dealing with a periodic problem , it is advantageous to use the basic transforms of _ floquet theory _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "namely , for any compactly supported ( or sufficiently fast decaying ) function @xmath28 on @xmath4 , we define its _ floquet transform _ as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the action of @xmath31 on the point @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "this is clearly just the fourier transform on the group @xmath0 of periods .",
    "one can notice the easily verifiable cyclic ( or floquet ) identity @xmath35 satisfied for any @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the vector @xmath38 is sometimes called _ floquet multiplier _ , and if being represented as @xmath39 , vector @xmath40 is said to be the _ quasi - momentum _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    relation ( [ e : cyclic ] ) implies that in order to know all the values of the function @xmath41 , it is sufficient to know them for only one representative @xmath10 from each @xmath0-orbit , i.e. for @xmath10 from a fundamental domain of the @xmath0-action as a section of a naturally defined ( depending on @xmath38 ) line bundle over @xmath42 . ] .",
    "thus , we fix such a fundamental domain @xmath12 ( which is a finite set ( graph ) ) and consider only @xmath43 in @xmath41 . we will also denote @xmath41 by @xmath44 , where the latter expression is a function on @xmath12 depending on the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the following statement is immediate :    [ l : laurent ] the images under the floquet transform of the compactly supported functions on @xmath3 are exactly all finite laurent series with @xmath45 . ] in @xmath38 with coefficients in @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , for a compactly supported function @xmath47 , the laurent series of @xmath48 includes only powers @xmath49 that satisfy @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radius of a set @xmath18 introduced in ( [ e : radius ] ) .",
    "we will also need the unit torus @xmath52 it is well known and easy to prove @xcite that the floquet transform ( [ e : floquet ] ) extends to an isometry ( up to a possible constant factor ) between @xmath8 and @xmath53 .",
    "after the floquet transform , @xmath7 becomes the operator of multiplication in @xmath53 by a rational @xmath54 its value @xmath55 on a function @xmath11 that satisfies ( [ e : cyclic ] ) .",
    "we notice that for such a function one has @xmath56 .",
    "thus , writing the values of @xmath11 as a vector @xmath57 , the action of @xmath58 on @xmath59 becomes multiplication by the matrix @xmath60 @xmath61    to formulate our result , we need to introduce another notion .",
    "[ d : floquet_surf ] _ let @xmath62 .",
    "we call _ the floquet surface @xmath63 of the operator @xmath7 at the energy @xmath64 _ the set of all @xmath65 such that the matrix @xmath66 is not invertible ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) .",
    "_    the term _ floquet surface _ is non - standard .",
    "if one considers quasi - momenta @xmath40 instead of the floquet multipliers @xmath38 , one arrives to the standard in solid state physics and theory of periodic equations notion of _ fermi surface _",
    "@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "so , the floquet surface is the fermi one with the natural periodicity with respect to quasimomenta @xmath40 being factored out .",
    "it is clear from the definition that the floquet surface is an algebraic subset of dimension @xmath69 in @xmath70 .",
    "we also look at its intersection with the torus @xmath71 @xmath72 which we will call the _ real floquet surface_. the name comes from the fact that its correspond to real quasimomenta from the fermi surface .",
    "the following standard fact @xcite is easy to prove :    [ l : spectr ] the point @xmath64 belongs to the spectrum of the operator @xmath7 if and only if @xmath73 .",
    "we will also need to introduce some additional notions originating from the solid state physics @xcite .",
    "consider for any @xmath74 the operator @xmath75 which is the restriction of @xmath7 to the space of all ( not square integrable ) functions @xmath47 satisfying the cyclic condition ( [ e : cyclic ] ) .",
    "this is a finite dimensional self - adjoint operator that has a finite spectrum @xmath76 , which can be considered as the graph of a multiple - valued function @xmath77 .",
    "this function is said to be the _ dispersion relation _ and its graph the _",
    "dispersion curve_. the preceding lemma says that the range of this function coincides with the spectrum of @xmath7 in @xmath78 .",
    "arranging the eigenvalues in non - decreasing order splits this curve into continuous ( in fact , piecewise - analytic @xcite ) branches @xmath79 .",
    "their ranges are finite closed segments of the spectral axis called _ spectral bands _ , union of which comprise the whole spectrum @xmath80 .",
    "this is the so called band - gap structure of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the ( complex ) floquet surface is never empty , but when @xmath64 changes , it moves around .",
    "the lemma says that whenever it hits the torus @xmath71 , @xmath64 belongs to the spectrum .",
    "it is natural to expect that when @xmath64 is a generic point in the interior of the spectrum , then the real floquet surface will be a variety of the maximal possible real dimension @xmath69 in the torus .",
    "this is confirmed by the following statement .",
    "[ l : inside_band ] if @xmath64 belongs to the interior of a spectral band of the operator @xmath7 , then the real floquet surface has a part which is a smooth @xmath69-dimensional hyper - surface in @xmath71 .",
    "* the sketch of the proof of the lemma * ( see more details in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath64 belongs to the interior of the band formed by the branch @xmath79",
    ". then function @xmath81 changes sign on @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the real floquet surface separates @xmath71 .",
    "now the known analytic structure of the floquet surface ( it is an analytic , or even algebraic in discrete situation set ) leads to the conclusion of the lemma ( see more details of this part of the argument in @xcite ) .    in",
    "what follows , we will need to know that the floquet surface of @xmath7 is irreducible as an algebraic variety .",
    "this is not always true , but for instance it is conjectured that this is always true if @xmath7 is the discrete schrdinger operator on @xmath13 with potential periodic with respect to a sublattice @xcite .",
    "this probably is true in any dimension .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in @xmath82 irreducibility holds for all but a finitely many of values of the spectral parameter @xmath64 .",
    "examples of some separable cases when irreducibility has been proven can be found in @xcite .",
    "after all this preparation , let us now move to the formulation of the main problem we address in this paper . consider any _ local _ difference operator @xmath83 , i.e. such that its action on a function @xmath11 involves only the function s values on a finite set @xmath17 and the resulting function @xmath84 is supported on @xmath18 as well .",
    "we are interested in the perturbation of the spectrum of @xmath7 that occurs when the operator is perturbed by adding @xmath83 : @xmath85 .",
    "if we assume at this point that @xmath7 is self - adjoint , it is a general fact that an additional point spectrum might arise ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also the common expectation that this impurity spectrum due to local perturbations should not be embedded into the continuous spectrum of @xmath7 , which is proven for perturbations of a homogeneous background ( see the book @xcite for a detailed survey ) . in the case of localized perturbations of a periodic background ,",
    "absence of embedded eigenvalues is proven for periodic schrdinger operators in @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "albeit the same must surely be true in any dimension , the problem in dimensions higher than @xmath87 is hard and only one limited result is known @xcite . in the discrete ( graph ) situation , embedded eigenvalues can arise very easily , due to non - trivial graph topology .",
    "examples of such compactly supported eigenfunctions can be easily constructed using the attachment procedure described before .",
    "one might want to ask whether compactness of support of the eigenfunctions corresponding to embedded eigenvalues is the only possibility , and if yes , whether there are any _ a priori _ bounds on the size of their supports .",
    "somewhat surprising answer is given by the following result .",
    "[ t : main ] let @xmath83 be a local perturbation supported on a finite set @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath88 for any @xmath47 ) of a periodic operator @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath64 belong to the interior of a spectral band of @xmath7 , the corresponding floquet surface be irreducible , and @xmath64 be an embedded eigenvalue for @xmath85 .",
    "then the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath89 of @xmath85 is compactly supported and moreover , @xmath90 the constant @xmath91 can be usually improved for specific periodic difference operators @xmath7 .",
    "( here @xmath92 is defined in ( [ e : supp_operator ] ) . )",
    "so , the effect of the impurity seems to be of very short range .",
    "this theorem will be deduced from the following more general statement :    [ t : nonhomogeneous ] let @xmath64 belong to the interior of a spectral band of @xmath7 , the corresponding floquet surface be irreducible , and @xmath25 be a compactly supported function on the graph .",
    "assume that the equation @xmath93 has an @xmath94-solution @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath95 is compactly supported and moreover , @xmath96 where the constant @xmath91 can be usually improved for specific periodic difference operators @xmath7 .",
    "* proof of theorem [ t : nonhomogeneous]*. since function @xmath25 is compactly supported , its floquet transform @xmath97 is a laurent polynomial with degrees @xmath98 bounded by @xmath99 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath100 the vector @xmath101 and introduce @xmath102 .",
    "we can represent @xmath103 as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a polynomial that involves only ( non - negative ) degrees @xmath31 with @xmath106 .",
    "taking floquet transform in the equation ( [ e : inhom ] ) , we rewrite it as @xmath107 we can rewrite the laurent matrix function @xmath66 as @xmath108 , where the matrix function @xmath109 is a polynomial in @xmath38 involving only the powers @xmath49 with @xmath110 .",
    "then its inverse can be represented as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a matrix polynomial ( transposed to the co - factor matrix of @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 is a scalar polynomial ( determinant of @xmath113 ) , which vanishes exactly on the floquet surface .",
    "thus , @xmath115 notice that @xmath83 involves only powers @xmath49 with @xmath116 .",
    "we know that @xmath117 is an @xmath118-function on @xmath71 . on the other hand , the right hand side of ( [ e",
    ": divide ] ) is , up to the factor @xmath119 , the ratio of two holomorphic polynomials in @xmath70 .",
    "we also know that zeros of the denominator @xmath114 in @xmath120are irreducible and intersect the torus @xmath71 over an @xmath121-dimensional variety .",
    "this means that unless the numerator @xmath122 vanishes on @xmath71 at these zeros to their degrees , the ratio has a singularity that is not square integrable .",
    "thus , the numerator vanishes to that degree , and due to the irreducibility of zeros , the same is true for all zeros in @xmath120 ( see @xcite for the details of this simple argument ) .",
    "if there were no zeros of the denominator in @xmath123 , then , as a corollary of hilbert s nullstellensatz , the ratio would be a holomorphic polynomial of @xmath38 .",
    "we can not , however , exclude existence of a factor like @xmath124 in @xmath114 .",
    "if it does exist , we have @xmath125 ( since each term in @xmath58 is like that ) .",
    "factoring this power out , we represent @xmath58 as @xmath126 , where zeros of @xmath58 and @xmath127 in @xmath120 are the same ( including their orders ) , and thus our ratio is a holomorphic polynomial times @xmath128 .",
    "notice that division does not increase the degree of a polynomial with respect to any variable .",
    "the degree of @xmath129 has been estimated as @xmath130 .",
    "the additional degree acquired during multiplication by @xmath83 and division by @xmath127 does not exceed @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath132 is a polynomial involving the degrees @xmath49 with @xmath133 only .",
    "one can calculate now that the effect of the outside factor of @xmath119 and of @xmath128 coming from the denominator is to reduce the expression to a laurent polynomial with degrees @xmath134 involved with @xmath135 .",
    "we see that @xmath117 is a laurent polynomial which contains powers of @xmath38 estimated by @xmath136 . reversing the floquet transform",
    ", we get the statement of the theorem .",
    "let us now address the * proof of theorem [ t : main ] * , which is rather simple .",
    "indeed , the conditions of the theorem imply the equality @xmath137 , or in a form more convenient for us , @xmath138 the function @xmath139 is supported on @xmath18 .",
    "thus theorem [ t : nonhomogeneous ] applies and proves the statement .",
    "we now switch to the case of a perturbed periodic quantum graph . we will remind the reader the main definitions concerning quantum graphs .",
    "one can find more details concerning quantum graphs in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "a quantum graph @xmath3 has each its edge @xmath140 equipped with a coordinate @xmath141 ( when no confusion is possible , we use just @xmath20 instead ) .",
    "this coordinate identifies @xmath140 with a segment @xmath142 $ ] of the real line .",
    "we will also assume that a schrdinger operator @xmath143 with appropriate vertex conditions ( all such self - adjoint conditions are described in @xcite ) is defined on @xmath3 .",
    "the results of this section hold for any of such conditions , however just for simplicity of presentation we will assume that the conditions at each vertex are the `` standard '' neumann - kirchhoff ones : @xmath144 where the sum is taken over all edges incident with the vertex and the derivatives are taken away from the vertex .    as in the previous section , we assume that the graph is acted upon freely and co - compactly by the group @xmath5 that leaves the graph structure ( including edges lengths ) and the hamiltonian @xmath145 invariant .",
    "we use the same letter @xmath12 as before for a fundamental domain of this action .",
    "one can now introduce the notions of the floquet transform and floquet variety of @xmath145 analogously to the way it was done in the previous section .",
    "for instance ,    [ d : floquet_quantum ] _ let @xmath62 .",
    "we call _ the floquet surface @xmath146 of the operator @xmath145 at the energy @xmath64 _ the set of all @xmath65 such that the equation @xmath147 has a non - trivial solution @xmath11 that is cyclic with the floquet multiplier @xmath38 , i.e. such that @xmath148 , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 . here , as before , @xmath151 .",
    "_    we can also introduce the same assumption about irreducibility .",
    "the main result of this section is the quantum graph analog of theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "[ t : main_quantum ] let @xmath152 be supported on a finite set @xmath18 of edges .",
    "let @xmath64 belong to the interior of a spectral band of @xmath145 , the corresponding floquet surface be irreducible , and @xmath64 be an embedded eigenvalue for @xmath153 .",
    "then the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath154 of @xmath153 is compactly supported and moreover , @xmath155 here @xmath156 is a constant depending on the unperturbed operator @xmath145 only and for any set of vertices @xmath18 we define @xmath157 as the set of all vertices that are either in @xmath18 , or adjacent to the ones in @xmath18 .    it is possible to give some explicit estimates for the constant @xmath156 , similarly to how it was done for the discrete case",
    ". here , however , the situation depends on whether or not @xmath64 is the dirichlet eigenvalue of @xmath145 on an edge of the graph .",
    "[ t : main_quantum1 ] let @xmath152 be supported on a finite set @xmath18 of edges .",
    "assume that @xmath64 belongs to the interior of a spectral band of @xmath145 and is not a dirichlet eigenvalue on any of the edges , the corresponding floquet surface is irreducible , and @xmath64 is an embedded eigenvalue for @xmath153 .",
    "then the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath154 of @xmath153 is compactly supported and moreover , @xmath158 here we consider @xmath12 as a set of vertices .    in case",
    "when @xmath64 does belong to the dirichlet spectrum of at least one of the edges , the situation is different , and one needs to modify the graph somewhat .",
    "we would like to guarantee that @xmath64 does not contain any points of dirichlet spectra of @xmath145 and of @xmath153 on any of the edges of the graph .",
    "this is easy to achieve by introducing `` fake '' vertices . indeed ,",
    "if all the edges are sufficiently short , this condition is satisfied .",
    "now , modulo the periodicity , there are only finitely many edges in the graph .",
    "hence , one can introduce a finite set of periodic families of interior points on the edges , such that including these points as new vertices of degree two , one achieves the desired result . imposing neumann - kirchhoff conditions ( [ e : conditions ] ) at these vertices ( in the case of a vertex of degree two they just mean continuity of the function and its derivative ) , one makes sure that they do not influence the spectra of @xmath145 and of @xmath153 at all .",
    "this reduces the situation to the case of theorem [ t : main_quantum1 ] , however with an increased number of vertices in the fundamental domain .",
    "let us call this new set @xmath159 .",
    "then clearly theorem [ t : main_quantum1 ] , if proven , implies the next theorem , and thus also theorem [ t : main_quantum ] :    [ t : main_quantum2 ] let @xmath152 be supported on a finite set @xmath18 of edges .",
    "assume that @xmath64 belongs to the interior of a spectral band of @xmath145 and is not a dirichlet eigenvalue on any of the edges , the corresponding floquet surface is irreducible , and @xmath64 is an embedded eigenvalue for @xmath153 .",

    "since we are guaranteed that a neighborhood of @xmath64 is free of dirichlet spectra of individual edges , one can use the standard procedure of reducing the spectral problems for @xmath145 and for @xmath153 for the quantum graph to the one for a combinatorial one ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "namely , assume that one solves the following problem on the graph : @xmath161 since @xmath64 is not in the dirichlet spectrum on each edge , one can solve the equation on each edge , assuming the knowledge of vertex values of the function , and then express the neumann data at the vertices as a linear combination of vertex values .",
    "thus , the only condition that still remains to be satisfied is that the outgoing derivatives at each vertex add up to zero .",
    "this clearly will take form of an equation @xmath162 satisfied at each vertex @xmath11 of the graph .",

    "conversely , if @xmath180 , then there is a cyclic vertex function @xmath11 with the floquet multiplier @xmath38 such that @xmath181 .",
    "let us use it as dirichlet data on each edge to solve @xmath182 on each edge .",
    "the first claim of the lemma guarantees that we get a solution @xmath47 of @xmath167 .",
    "we claim that @xmath47 is cyclic with the floquet multiplier @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath150 the functions @xmath183 and @xmath184 satisfy the same equation @xmath182 on each edge and have the same dirichlet data .",
    "since we avoided dirichlet spectrum , we conclude that @xmath185 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "we can now finish the proof of the theorem [ t : main_quantum ] .",
    "indeed , the previous lemma guarantees that switching from the differential periodic and perturbed problems @xmath169 and @xmath168 to the combinatorial problems @xmath163 and @xmath165 , one lands in the conditions of theorem [ t : main ] . now",
    "the same lemma implies that the conclusion of the theorem [ t : main ] about the vertex values implies the conclusion of theorem [ t : main_quantum ] about the whole function @xmath47 .",
    "* the notion of the `` radius '' @xmath51 of a finite set in @xmath3 depends on the choice of a fundamental domain @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , choosing @xmath12 further away from @xmath18 increases @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the optimal way to use the estimates of the main theorems is to choose a fundamental domain @xmath12 in such a way that @xmath51 is the smallest possible for a given support @xmath18 of the perturbation .",
    "this would lead to the best localization estimate for the embedded eigenfunctions . * as it has already been mentioned in the previous section , the neumann - kirchhoff conditions ( [ e : conditions ] ) are chosen for simplicity of exposition sake only . since the results concerning combinatorial graphs are obtained under very general conditions on the periodic operator @xmath7 , the statement of theorem [ t : main_quantum ] and its proof carry through if one uses the general self - adjoint vertex conditions ( described for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "one might have to deal with matrix difference operators @xmath7 , which causes no problem .",
    "however , the specific estimates of the constant @xmath156 of theorem [ t : main_quantum ] given in theorems [ t : main_quantum1 ] and [ t : main_quantum2 ] will have to change depending on the vertex conditions . * a deficiency of the results of this paper ( as well as of the results of @xcite ) is that our technique does not let us treat the case of eigenvalues embedded at spectral edges .",
    "* it is clear from both this paper and @xcite that question of irreducibility of the floquet surface ( equivalently , of the fermi surface , modulo natural periodicity ) is intimately related to the problem of existence and behavior of embedded eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "this does not look like an artifact of the techniques used .",
    "it is clear that not arbitrary periodic difference operator satisfies this condition ( even higher order periodic elliptic differential operators do not @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been proven for discrete schrdinger operator @xmath186 on @xmath13 with potential periodic with respect to a sublattice , that irreducibility holds except possibly for finitely many values of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured in the book @xcite that irreducibility always holds for this operator ( similar statement is probably correct in any dimension ) .",
    "+ irreducibility is also known for such operators ( both discrete and continuous ) with separable potentials @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is even sufficient to have in dimension three the potential to separate as @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "this follows from the results on irreducibility of bloch variety in dimension two @xcite . + an advantage of dealing with a difference operator is a possibility of sometimes explicitly computing the determinant @xmath114 and thus checking its irreducibility .",
    "+ in fact , examination of the proofs of this text , as well as of @xcite shows that we do not need complete irreducibility .",
    "what truly required , is that every irreducible component of the floquet variety intersects the torus @xmath71 over an @xmath69 dimensional set .",
    "however , it is not clear how to control this property , and thus it is doubtful that such weaker condition will work better than the full irreducibility . * as it has been mentioned already , pathologies like pure point spectrum of periodic operators and embedded eigenvalues might and do sometimes appear in discrete or quantum graph situation .",
    "however , they do not necessarily have to .",
    "indeed , it is known @xcite that the discrete schrdinger operator @xmath186 on the lattice @xmath1 with a potential periodic with respect to a sublattice has absolutely continuous spectrum . this can be proven by the standard l.  thomas argument @xcite . similarly , there are some cases when one can prove that embedded eigenvalues do not arise from local perturbations of periodic discrete operators .",
    "assume for instance that a difference operator @xmath188 on the integer lattice @xmath1 ( the operator could in particular be our perturbed operator @xmath85 ) has the following property : there exists an oriented hyperplane @xmath189 in @xmath6 such that for any point @xmath190 there exists a point @xmath191 such that @xmath192 contains the point @xmath193 and lies completely on the `` positive '' side of the parallel shift @xmath194 to the point @xmath193 , with the only intersection with @xmath194 at @xmath193 .",
    "then the equation @xmath195 has no compactly supported solutions . indeed ,",
    "if there were such a solution @xmath47 , consider a support hyperplane @xmath194 to @xmath196 such that the whole @xmath196 is on the negative side of @xmath194 and @xmath197 .",
    "consider the point @xmath20 that serves @xmath193 as described above .",
    "then the equality @xmath198 clearly implies that @xmath199 , which is a contradiction .",
    "+ this in particular proves the quoted above fact about absence of point spectrum for periodic schrdinger operators on integer lattices .",
    "* it would be interesting to understand how much the assumption of commutativity of the group of periods influences the validity of the results of this paper .",
    "we do not know the answer to this question , but one probably should not expect to be able to go beyond the class of groups of polynomial growth ( and hence , according to m.  gromov s result @xcite , virtually nilpotent ones ) . indeed ,",
    "the results already quoted about the unusual spectral behavior of the lamplighter group ( which is of an intermediate growth ) @xcite show that one might expect surprises there . *",
    "the approach used in this work has been previously used by the authors in different circumstances in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
