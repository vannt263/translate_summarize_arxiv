    "spin foam models @xcite constitute an exciting proposal for the definition of a background independent and non - perturbative quantization of general relativity .",
    "they were introduced originally @xcite as a way to implement the dynamics of loop quantum gravity @xcite , and can be thought of as representing a sum over histories of the gravitational field @xcite .    in three spacetime dimensions , pure gravity being a topological theory ( in the sense that it has no local degrees of freedom ) , spin foam models",
    "can be obtained as an exact simplicial path integral for the first - order palatini action , where the gauge group is taken to be @xmath1 in riemannian signature ( the whole symmetry group is larger than @xmath1 and depends on the sign of the cosmological constant @xmath2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the celebrated ponzano - regge @xcite and turaev - viro @xcite models when @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "their vertex amplitudes are simply given by @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( for @xmath6 a root of unity ) @xmath7 coefficients .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the ponzano - regge amplitudes can be obtained from a canonical quantization of @xmath8 gravity in the spirit of loop quantum gravity , in which the kinematical states are given by spin networks , and the dynamics leads to a spin foam evolution .",
    "the turaev - viro amplitudes can also be obtained as the scalar product between physical states which are in turn given in terms of unitary representations of some quantum groups closely related to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in three dimensions , there is a clear understanding of the relationship between the so - called canonical and covariant approaches to quantum gravity ( at least when the signature is riemannian ) .    in four spacetime dimensions ,",
    "the construction of such a correspondence between the canonical and spin foam quantizations is still an open problem @xcite .",
    "since it is technically too involved to follow the construction of the three - dimensional theory and perform the straight simplicial path integral quantization of the four - dimensional palatini action ( see @xcite for an attempt to follow this direction ) , spin foam models have to be derived using an alternative strategy .",
    "more precisely , the approach to four - dimensional spin foam models is based on the fact that gravity can be formulated as a constrained topological field theory , by virtue of the so - called plebanski action @xcite .",
    "this latter is defined as the sum of a well - known topological @xmath9 action @xcite , plus a set of constraints on the @xmath0 field ensuring on - shell the condition that it comes from the exterior product of two tetrad one - form fields . with this solution for the @xmath0 field",
    ", the plebanski action reduces at the classical level to the usual hilbert - palatini action of first order general relativity . to derive a spin foam model ,",
    "the following general strategy is adopted .",
    "first , the topological @xmath9 theory is discretized exactly on a two - complex , and the basic variables , i.e. the @xmath0 field and holonomies of the spacetime connection , are promoted to quantum operators .",
    "then , the simplicity constraints are imposed at the quantum level as restrictions on group - theoretical data .",
    "the main challenge in this approach is essentially to impose consistently these second class simplicity constraints , and several proposals defining the different available spin foam models have been put forward in order to do so .",
    "the three spin foam models for four - dimensional quantum gravity that have been studied the most are the barrett - crane ( bc ) model @xcite , the engle - pereira - rovelli - livine ( eprl ) model @xcite , and the freidel - krasnov ( fk ) model @xcite .",
    "they all rely on the general strategy outlined above , even though their construction requires to impose the simplicity constraints in drastically different ways . in the bc model , which was the first four - dimensional model to be introduced ,",
    "the simplicity constraints are imposed as strong operator relations .",
    "this has the result of assigning simple representations of the gauge group to faces of the dual triangulation @xmath10 , and a specific unique intertwiner , known as the bc intertwiner @xcite , to edges of @xmath10 .",
    "due to difficulties in reproducing the correct semiclassical limit @xcite and the structure of the graviton propagator @xcite , this model was partly discarded , and the search for new models was motivated with the additional hope to relate the spin foam quantization to the canonical structure of loop quantum gravity .",
    "this search culminated with the introduction of the eprl and fk models , which are both based on the introduction of a linear version of the ( originally quadratic ) simplicity constraints @xcite , and take as an important additional input the inclusion of the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "in these two models , the over - imposition of the simplicity constraints which is thought to be responsible for the issues with the bc vertex , is cured by using a weak imposition by means of coherent states for the fk model , or the gupta - bleuler scheme for the eprl model .",
    "our goal here is not to review extensively the details of these constructions , but rather to focus on the implementation of the simplicity constraints by introducing a model which allows for an immediate comparison between the alternative schemes .",
    "in fact , it has been argued on several occasions @xcite that the current spin foam models miss the imposition of additional secondary second class constraints that are generated by the usual simplicity constraints .",
    "the usual point of view in the derivation of spin foam models is that it might be sufficient to impose the primary simplicity constraints consistently at all times , since the secondary constraints arise in fact as a consequence of this requirement .",
    "but even if this is true at the classical level , at the quantum level the secondary constraints are allowed to have non - vanishing fluctuations , and ought therefore be imposed as well .",
    "it is however very hard in the four - dimensional case to implement concretely this idea . in other words",
    ", we understand that there is a difficulty which needs to be resolved in the current four - dimensional spin foam models , but even if we have generic arguments indicating how to do so , a concrete realization has never been put forward .",
    "let us summarize the situation . at the classical level",
    ", it is clear that the plebanski action is equivalent to the palatini action once the @xmath0 field is forced to be simple .",
    "but since we do not know how to compute the simplicial path integral for the palatini action , we try to compute that of the plebanski action by first quantizing the unconstrained topological theory and then imposing the simplicity constraints at the quantum level .",
    "in fact , it is quite clear that we are restricted in our understanding of how to properly perform this last step , by the fact that we do no know what to `` expect '' from the spin foam quantization of the four - dimensional plebanski action .",
    "for this reason , it would be nice to have a model in which we could work out explicitly the two alternative methods . by this , we mean that we would like to perform the spin foam quantization of the action in which the simplicity constraints have already been solved at the classical level , and then compare this result to the spin foam quantization in which the simplicity constraints are solved in the quantum theory",
    ". this would be a way to test the various proposals to deal with the simplicity constraints .",
    "it has already been argued in the literature @xcite that dealing with second class constraints at the quantum level can lead to inconsistencies , and is not compatible with the quantization program  la dirac .",
    "however , the argument alone is not fully convincing , since it was formulated on a finite dimensional model with no clear analogy with gravity , and since it does not give a clear explanation for how the various impositions of the constraints in the four - dimensional spin foam models should lead to a model with inconsistent physical predictions .",
    "it might very well be that despite the fact that we are dealing with second class constraints at the quantum level , there exists a preferred scheme in which the simplicity constraints can be imposed in a ( yet - to - be defined ) robust way to lead to an acceptable model for quantum gravity . in the end , the only way to discriminate between the various proposals is either to extract physical predictions to compare with experiments , or at least to test the strategies on toy models which bear a close analogies with gravity .",
    "let us also point out that a model was introduced in @xcite in order to illustrate the claim that additional secondary second class constraints should be taken into account in the spin foam models .",
    "this model is based on the idea of reducing a four - dimensional @xmath11 @xmath9 theory to an @xmath1 one by means of simplicity constraints , and demonstrates that this is only possible if certain secondary second class constraints are imposed .",
    "the weak point of this model is that the constraints that it imposes are not derived from the hamiltonian analysis of a given plebanski theory , but are instead put in by hand .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate a robust model which allows to test the imposition of the spin foam simplicity constraints .",
    "since pure gravity is always topological in three spacetime dimensions , it makes a priori no sense to have a plebanski formulation in which the @xmath0 field is forced to be simple .",
    "in fact three - dimensional @xmath9 theory is already equivalent to gravity , when @xmath0 is a one - form field valued in the lie algebra of @xmath1 .",
    "however , if one replaces the gauge group @xmath1 by @xmath11 ( or its double cover @xmath12 ) , the three - dimensional theory admits simplicity constraints @xmath13 similar to that of the four - dimensional theory . in the gravitational sector of solution to these simplicity constraint",
    ", the action becomes that of first order riemannian gravity . in the topological sector",
    ", the theory is trivial .",
    "therefore , at the classical level , the plebanski theory that we introduce reduces to the hilbert - palatini action , whose spin foam quantization naturally leads to the ponzano - regge amplitudes .",
    "now , it is also possible to perform the spin foam quantization of the three - dimensional @xmath11 @xmath9 theory , and to impose the simplicity constraints at the quantum level , mimicking in particular the prescription of the bc and eprl models .",
    "this allows for a direct verification of whether any of these proposals leads to the proper vertex amplitude .",
    "our construction can be summarized in the diagram of figure [ diagram ] .    .",
    "after imposition of the simplicity constraints @xmath13 , it reduces to the usual hilbert - palatini action , whose discretized partition function @xmath14 can be computed explicitly .",
    "the question we want to ask is whether it is possible to derive the same vertex amplitude by imposing the simplicity constraints at the quantum level on the partition function @xmath15 for the unconstrained action .",
    "in other words , does the imposition of the simplicity constraints  la bc or eprl render this diagram commutative ?",
    "if not , what is the additional input which is necessary in order to reconstruct the ponzano - regge model from the spin foam quantization of the three - dimensional plebanski action ? ]    we start in section [ sec1 ] by introducing the classical framework for our analysis . in particular , we show how the three - dimensional @xmath11 @xmath9 action is reduced by the simplicity constraints to the usual action for three - dimensional gravity , and we perform the hamiltonian analysis of the plebanski theory to support this fact .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to the study of the quantum theory .",
    "we first recall the state sum model corresponding to the constrained classical action , and then perform the spin form quantization of the plebanski theory .",
    "for this , we start by writing down the simplicial path integral for the @xmath11 @xmath9 theory , and then study the imposition of the simplicity constraints . in particular",
    ", we study the bc and eprl prescriptions , in which the constraints are imposed strongly and weakly ( in a sense that we will make more precise ) , respectively .",
    "we also study the so - called warsaw modification @xcite of the eprl model in order to illustrate its signification on the three - dimensional model at hand .",
    "our conclusion is that the bc prescription can not lead to the proper vertex amplitude , whereas the eprl prescription , when supplemented with the imposition of the additional secondary second class constraints , enables one to recover the expected result .",
    "this might be a strong indication of the fact that a weak imposition of the simplicity constraints in the quantum theory is an important ingredient in order to derive the vertex amplitude of four - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "nevertheless , we want to emphasize that in our three - dimensional model , none of above - mentioned proposals lead by themselves to the proper vertex amplitude , which is that of the ponzano - regge model .",
    "the reason for this is clear : the current spin foam models miss the imposition of the secondary second class constraints that are exhibited in the canonical analysis of the plebanski theory . indeed ,",
    "we show how these constraints can be solved by imposing conditions on the spatial components of the connection , and how their imposition in the path integral with the eprl prescription allows to recover the proper vertex amplitude .",
    "to introduce our model , let us start with the familiar @xmath9 action , written in three dimensions and for the gauge group @xmath11 . in terms of an @xmath16-valued one - form field @xmath17 (",
    "our notations are defined in appendix [ notations ] ) and the spacetime connection @xmath18 , it is given by [ bf action ] s_[b , ] = 12_^3x^(b_,f _ ) = 12_^3x^b_ijf_^ij , where @xmath19 denotes a trace in the lie algebra @xmath16 , and @xmath20 is the curvature two - form associated to the connection . clearly , this action is not that of riemannian three - dimensional first order gravity , but this latter ( or at least two copies of it ) can be obtained if we use a decomposition of the fields into self - dual and anti self - dual components .",
    "here we are not interested in doing this decomposition , because our goal is to mimic the constrained four - dimensional action which is the starting point for the spin foam quantization . to see that this is indeed possible ,",
    "let us proceed in two steps .",
    "first , let us assume that the @xmath0 field is of the form b^ij_=^ij _  kl^ke^l _ , where @xmath21 is a zero - form in @xmath22 , and @xmath23 a lie algebra - valued one - form .",
    "this is the three - dimensional analogue of the notion of simple two - form field that is used in four - dimensional plebanski theory .",
    "second , let us choose a gauge ( which we will refer to as the time - gauge ) in which @xmath24 .",
    "this gauge choice reduces the symmetry group @xmath11 to its @xmath1 subgroup .",
    "a key observation is that it is always possible to fix @xmath25 due to the presence of the `` scaling '' symmetry [ rescaling ] ^i^i , e^i_1e^i _ , for @xmath26 . with this choice of gauge , the action ( [ bf action ] )",
    "becomes the usual action for gravity in ( [ gravity action ] ) involves connection components of the type @xmath27 .",
    "however , one can see that these terms appear quadratically as lagrange multipliers , and that they are therefore vanishing by virtue of the equations of motion . ] [ gravity action ] s_[b(e),]=s_[e,]=12_^3x^_ijke^i_f^jk_. we have included the first equality to make explicit the fact that the three - dimensional hilbert - palatini action is simply a constrained @xmath9 action .",
    "this argument suggests that it is possible to obtain the action for gravity starting from ( [ bf action ] ) if we impose a simplicity - like condition on the @xmath0 field , and pick up a rotational @xmath1 subgroup of @xmath11 by making a gauge choice for @xmath28 ( notice that this choice is not canonical ) .",
    "we are going to see in this section that the simplicity of the @xmath0 field can be enforced with a plebanski action whose hamiltonian analysis will be detailed .",
    "as we mentioned above , the first things that we would like to do is to impose the simplicity of the @xmath0 field in the @xmath11 @xmath9 theory .",
    "following what is done in four dimensions , we are going to introduce the plebanski action as the sum of the @xmath9 action ( [ bf action ] ) plus a set of constraints on the @xmath0 field .",
    "our aim is to reproduce simplicity - like conditions ensuring that we are indeed dealing with three - dimensional gravity .",
    "the action that we consider is field are contracted with those of the multiplier @xmath29 , and not those of the antisymmetric levi - civita symbol .",
    "this is similar to what happens in the four - dimensional plebanski theory when the multiplier acts on the spacetime indices of the @xmath0 field . ]",
    "[ 3d plebanski ] s_[b , , ] = s_[b,]+   = 12_^3x(^(b_,f_)+^(b_,b _ ) ) , where @xmath30 denotes the hodge dual operator in @xmath16 , and @xmath31 is a symmetric lagrange multiplier used to enforce the constraints [ simplicity ] _ ( b_,b_)=12_ijklb^ij_b^kl_0 .",
    "we want to understand the exact meaning of these constraints in the present context .",
    "the key difference with four - dimensional plebanski theory is that we are dealing here with vectors , and not bivectors .",
    "therefore , we need another notion of simplicity than the usual one used in spin foam models . as we have already mentioned earlier , we are going to say that a vector @xmath17 is simple if it can be written as b^ij_=^ij _  kl^ke^l _ , where @xmath21 is a zero - form in @xmath22 , and @xmath23 a one - form .",
    "the fact that the constraint @xmath13 defined by ( [ simplicity ] ) can be used to obtain simple vectors is ensured by the following proposition :    [ prop ] when the simplicity constraints @xmath13 are satisfied , there are three possible solutions for the @xmath0 field .",
    "they correspond respectively to :    * a gravitational sector , in which there exists an @xmath22-valued one form @xmath32 and a vector @xmath28 in @xmath33 such that @xmath34 * a topological sector , in which there exists an @xmath33-valued one form @xmath32 and a vector @xmath28 in @xmath33 such that @xmath35 * a degenerate sector , in which @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "let us introduce the boost and rotational components of the field @xmath17 .",
    "they are given respectively by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "each of these one - forms can be interpreted as a vector in @xmath40 , and the simplicity constraints simply mean that the vectors @xmath41 are orthogonal to the vectors @xmath42 , i.e. [ simplicitygeom ] l_k_=0 , , .",
    "let us first assume that the three vectors @xmath43 form a basis of @xmath40",
    ". due to the simplicity constraints ( [ simplicitygeom ] ) , the three remaining vectors @xmath41 are linked , and therefore they lie in the same plane , whose ( non - necessarily unit ) normal is denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "more precisely , there exist three vectors @xmath45 such that [ kgrav ] k_=e_. furthermore , since the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath41 are orthogonal , we can write to [ bgrav ] l_=^0e_-e^0 _ , where @xmath46 is a ( non - vanishing ) scalar , and @xmath47 is a real - valued one form .",
    "due to the fact that the vectors @xmath43 form a basis , the three vectors @xmath45 form a basis as well .",
    "the solution given by ( [ kgrav ] ) and ( [ bgrav ] ) corresponds to the gravitational sector .",
    "if we assume on the contrary that the three vectors @xmath41 form a basis , the same construction can be used to obtain the topological sector described in proposition [ prop ] .",
    "when @xmath36 and @xmath37 , i.e. neither the @xmath41 nor the @xmath43 form a basis , we say that the @xmath0 field belongs to the degenerate sector .",
    "it is clear from the expression of @xmath17 in the gravitational sector that in the time gauge , where we have @xmath48 and @xmath25 , the boost component @xmath38 is vanishing , while the rotational component @xmath39 reduces to the triad @xmath49 .",
    "this supports the heuristic argument that we have given at the beginning of this section in order to derive the action ( [ gravity action ] ) from the @xmath11 @xmath9 theory .",
    "note also that in the gravitational sector we have @xmath36 , while in the topological sector we have @xmath37 .",
    "let us conclude with a remark .",
    "there are 6 simplicity constraints @xmath50 acting on the 18 components @xmath17 of the @xmath0 field .",
    "therefore we expect the simple @xmath0 field to be written in terms of 12 components only . here , we have expressed @xmath0 in terms of the 16 components @xmath28 and @xmath32 . however ,",
    "notice that there are 4 redundant components due to the presence of the following symmetries :    * a rescaling symmetry , given by ( [ rescaling ] ) , which allows to remove one component ( for instance , we can fix @xmath51 ) . *",
    "three translational symmetries acting in the non - degenerate sector .",
    "they are generated by a vector @xmath52 , and act like e^i_e^i_+_^i , e^0_e^0_+_^0 . as a consequence",
    ", we can always choose @xmath53 , but here we do not make this choice in order not to break the @xmath11 symmetry of the theory .",
    "now that we have a good understanding of how the simplicity constraints can be used to define a sector of the plebanski theory in which the vector @xmath17 is simple , let us see how it is possible to recover the action for three - dimensional gravity . for this",
    ", we are going to study separately the gravitational and topological sectors introduced in proposition ( [ prop ] ) .    using the decomposition of @xmath16 into self - dual and anti self - dual generators ( see appendix [ so4 ] ) , we can write the @xmath0 field as b^ij_=^b^i_^j^ij_i+^b^i_^j^ij_i , where @xmath54 , and the @xmath9 action ( [ bf action ] ) therefore becomes [ bf selfdual ] s_[^b,^b,^,^]=12_^3x^((^b_,^f_)+(^b_,^f _ ) ) . as usual , the equations of motion with respect to the connection @xmath55 lead to the torsion - free condition t(^b,^)=0 , and if @xmath56 , this relation can be inverted to find the torsion - free spin connection .",
    "this latter , when plugged back into the original action ( [ bf selfdual ] ) , leads to the sum of two second order einstein - hilbert actions , [ einstein - hilbert ] s_[^g_,^g_]=12^+_^3x(^g_)+12 ^ -_^3x(^g _ ) , each being defined with respect to a two - dimensional urbantke - like metric @xcite @xmath57 ( in the sense that it is constructed with the @xmath0 field ) . in this expression",
    ", @xmath58 denotes the sign of @xmath59 ( we refer the reader to appendix [ appdet ] for the calculation of @xmath58 ) .    in the gravitational and topological sectors ,",
    "the self - dual and anti self - dual components of the @xmath0 field are given by :    [ selfdual bg ] +  [ selfdual bt ]    * gravitational sector : @xmath60 , * topological sector : @xmath61 .",
    "in each of these two sectors , we can now compute the two urbantke metrics @xmath62 defined by the expressions above .",
    "in fact , from the simplicity constraints , we know already that @xmath63 .",
    "it is however less trivial to see that the metrics in the topological and gravitational sector are identical .",
    "a simple calculation shows that we have [ urbantke metrics ] ^g_=^g_g_=(e_e_)(^2+(^0)^2)-(e_)(e_)+^2e^0_e^0_-^0(e^0_e_+e^0_e _ ) , where @xmath64 . in the time gauge ,",
    "this metric reduces to @xmath65 .    gathering these results on the urbantke metric and the sign factors @xmath58",
    ", we can conclude that the action ( [ bf action ] ) reduces in the gravitational sector to s_[g_]=_^3x(g _ ) , while in the topological sector it becomes simply @xmath66=0 $ ] .",
    "this shows that the gravitational sector to the solutions of the simplicity constraints @xmath13 corresponds indeed to three - dimensional gravity , whereas in the topological sector the action vanishes on - shell .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the four - dimensional plebanski theory .",
    "interestingly , the presence of a topological sector in this three - dimensional theory allows for the introduction of a barbero - immirzi parameter , but we shall come back to this point in section [ sec3 ] .      in this subsection",
    "we perform the canonical analysis of the three - dimensional @xmath11 plebanski theory .",
    "it is similar to the study of the four - dimensional plebanski action @xcite .",
    "using a @xmath8 decomposition of the spacetime manifold , ( [ 3d plebanski ] ) becomes s_[b , , ] = _ t_^2x(-^ab(b_a,_0_b ) + 12^ab(b_0,f_ab ) + ^ab(_0,t_ab ) + 12^(b_,b _ ) ) , where the curvature and torsion two - forms are defined by for convenience .",

    "[ curvature ] ^abf_ab=^ab(_a_b-_b_a+[_a,_b]),^abt_ab=^ab(_ab_b+[_a , b_b ] ) .",
    "we can see from this formula for the action that @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath31 are non - dynamical variables , since the lagrangian does not feature their time derivatives .",
    "the time component @xmath68 of the connection and @xmath31 are true lagrange multipliers , enforcing respectively the torsion - free and simplicity constraints . however , since @xmath69 is involved quadratically in the simplicity constraint , it can not be treated as a lagrange multiplier . for this reason ,",
    "we add to the lagrangian the term ( _ 0,_0b_0)+(_0,_0 ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are new auxiliary @xmath11-valued fields that do not affect the dynamics of the theory .",
    "the basic variables of the theory are then the 12 spatial components @xmath72 of the connection , their 12 canonical momenta @xmath73 , and the 6 components @xmath74 with their momenta @xmath75 . the poisson structure is given by [ phase space ] b_a^ij(x),_b^kl(y)=-^ij , kl_ab^2(x - y),b_0^ij(x),_0^kl(y)=^ij , kl^2(x - y ) , where @xmath76 . the total hamiltonian is [ hamiltonian ] h=-_^2x(12^ab(b_0,f_ab ) + ^ab(_0,t_ab ) + 12^(b_,b _ ) + ( _ 0,_0 ) ) .",
    "we can now identify the primary constraints and compute their poisson bracket with this hamiltonian in order to study their evolution in time .",
    "we have the following 18 primary constraints : _",
    "= ( b_,b_)0,t_ab0,_00 .",
    "the first set is obtained by varying the action with respect to @xmath31 , the second set by varying the action with respect to @xmath68 , and the third one by varying with respect to @xmath71    before going any further , let us introduce smeared variables in order to deal with the delta functions appearing in the poisson brackets . to this end , we define the quantities t(u)=_^2x^ab(u , t_ab),f(u)=_^2x^ab(u , f_ab ) , for any @xmath11-valued smooth test function @xmath77 on @xmath78 .",
    "this enables us to compute f(u),f(v)=0,t(u),t(v)=-t([u , v]),t(u),f(v)=-f([u , v ] ) , and t(u),b_a=[u , b_a],t(u),_a=-_au , f(u),b_a=-2_au , f(u),_a=0 , where @xmath79 stands for the covariant derivative with respect to the connection @xmath80 .",
    "now we can compute the poisson bracket of the primary constraints with the total hamiltonian , to see if the requirement that they be preserved under the time evolution gives rise to secondary constraints .",
    "first , it is easy to show that the conservation of @xmath81 does not lead to any secondary constraints . to see this",
    ", we can introduce the new constraint [ so(4 ) generator ] g(u)t(u)-_^2x(u,[b_0,_0 ] ) , and notice that it is in fact the generator of the infinitesimal @xmath11 gauge transformations on the phase space .",
    "indeed , on the action of @xmath82 on the phase space variables ( [ phase space ] ) is given by g(u),b_=[u , b_],g(u),_a=-_au . since the hamiltonian contains only terms with traces , it is left invariant under the action of this constraint , which therefore satisfies @xmath83 . the modification ( [ so(4 ) generator ] ) of the constraint is permissible since it amounts to adding a term which is itself proportional to a constraint .",
    "the requirement that the primary constraint @xmath70 be preserved in time leads to the following relation : _ 0=h,_0=-12^abf_ab-^0ab_a-^00b_00 . among these 6 equations ,",
    "3 are in fact fixing the components @xmath84 ( if we assume that the non - degeneracy condition holds ) , and the remaining 3 have to be imposed as secondary constraints . projecting onto the vector @xmath85 , these secondary constraints can be written as _",
    "^ab(f_ab , b_)0 .",
    "to study the evolution of the simplicity constraint , it is convenient to compute separately the poisson bracket of its various components with the hamiltonian .",
    "requiring that the constraints @xmath87 and @xmath88 be preserved under time evolution leads to    [ fixation ] & & _ 00=-2(_0,b_0)0 , + & & _ 0a=(b_0,_ab_0)+(b_0,[b_a,_0])-(_0,b_a)0 .",
    "these 3 equations determine 3 of the 6 components of the multiplier @xmath71 , and imply no secondary constraints on the dynamical variables of the phase space .",
    "finally , a direct computation shows that the requirement that @xmath89 leads to the 3 secondary constraints [ ssc ] _",
    "the dirac algorithm stops here , and there are no tertiary constraints .",
    "to summarize , we have a theory with 18 primary constraints consisting of 6 constraints @xmath70 , 6 constraints @xmath81 , and 6 constraints",
    "they generate the 6 secondary constraints comprising the 3 constraints @xmath90 and the 3 constraints @xmath91 .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "we have derived the primary and secondary constraints of the plebanski theory .",

    "it is well known that it has no effects at the classical level ( see @xcite for a discussion about its controversial fate in the presence of fermions ) , since it drops out of the equations of motion by means of the bianchi identities . however , in the quantum theory , it appears explicitly in the spectra of the geometric operators @xcite such as area and volume , and in the formula for the entropy of black holes @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the presence of this quantization ambiguity at the quantum level might be related to a `` wrong '' choice of the connection parametrizing the phase space at the classical level @xcite .    in the context of four - dimensional spin foam models ,",
    "the inclusion of the barbero - immirzi parameter has been made possible with the introduction of the eprl and fk models .",
    "this has opened the possibility of relating the boundary states of spin foam models with the kinematical states of loop quantum gravity .",
    "however , several points still lack a clear explanation .",
    "in particular , the structure of the models seem to depend on the particular values taken by @xmath189 . for @xmath190 ,",
    "the eprl and fk models do coincide @xcite , and the space of boundary states can be reduced to the space of @xmath1 spin networks . for @xmath191",
    "however , the two models are different , and even if the boundary states of the eprl model coincide with the states of canonical loop quantum gravity , the space of boundary states of the fk model seems to be bigger .",
    "since we have given in this work a proposal for a rigorous implementation of the spin foam quantization procedure in the three - dimensional context , we believe that it should be possible and interesting to investigate the issues arising in the presence of the barbero - immirzi parameter . in usual three - dimensional @xmath1",
    "riemannian gravity , such an extension of the classical theory is not possible , since there is only a unique ( invariant non - degenerate ) bilinear form on @xmath127 .",
    "for this reason , previous attempts to introduce a barbero - immirzi - like parameter were relying on the chern - simons formulation of @xmath9 theory with @xmath192 , in which case there is another bilinear form available @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mimic what happens in the four - dimensional theory , and renders difficult the comparison between the two situations .",
    "since the three - dimensional plebanski theory ( [ 3d plebanski ] ) is formulated for the gauge group @xmath11 , it can be generalized in a natural way to the case @xmath193 . indeed ,",
    "since there are two traces , denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath194 , available on @xmath16 , it is possible to define two different pairings of elements of @xmath16 , and to construct the modified action s_[b , ] = _ ^3x^((b_,f_)+1(b_,f _ ) ) , where @xmath195 . to see that @xmath189 is the analogue of the four - dimensional barbero - immirzi parameter , and in particular that it disappears on - shell ,",
    "let us split the @xmath0 field into its self - dual and anti self - dual components , and write the action as s_[b,]=(1 + 1)^s_+(1 - 1)^s _ , where ^s_[^b,^]_^3x^(^b_,^f _ ) .",
    "following what we have done in section [ sec1 ] , it is possible to solve the torsion - free condition ( if @xmath196 is invertible ) , and to plug back the solution for the connection in the action @xmath197 in order to obtain the second order einstein - hilbert action ^+(1 + 1)s_[^g_]+^-(1 - 1)s_[^g _ ] . if we impose that @xmath17 be simple ( i.e. if we choose the gravitational sector of solutions to the simplicity constraints ) , we know from ( [ selfdual bg ] ) and ( [ urbantke metrics ] ) that we have @xmath198 and @xmath63 , and therefore it is clear the the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath189 disappears from the classical theory .",
    "this argument shows that it is possible to naturally extend the three - dimensional plebanski action that we have introduced in order to have a non - vanishing barbero - immirzi parameter which behaves classically exactly as in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "the holst - plebanski action s_[b , , ] = 12_^3xcan now be taken as a starting point for the spin foam quantization .",
    "it is clear that @xmath189 plays no role at the classical level , and we can then study its fate in the quantum theory .",
    "it has been claimed in the four - dimensional context that a canonical quantization based on the non - commutative spacetime lorentz - connection leads to a quantum theory independent of @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if @xmath189 can disappear as well in the spin foam quantization , and , if not , to investigate why it is not the case . we think that this question deserves a detailed treatment , and keep it for future work .",
    "we want to stress that this is the first time that a barbero - immirzi parameter is introduced in three - dimensional gravity .",
    "in this work , we have introduced a three - dimensional plebanski action for the gauge group @xmath11 , which is based on the notion of simplicity for one - forms .",
    "this simplicity condition on the @xmath0 field is imposed via quadratic simplicity constraints , which admit , just like in the four - dimensional case , a gravitational , a topological , and a degenerate sector of solutions .",
    "we have shown at the classical level that the action reduces to the einstein - hilbert action in the gravitational sector , while in the topological sector the theory is trivial .",
    "the canonical analysis reveals that the theory is indeed equivalent to three - dimensional gravity .",
    "interestingly , this model has a hamiltonian structure similar to that of the four - dimensional plebanski theory , and in particular features secondary second class constraints arising from the stabilization of the primary simplicity constraints .",
    "this three - dimensional plebanski action allows to test the imposition of the simplicity constraints in the spin foam quantization of gravity .",
    "we show that neither the bc nor the eprl prescriptions lead to the expected vertex amplitude , which is that of the ponzano - regge model . however , the two schemes differ drastically in that only the eprl model can give the proper amplitude when it is supplemented with the imposition of the secondary second class constraints .",
    "this suggests that the weak imposition of the simplicity constraints is an essential ingredient in the spin foam quantization , but that it is not sufficient in this three - dimensional model .",
    "we have given a concrete realization of the idea that imposing the secondary second class constraints is a missing element of the spin foam approach @xcite .",
    "a limitation of the present model is that , because of its three - dimensional nature , it has trivial off - diagonal simplicity constraints , and therefore the bc and eprl prescriptions lead to the same vertex amplitude ( up to a normalization factor ) .",
    "this is a key difference with the four - dimensional case , where the off - diagonal simplicity constraints are non - trivial , and might very well encode the information about the secondary second class constraints . in order to investigate this possibility",
    ", it would be interesting to extend the present three - dimensional model to an arbitrary non - simplicial cellular decomposition .",
    "interestingly , the three - dimensional @xmath11 plebanski action allows for the introduction of a barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "this could be a good starting point to understand and test issues related to the role of the barbero - immirzi parameter in the canonical and spin foam quantizations @xcite .    finally , let us conclude with a remark on the bc model . in the present work ,",
    "we have followed only one very specific way to derive the bc model , which is the most straightforward one .",
    "there are however in the literature more rigorous and transparent approaches which lead to variants of the usual four - dimensional bc model , and which allow to overcome some of the criticism which were originally raised against the model and to clarify its geometrical meaning .",
    "details about these constructions can be found in the work of bonzom and livine @xcite and baratin and oriti @xcite . in this latter in particular , the authors use a non - commutative metric representation of group field theory to define a model of four - dimensional constrained @xmath9 theory , whose amplitudes reproduce a variant of that of the bc model . in this approach , it is shown that any spin foam model for constrained @xmath9 theory can be written as a simplicial path integral featuring an explicit non - trivial measure over the holonomies and the bivectors . the measure over the holonomies is naturally interpreted as imposing secondary constraints arising from the consistent imposition in each tetrahedron frame of the ( primary ) linear simplicity constraints .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to investigate wether these secondary constraints agree with those coming from the canonical analysis , and to test the proposal of @xcite on the present toy model to see if it leads to the ponzano - regge amplitudes .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank alejandro perez for useful comments , discussions , and enthusiasm .",
    "we also would like to thank sergei alexandrov and simone speziale for reading an earlier version of this work , and pointing out interesting remarks .",
    "finally , we thank aristide baratin for discussions about group field theory .",
    "in this work , notations are such that @xmath199 refer to spacetime indices , @xmath200 to spatial indices , @xmath201 to @xmath16 indices , and @xmath202 to @xmath127 indices .",
    "we assume that the three - dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath128 is topologically @xmath203 , where @xmath78 is a two - dimensional manifold without boundaries .",
    "we use the notation @xmath204 for vectors in @xmath22 with components @xmath205 , the wedge product between elements @xmath206 ( zero - forms or one - forms ) to denote the operation @xmath207 , and the dot product for @xmath208 . we often denote the vectors @xmath209 simply by @xmath210 .",
    "@xmath16 is the real lie algebra of the isometry group @xmath11 of the quadratic form @xmath212 .",
    "we use capital latin letters for internal vector indices and define the antisymmetric tensor @xmath213 such that @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the indices are lowered and raised with the metric @xmath216 .",
    "the action of the hodge dual operator is defined by j^ij=12^ij _",
    "klj^kl , and it satisfies @xmath217 .",
    "one of the basis of @xmath16 , composed of rotation generators @xmath218 and boost generators @xmath219 , with @xmath220 , has the following commutation relations : = _ ij^  kl_k,=_ij^  kl_k,=_ij^  kk_k , where @xmath221 .",
    "starting from this basis of @xmath16 , it is convenient to define a new basis @xmath222 as ^j_i=12(l_ik_i ) , whose generators realize two commuting copies of @xmath127 , i.e. satisfy = _ ij^  k^j_k,=0 . for any element @xmath223 , we have the decomposition @xmath224 into self - dual and anti self - dual components , where @xmath225 . the action of the hodge dual operator on the ( anti ) self - dual components if given by ^=^. finally , the vector representation of @xmath16 is given by ^j^ij_i=12(-^0iij^ii^0j^0i^ij ) .",
    "in this appendix , we compute the sign @xmath58 of @xmath59 in the gravitational and topological sectors .      in the gravitational sector , we have @xmath158 , and the boost and rotational components of @xmath17 are given respectively by k^i_b^0i_=(e_)^i , l^i_12^i _",
    "jkb^jk_=^0e^i_-^ie^0_. therefore , we have the relation k^i_=_0 ^ -1(l_)^i , and the self - dual and anti self - dual components ( [ selfdual bg ] ) of the @xmath0 field can be written as [ bdecompositiong ] ^b^i_=(e_)^i+(^ie^0_-^0e^i_)=k^i_-l^i_=(-_0 ^ -1)l^i_. here we have introduced the three - dimensional matrix =    0 & -_3 & _ 2 + _ 3 & 0 & -_1 + -_2 & _ 1 & 0    associated to @xmath44 such that @xmath227 for any @xmath228 , and @xmath229 denotes the three - dimensional unit matrix . with this notation , we can compute from ( [ bdecompositiong ] ) the determinant ( ^b)=(-_0 ^ -1)(l^i_)=-(1+_0 ^ -2(_1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2+_3 ^ 2))(l^i _ ) .",
    "therefore , we see that in the gravitational sector we have @xmath198 .      in the topological sector , we have @xmath230 , and the boost and rotational components of @xmath17 are given respectively by k^i_=^0e^i_-^ie^0 _",
