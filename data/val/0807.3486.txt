    "the phenomenon of confinement is usually thought of as originating in the yang - mills sector of qcd . in the quenched theory with heavy sources confinement thus understood manifests itself in the behaviour of the wilson loop at large distances ; here an area law is associated with flux - tube formation of colour - electric fields and a linear rising potential for heavy quarks . in the full theory , however , the colour - electric string between these charges breaks due to the creation of light quark - antiquark pairs . therefore the potential is no longer rising but levels out at large distances .",
    "thus in a sense , made precise _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite , full qcd is not confining .",
    "nevertheless , free colour - charges are absent in the real world and the precise mechanism for this absence has to be determined in full qcd with realistic quark masses .",
    "this so - called colour - confinement mechanism is still elusive even after three decades of intense efforts . in a series of ( partly unfinished ) papers @xcite gribov developed a scenario of quark confinement arising from the supercriticality of colour charges .",
    "the basic idea , summarised in @xcite , is the binding of quarks with positive kinetic energy within a bound state of total negative energy . in order to guarantee a stable vacuum",
    "these states have to be filled up , therefore enforcing a vacuum with occupied quark states of positive kinetic energy in addition to the negative energy quark states of the conventional dirac sea .",
    "consequently , the pauli principle prevents single quarks from propagating and there can be no corresponding asymptotic states of single quarks .    according to gribov @xcite , an essential ingredient in this picture is the appearance of goldstone bosons due to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the goldstone bosons , identified with the pseudoscalar pions , he conjectured to change the analytical structure of the quark propagator in such a way that the resulting quarks are confined by the supercritical mechanism .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to critically investigate the actual influence of goldstone bosons on this structure .    to this end",
    "we employ a truncation scheme for the quark dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) and the quark - gluon vertex dse developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which leads to a quark self - energy governed by non - perturbative gluon and pion exchange .",
    "the structure of the resulting dse for the quark propagator is similar to the equation gribov started with originally .",
    "in contrast to gribov , we work with the dses as coupled integral equations rather than their  in principal equivalent  differential formulation that he favoured for analytical studies .",
    "however , in converting an integral equation into a tractable differential equation many approximations must be employed .",
    "instead we work directly with the integral equation and apply a truncation scheme that contains the same features implemented by gribov , which has been used as a basis for hadron phenomenology and comparisons to lattice qcd results . in this truncation scheme",
    "we obtain information on the analytic structure of the quark propagator with and without pion back - reaction by a combination of several methods . as a result",
    "we find no evidence in favour of gribov s conjecture .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section two",
    "we outline our truncation for the gluonic part of the quark - dse , together with our approximation scheme for the hadronic part of the vertex , following the procedure of  @xcite .",
    "we specify our method for exploring the analytic structure of the quark - propagator in the complex plane , leaving details of the implementation to appendix  [ complexplane ] . in section three",
    "we present our numerical results , and finally give our conclusions .",
    "the full dyson - schwinger equation for the quark propagator is displayed diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dse1 ] .    with the dressed inverse quark propagator @xmath0 and its bare counterpart @xmath1 the equation is given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 , the casimir @xmath4 and the renormalization factors @xmath5 of the quark gluon vertex and @xmath6 of the quark propagator .",
    "in the course of this work we will consider the case @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the vector and scalar dressing functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be recombined into the quark mass @xmath11 and the quark wave - function @xmath12 .",
    "the dressing functions depend on the fully dressed quark - gluon vertex @xmath13 and the gluon propagator @xmath14 with the gluon dressing function @xmath15 .",
    "up to , for our purposes minor , details in the far infrared the function @xmath15 is well known from both lattice calculations and dyson - schwinger equations ( for a review see _",
    "@xcite ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we will work in the landau gauge as opposed to the choice of feynman gauge gribov adopted in his work .",
    "we expect that if the physical mechanism for quark confinement is triggered by the back - coupling of goldstone bosons to the quarks this mechanism should be present in all continuously connected gauges .",
    "we prefer landau gauge over feynman gauge because the gluon dressing function is well known there ( see below ) and the tensor structure of the propagator is particularly simple , where @xmath16 is the gauge parameter and @xmath17 for feynman gauge . due to an exact slavnov - taylor identity",
    "the longitudinal part of this propagator remains undressed . only for a nonlinear gauge condition",
    "can the propagator be rewritten as @xmath18 @xcite , where the choice of the running coupling as the dressing function is insprired from the abelian theory . in the non - abelian case",
    "such a choice already represents a combination of dressings for the gluon propagator and the quark - gluon vertex . ] .    the other input into eq .",
    "( [ dse1 ] ) is the fully dressed quark - gluon vertex @xmath13 .",
    "an approximation for the vertex in terms of the quark self - energies and the dressing function @xmath19 of the propagator of faddeev - popov ghosts has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the ansatz @xmath20 with @xmath21 \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace*{3.5 cm } \\times    \\frac{p^2+q^2}{(p^2-q^2)^2+(m^2(p^2)+m^2(q^2))^2 } \\ ; ,    \\label{cp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ghost wave - function renormalisation @xmath22 has been shown to lead to a quark - dse which has the correct ultraviolet asymptotic limit and respects multiplicative renormalisability .",
    "in addition , the abelian part @xmath23 of the construction is identical with the so - called curtis - pennington vertex @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "its first three terms have been shown by ball and chiu @xcite to satisfy the abelian ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) , @xmath25 with the quark momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the gluon momentum @xmath28 . as found in @xcite ,",
    "the presence or absence of the scalar interaction term proportional to @xmath29 is of particular importance for the analytical structure of the quark propagator . in section [ results ]",
    "we therefore contrast results obtained with the ansatz ( [ cp ] ) also with the simpler vertex @xmath30 which does not contain the scalar interaction term .",
    "since the approximation ( [ 1bc ] ) consists of only the first term of the ball - chiu solution of the wti we will refer to it as ` 1bc - vertex ' .",
    "it represents a form of the rainbow - ladder approximation of the quark - dse which has been successfully applied to the physics of light mesons @xcite .",
    "we wish to emphasize , that the ansatz ( [ vertex ] ) for the quark - gluon vertex has similar properties as a recent explicit solution of the quark - gluon vertex dse @xcite .",
    "in particular the infrared singularity @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xcite present in all tensor structures of the vertex is also an approximate property of the explicit solution which is proportional to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we need to keep in mind , however , that the relative strength of the different tensor structures in the full vertex may not be represented well by the curtis - pennington part ( [ cp ] ) of our vertex ansatz . this will play an important part in our discussion of the analytical properties of the quark propagator at the end of section [ complexresults ] .    in the quark - dse the combination of the ghost dressing functions from the non - abelian part of the vertex and the dressing function from the gluon propagator can be recombined to form the strong running coupling in a @xmath34-scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ defined from the ghost - gluon vertex : @xmath35 the dyson - schwinger equation for the quark propagator then reads @xmath36 this equation , first developed in @xcite , is quite similar to the integral equation gribov derived his differential equation from .",
    "the quark - gluon interaction is basically given by the strong running coupling and the dressed vertex is chosen such that it satisfies the abelian version of the slavnov - taylor identity .",
    "note , however , that the present approximation is more sophisticated compared to the one of gribov with respect to two points .",
    "first , the coupling under the integral is momentum dependent , whereas gribov approximated even further by replacing @xmath37 . as a consequence we find the correct leading order anomalous dimensions for the quark dressing functions in the uv .",
    "second , the abelian part of the vertex nevertheless satisfies the full wti as opposed to gribov s version which satisfied only the differential form of the wti valid for zero gluon momentum .",
    "for these reasons we believe that the approximation ( [ dse2 ] ) is more accurate than the version of gribov .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath15 used in this work has been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by a fit to numerical solutions of the coupled system of dses for the ghost and gluon propagators .",
    "it is given by @xmath38 with the gluon momentum @xmath39 , the one - loop value @xmath40 for the anomalous dimension of the re - summed gluon propagator and @xmath41 at the renormalisation scale @xmath42  gev@xmath43 .",
    "we use @xmath44  gev@xmath43 similar to the scale obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . the infrared exponent",
    "@xmath45 has been determined analytically in @xcite and is given by @xmath46 .",
    "the running coupling @xmath47 is parameterised such that the numerical results for euclidean scales are accurately reproduced @xcite : @xmath48 here @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the fixed point in the infrared , calculated to be @xmath51 for our choice of @xmath45 .",
    "note that such a fixed point has also been found for the couplings from the three - gluon and four - gluon vertices @xcite .",
    "the expressions ( [ gluondress ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) represent solutions of the yang - mills part of qcd with important properties .",
    "first , note the analytic structure of the gluon dressing function ( [ gluondress ] ) produces a cut along the entire timelike @xmath39-axis representing the possibility of the gluon to decay into ghost - antighost pairs and also into gluons .",
    "however , these particles are not physical and need to be confined .",
    "for the gluon dressing function this is reflected in its spectral properties which have been determined in @xcite : the gluon has a positive spectral function for scales below approximately one fermi , whereas it is negative for larger scales . as a result",
    "the gluon appears to be a free particle in perturbation theory whereas it can not propagate freely at larger scales .",
    "the resulting running coupling ( [ alpha ] ) has an analytic structure similar to the one anticipated from analytic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , it displays an infrared fixed point .",
    "thus in contrast to the setup of gribov , where this infrared fixed point behaviour had to be assumed , we are in a position to use an explicitly calculated coupling with the same property .",
    "note , however , that this is only possible due to our choice for the quark - gluon vertices ( [ cp ] ) and ( [ 1bc ] ) . as mentioned above the explicit solution for this vertex given in @xcite is slightly less singular than our ansatz . using the model of @xcite , which reproduces this behaviour ,",
    "we have checked that this difference has no qualitative impact on most of our results with the exception of those reported in section [ dsol ] , where we will comment further .      as stated in the introduction",
    ", gribov argued that the effects of the back - reaction by the goldstone bosons on the quarks should be crucial to generate colour - confinement @xcite . to this end",
    "he determined a form of the pion back - reaction that couples the pion directly to the quark .",
    "this can be displayed diagrammatically as done in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse2 ] .    a similar expression for the pion",
    "back - reaction has been derived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "here we develop a modified approximation scheme leading to a slightly different interaction .",
    "consider the dyson - schwinger equation of the fully dressed quark - gluon vertex , given in the first line of fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexdse ] .",
    "for very small momenta , a self - consistent solution to this equation has been given in ref .",
    "here we are primarily interested in the mid - momentum behavior of the vertex and in particular in hadronic contributions .",
    "to lowest order in a skeleton expansion such contributions can only occur in the diagram with the bare quark - gluon vertex at the external gluon line . in the second line of fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexdse ] we expand the quark - antiquark scattering amplitude of this diagram in terms of resonance contributions to the kernel and one - particle irreducible green s functions .",
    "amongst other terms discussed in @xcite one finds one - meson exchange between the quark and anti - quark lines .",
    "of all the hadronic contributions this term should be dominant , since diagrams involving heavier mesons and baryons are suppressed by factors of @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "plugging the resulting approximation for the quark - gluon vertex into the quark - dse one arrives at the diagrammatic expression shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] . here",
    "the part denoted by the subscript ` ym ' denotes contributions of a purely gluonic nature .",
    "this yang - mills part of the interaction has been specified in the previous subsection .",
    "the pion - part is quite complicated , since it involves not only two - loop integrals but also the full pion bethe - salpeter vertex which needs to be determined from a bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we will further simplify this expression by noting that one of the loops involves two bare quark - gluon vertices and a dressed gluon propagator .",
    "the latter one is suppressed at large momenta and at most constant if not vanishing in the infrared ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we have approximated this loop by the bethe - salpeter vertex , which would be justified if the full quark - gluon vertex is almost bare .",
    "however this leads to an over - estimation of the back - reaction and we therefore only assume it to be proportional to @xmath54 here .",
    "indeed , a good agreement with lattice qcd results for the quark propagator and also meson phenomenology  @xcite is obtained by setting the loop to be equal to @xmath54 .",
    "we have checked that the qualitative conclusions drawn in this paper do not change when employing the truncation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is actually more similar to gribov s approach .",
    "one then arrives at the approximated quark - dse displayed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] .    both , gluon and pion exchange are now given by a one - loop diagram with one dressed and one bare vertex , respectively . compared to the previous work of ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse2 ] , one of the dressed pion - quark vertices has disappeared . as an effect , the pion back - reaction onto the quark is somewhat reduced .",
    "this is in line with the results of @xcite , where it has been found that the interaction of fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse2 ] leads to far too strong back - reaction effects which finally resulted in a dramatically small pion decay constant .",
    "furthermore , our new approximation removes potential problems with double counting vertex contributions , which are generically present in dses with all vertices dressed . for the purpose of the present paper we will use the approximation of fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] , though we also performed calculations with both pion - quark vertices dressed .    in principle , the pion in the loop couples to the quark line with its full bethe - salpeter vertex function at the dressed vertex . in general",
    "this function can be decomposed into four different tensor structures @xmath55 \\,h_\\pi(p , p ) \\right\\}\\ , , \\label{pion}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 denotes the flavour structure of the vertex , @xmath27 is the relative and @xmath57 the total momentum of the bound state .",
    "this pion bound state is the pole contribution of the full pseudoscalar vertex function . in the chiral limit",
    "an exact solution for the functions @xmath58 in terms of the quark self energies and regular parts of the isovector axial - vector vertex has been given in @xcite .",
    "for the leading part @xmath59 of the vertex the solution in the chiral limit depends on the scalar part @xmath10 of the quark propagator and the pion decay constant @xmath60 and is given by @xmath61 such that the pion vertex in this approximation reads @xmath62 for the given truncation scheme two of us have checked explicitly that this expression is also a very good approximation to the full amplitude @xmath59 for a pion with realistic mass , see the appendix of ref .",
    "we therefore use ( [ piapprox ] ) for the pion vertex in the second diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] .",
    "the resulting complete quark - dse then reads @xmath63 with @xmath28 and a factor of three in the pion interaction part due to the flavour factors .",
    "the pion part of the quark - dse can now be compared with the one gribov suggested in ref .",
    "there are two differences .",
    "the first one concerns the appearance of two dressed pion - quark vertices in the back - reaction diagram considered by gribov , whereas our approximation only includes one dressed vertex for reasons discussed above .",
    "the second concerns the form of the pion bethe - salpeter amplitude . here",
    "gribov considered the form @xmath64 which involves further structure in the pion amplitude besides the leading @xmath65-part considered in eq .",
    "( [ piapprox ] ) .",
    "unfortunately these additional terms are proportional to the quark dressing function @xmath9 and therefore have the wrong asymptotics at large momenta as compared to actual solutions of the pion bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "finally we need to specify the values of the pion mass @xmath66 and decay constant @xmath60 for the pion propagator in the dses . in the chiral limit",
    "the pion is a goldstone boson and @xmath67 mev .",
    "we use this value together with @xmath68 mev . away from the chiral",
    "limit we use the physical values @xmath69 mev and @xmath70 mev for simplicity .",
    "we explicitly checked that the qualitative features of all our results do not depend on variations of these numbers .",
    "the quantitative effects are very small .",
    "before we solve equation ( [ dse3 ] ) we have to specify our renormalisation procedure . upon multiplying ( [ dse3 ] ) with @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "respectively and taking the dirac trace , one projects the equation onto the self - energies @xmath10 and @xmath9 contained in the fully dressed quark propagator @xmath73 .",
    "schematically one obtains @xmath74 where we have made the dependence on the renormalisation point @xmath75 explicit .",
    "the renormalisation factor @xmath6 is then determined by evaluating the second equation at the renormalisation point , _ i.e. _ @xmath76 with the renormalisation condition @xmath77 . in a numerical iterative procedure",
    "this is always the first step at every iteration step .",
    "furthermore , away from the chiral limit @xmath78 one can eliminate the renormalisation point independent mass parameter @xmath79 by subtracting ( [ b ] ) at the renormalisation point .",
    "this results in @xmath80 with the input mass @xmath81 at the renormalisation point @xmath75 .",
    "the behaviour of the quark propagator in the complex momentum plane and the associated analytic structure of the propagator can be investigated in two ways .",
    "one possibility is to read off the analytic structure from the corresponding schwinger function @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the scalar and the vector parts , respectively , of the dressed quark propagator , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this method has a long history , see @xcite and references therein . according to the osterwalder - schrader axioms of euclidean field theory @xcite",
    ", the function @xmath86 has to be positive to allow for asymptotic quark states in the physical sector of the state space of qcd .",
    "conversely , positivity violations in the schwinger function show that the corresponding asymptotic states ( if present ) belong to the unphysical part of the state space .",
    "thus positivity violations constitute a sufficient condition for confinement . moreover , by fitting @xmath86 with appropriate forms one obtains information on the dominant ( _ i.e. _ closest to the origin ) non - analyticity of the quark propagator in the complex plane . in this work we use the form @xmath87 which corresponds to a pair of complex conjugate poles of the propagator in the timelike momentum plane located at @xmath88 .",
    "the schwinger function is then oscillating around zero with periodicity @xmath89 . if @xmath90 one obtains an exponentially damped schwinger function corresponding to a pole on the real negative momentum axis at @xmath91 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "thus by calculating the schwinger function once with and once without the pion back - reaction we have a reliable tool to assess possible changes in the analytical structure of the quark propagator .",
    "this allows us to test gribov s conjecture .",
    "these findings can be further corroborated by a direct calculation of the quark propagator in the complex plane .",
    "technically , however , there is a caveat . consider _",
    "e.g. _ the explicit form of the dse for the scalar self - energy @xmath10 using the 1bc - vertex defined in eq .",
    "( [ 1bc ] ) : @xmath92 a similar equation holds for @xmath9 .",
    "solving this equation directly at complex momenta @xmath93 entails a complex argument @xmath94 of the running coupling @xmath95 .",
    "this coupling , however , has its own analytic structure , given by eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "although ( [ alpha ] ) represents a reasonably motivated and justified guess for the analytic structure of the coupling we would rather avoid relying upon it .",
    "fortunately it turns out that this can be easily accomplished . to this end",
    "we shift the loop momentum @xmath96 in the quark - dse such that the complex argument @xmath39 does not appear in the gluon part of the loop but instead runs through the internal quark part of the loop . for the shifted equation",
    "we obtain @xmath97 and a similarly shifted equation for @xmath9 .",
    "the running coupling is now evaluated for real momenta @xmath96 only , whereas the quark propagator is determined self - consistently for complex momenta @xmath93 and @xmath39 .",
    "the only caveat in this procedure is the interference with the regularisation procedure .",
    "obviously , if we employ a translationary invariant regularisation scheme such as dimensional regularisation such a shift would be harmless . in our numerical procedure , however , we use a hard cut - off scheme .",
    "then it turns out , that the unshifted and shifted coupled system of quark - dses for @xmath98 and @xmath99 precisely give the same results , if @xmath6 is kept fixed while shifting . in practise we calculate @xmath100 for a given renormalisation point @xmath75 from the fully converged unshifted equations and plug its value into the shifted equations as an input parameter .",
    "both results then agree to numerical accuracy on the real axis .",
    "we then use the shifted dses to solve for @xmath10 and @xmath9 in the complex plane . here",
    "we developed a new numerical algorithm , which is described in detail in appendix [ complexplane ] .",
    "we first compare the quark mass function @xmath101 and the wave function @xmath102 with and without the pion back - coupling for real momenta @xmath93 .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ quark ] . in the upper panel",
    "we compare results for the simpler 1bc - vertex ( [ 1bc ] ) , whereas in the lower panel results for the full curtis - pennington construction ( [ cp ] ) are shown . in both cases",

    "( [ 1bc ] ) we obtain an oscillating schwinger function . in the plot",
    "this oscillation is manifest in the vertical spikes .",
    "an ansatz representing a pair of complex conjugate poles in the momentum plane fits such a behaviour nicely and one obtains the pole locations reported in table [ table ] .",
    "all imaginary parts are clearly significant and have roughly half the size of the real parts of @xmath106 .",
    "the inclusion of the pion back - reaction here diminishes the real parts by about 20 mev and the imaginary parts by a somewhat smaller 10 mev .",
    "the situation is totally different when the vertex construction ( [ cp ] ) including the curtis - pennington ansatz is used .",
    "the relative strengths of the different tensor structures of the vertex are now such that the abelian wti is satisfied . from the right diagram in fig .",
    "[ ft ] we see that the resulting schwinger function now decays exponentially without any visible oscillations .",
    "such a behaviour is characteristic for a quark propagator with a singularity on the real axis which may or may not be accompanied by a cut .",
    "the location of this singularity is also reported in table [ table ] .",
    "again the inclusion of the pion back - reaction does not change the qualitative behaviour of the schwinger function but merely shifts the location of the singularity by 20 - 30 mev to lower values .",
    "this is the central result of this work : the inclusion of the pion back - reaction does not change the analytical structure of the quark propagator . instead , as has been discussed previously in @xcite , it is the relative strength of the scalar and vector terms in the yang - mills part of the quark - gluon interaction which is crucial .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we can interpret this result .",
    "consider for a moment the abelian theory , _",
    "i.e. _ qed . the non - abelian part @xmath128 of the vertex is then absent and the abelian wti ( [ wti ] ) exact .",
    "gauge invariance then dictates a form of the fermion - photon vertex like the curtis - pennington construction .",
    "the resulting physical electron propagator then is expected to have a singularity at the electron mass accompanied by a cut due to the accompanying soft photon cloud .",
    "this agrees well with our findings .",
    "the quark - gluon vertex in the non - abelian theory , however , is necessarily modified compared to the abelian interaction .",
    "this can be seen from its slavnov - taylor identity @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the dressing function of the faddeev - popov ghosts and @xmath131 the ghost - quark scattering kernel .",
    "it is currently not clear , though a matter of current investigations @xcite whether these modifications lead to either of the singularity structures displayed in fig .",
    "the answer to this question remains important , since oscillations in the schwinger function would be a sufficient condition for quark confinement as discussed in subsection [ complex ] .",
    "for sufficiently strong coupling multiple solutions of the quark - dse exist in a domain @xmath132 of the current quark - mass  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of multiple solutions is not surprising and has strong similarities with hysteresis in ferromagnets . in",
    "his work gribov emphasized however that his equations for a supercritical coupling allow for presumably infinite different solutions in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the finding in dse investigations using the maris - tandy model  @xcite .",
    "here we explore these multiple solutions without the inclusion of the pion back - reaction , indicating that the different behaviour of these multiple solutions is a result of the truncation scheme employed and the form of the gluon interaction .",
    "all of these multiple solutions are connected to the perturbative running of quark mass at large momenta , differing only in their infrared behaviour .",
    "they can be distinguished by the number of zero crossings that occur in the quark self - energy @xmath99 , or equivalently in the mass function @xmath133 .",
    "the energetically preferred or physical solution is strictly positive definite . without explicit symmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. _ in the chiral limit , the symmetric solution without dynamical mass generation has to exist as well .    in fig .",
    "[ othersoln ] and  [ othersoln2 ] we present various properties of the multiple solutions . in fig .",
    "[ othersoln ] we follow the value of the mass function @xmath134 starting with a positive definite solution beyond @xmath135 , denoted ` positive ' in fig",
    ".  [ othersoln ] and marked with a ` i ' .",
    "decreasing the current quark - mass to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ going to the chiral limit , the positive solution is degenerate with a negative solution , whose mass function has the opposite sign .",
    "this is related to a @xmath136 symmetry of the quark - dse when simultaneously sending @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "this symmetry is also manifest in fig .",
    "[ othersoln ] . restricting our attention to @xmath134",

    "the location of the complex poles , as obtained through the schwinger function is shown in the left diagram of fig .",
    "[ othersoln2 ] and reveals that these positive and negative solutions are smoothly connected .",
    "the key difference , however , is that these negative solutions develop a node in the mass function as we cross @xmath78  that is to say they are no longer positive semi - definite with the scalar self - energy changing sign for small ( @xmath139  gev ) momenta . on continuing to increase the magnitude of the negative mass",
    ", we reach a critical point @xmath135 whose model - dependent value here is approximately @xmath140  mev at @xmath141  gev for the 1bc vertex and the interaction described in section [ interaction ] .",
    "this critical mass merely indicates a bifurcation where the negative solution is degenerate with the so - called wigner solution . at this point",
    ", we move again towards the chiral limit , this time following a different path marked by a ` iii ' .",
    "interestingly , the wigner solution does not connect immediately to the trivial solution @xmath142 at @xmath78 .",
    "instead , we find @xmath143 for @xmath78 and therefore a second non - trivial solution in the chiral limit . this behaviour was not observed in previous studies .",
    "] of these solutions  @xcite . there",
    ", extensive use of the maris - tandy  @xcite interaction has been made .",
    "also the soft - divergence model of @xcite constructed to exhibit the infrared properties of the quark - gluon vertex determined in @xcite does not show the second class of non - trivial wigner solutions observed in the right diagram of fig .",
    "[ othersoln ] . both the maris - tandy model and",
    "the soft - divergence model vanish at zero momentum with different powers of momentum squared .",
    "the behaviour of fig .",
    "[ othersoln ] is only present when the quark - gluon vertex is given enough strength leading to either an infrared - fixed point or a singular behaviour in the effective running coupling , as is the case in our interaction and that of gribov s .",
    "this second wigner solution develops a total of two zero - crossings in the mass function as we cross @xmath78 .",
    "increasing the mass , we follow curve ` iv ' , which again bifurcates into two solutions at some second critical mass @xmath144 .",

    "we can only presume that such solutions continue to exist , with yet more nodes developing in the mass - function as the trivial solution is approached .",
    "we expect the multitude of these solutions to smoothly connect the location of the complex poles to the trivial solution , as indicated in the left diagram of fig .",
    "[ othersoln2 ] .    once again , we point out that we did not include pion effects here , due in part to the ambiguity of choosing @xmath145 and @xmath60 for varying quark mass .",
    "since gribov found the same results in his approximation with the pion back - reaction  @xcite , it seems likely that the inclusion of pions does not change this picture quantitatively .",

    "[ fig : cmplxsol ] . for the purposes of demonstration , we employed the 1bc vertex with a small quark mass @xmath154 and include the contribution from the pion back - reaction .    the advantages of employing such an expanding shell method and the associated interpolation scheme becomes apparent when we use our solutions in studies of the bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "not only are we able to provide solutions to the quark - dse in the complex plane for any _ numerically _ determined gluon propagator or quark - gluon vertex  without changing or making assumptions of the analytic structure by use of fit functions  but we can do this quickly and accurately .",
    "indeed , it is gratifying to see that our bound - state solutions change by less than a percent for a wide selection of coarse and fine grids @xcite .",
    "as we expand our parabolas outward into the complex plane , our domain of exploration approaches the location of the complex poles .",
    "close to these poles , the function becomes steep and can not be reliably represented by our interpolation scheme without adaptive modification of the grid points . with such tuning , it is possible to see the onset of conjugate poles in the complex plane by looking for bumps arising in the solutions . since we do not know the precise location of the pole or its residue , we can not extend our parabolas any further .",
    "moreover , there comes a point where the poles affect our numerical stability and lead to a breakdown of the numerical procedure .",
    "this breakdown allows us to determine approximately on which parabola the complex poles are located , where each parabola is characterised by its vertex @xmath155 , the point at which the parabola crosses the real - axis . in table",
    "[ vertex - pole ] we list the vertex of the parabolas on which the complex pole lies , as determined from the schwinger function and as inferred by the breakdown of our numerical method . both methods are in excellent agreement .",
    "this provided additional justification for the fourier - transform method exploited in subsection [ complexresults ] .",
    "while this procedure can in principle be applied to the cp - vertex , whose solutions contain a pole on the negative real - axis , perhaps accompanied by a branch - cut , the numerical solution becomes much more involved due to the derivative - like terms appearing in the vertex . by implementing a robust numerical procedure that deals with this numerical singularities correctly ,",
    "we believe that our method is applicable to finding solutions in the complex plane for such a vertex construction .",
    "we defer a detailed calculation to future work .",
    "we studied the analytic structure of the quark propagator with and without the inclusion of pion effects , in order to compare and contrast with gribov s conjecture of quark confinement due to supercriticality of the colour charge .",
    "he advocated the viewpoint that these pions play an important rle for the confinement of quarks , as indicated in the analytic structure of their propagator .",
    "studying a truncation scheme that essentially includes all features introduced and studied by gribov , we determined the unquenching effects in the quark propagator due to the back - reaction of pions onto the quarks .",
    "our numerical results agree nicely with corresponding lattice calculations thus underlining the reliability of our truncation scheme . investigating the analytic structure of the quark propagator by means of its schwinger functions and direct solutions of the quark - dse in the complex plane we found that the inclusion of pion effects had no qualitative effect .",
    "this is the central result of our work : gribov s conjecture does not seem to hold .    instead , it is the relative strengths of the various tensor components that constitute the fully dressed quark - gluon vertex , in particular whether these are in agreement with those occurring in qed due to the ward - identity .",
    "this finding is in agreement with a previous investigation of the structure of the quark propagator @xcite .",
    "it relegates the question of quark confinement due to positivity violations in its schwinger function to a more refined determination of the details of the quark - gluon vertex , see _ e_.g .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also determined the multiple solutions of the quark - dse as a function of the current quark mass . in the @xmath156-plane",
    "we find a behaviour similar to hysteresis effects in ferromagnets connected to the phenomenon of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "close to the origin of this plane we find the critical behaviour of the wigner solution to be connected to the form of the effective running coupling associated with the quark - gluon interaction .",
    "employing a sufficiently strong coupling with an infrared fixed point as also being used in gribov s work , we find a multitude of solutions near the trivial point .",
    "our approximation scheme for the quark - gluon interaction as a composition of a yang - mills part and a part due to the pion back - reaction onto the quark is a modification of the one used in @xcite .",
    "this modification leads to improved values for low energy constants as the chiral condensate and the pion decay constant and therefore has the potential to describe pion cloud properties of mesons and baryons via bound state equations .",
    "this is further explored elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this work has been supported by the helmholtz - university young investigator grant no vh - ng-332 and by the dfg under grant number ni 1191/1 - 1 .",
    "here we give details of our numerical method for calculating the quark dse for complex momenta . in euclidean space , our quark - dse is conventionally written as @xmath157 with @xmath3 the momentum flowing through the gluon .",
    "we want to solve this equation ( in the previously described approximation ) for complex @xmath93 but using real @xmath39 only .",
    "this also appears on consideration of the bethe - salpeter equations . for those we find ourselves in need of the quark propagator evaluated at momenta @xmath158 with @xmath159 a momentum partitioning parameter and @xmath57 the total momentum of the meson . in euclidean space ,",
    "a bound state in the rest frame has total momentum @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and so the momenta @xmath162 of ( [ eqn : app : momcmplx ] ) define parabolic curves in the complex plane .",
    "the necessary integrals over the angles @xmath163 leads us to require solutions to the quark - dse for all complex momenta bounded by these curves . for equal momentum partitioning , @xmath164 , the region is symmetric about the real - axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : app : par1 ] for an example ) .",
    "the vertex of the parabola is located at @xmath165 and the focus at @xmath166 .      in contemporary bs studies",
    ", one is generally forced to work in the rainbow - ladder approximation whereby the full quark - gluon vertex @xmath168 of ( [ eqn : app : dse ] ) is replaced by its bare counterpart @xmath169 .",
    "we can then solve ( [ eqn : app : dse ] ) for @xmath170 without iteration , requiring only as input the quark propagator on @xmath171 . in practice ,",
    "we need only perform calculations in the upper half - plane , @xmath172 , since solutions are related by complex conjugation .",
    "the caveat , however , is that we require knowledge of the gluon interaction for complex momenta @xmath3 . in general , though the analytic structure of the gluon may be surmised , the analytic continuation of some phenomenological ansatz is at best ill - defined .    to avoid evaluating the gluon for complex momenta",
    ", we modify the momentum routing in the quark - dse such that its momentum is manifestly real .",
    "this amounts to introducing a shift in the integration variable , @xmath173 , which is of course valid in any translationally invariant regularisation scheme .",
    "such schemes are in general not employed in dse studies , for technical reasons , so one should be mindful of any boundary terms that may arise ; with a subtractive renormalisation scheme and careful consideration of the renormalisation conditions these spurious terms may be rigorously eliminated .",
    "what remains is the equation : @xmath174 where again we consider @xmath175 along the parabolas of ( [ eqn : app : momcmplx ] ) , and now @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "now that the integral equation depends on the _ a priori _ unknown quark propagator in the complex plane , we must employ an iterative scheme to obtain solutions .",
    "if we choose a point @xmath93 that lies on a parabola with vertex at @xmath155 , then the integral equation only requires the quark propagator be known in the region of the complex plane bounded by the _",
    "same _ parabola .",
    "the most efficient way to obtain solutions is then to expand in a series of parabolic shells stemming from the real - axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ app : fig : par2b ] . to accelerate the iteration process",
    ", the previously converged shell is extrapolated outwards , using the cauchy - riemann equations , and used as an initial guess for the next shell .    because we are dealing with complex numbers , it is necessary to employ some 2d interpolation scheme .",
    "internally , our parabolic shells are characterised by their vertex @xmath178 and a parameter @xmath179 , shown as stacks in fig .",
    "[ app : fig : par2a ] , which are mapped onto the parabolas of fig .",
    "[ app : fig : par2b ] .",
    "it is thus straightforward to take any point @xmath170 and determine its corresponding value in @xmath180 space .",
    "cubic - spline interpolation is used to interpolate along the closest two shells @xmath181 in @xmath179 , whilst linear interpolation in @xmath182 is sufficient for determining the value in - between .",
    "this essentially leads to interpolation along a parabola , such as the dashed curve shown in fig .",
    "[ app : fig : par2 ] .",
    "the drawback of this approach , however , is that without precise information about the location of the poles and their residues , we are unable to explore beyond the singularities appearing in the quark propagator .",
