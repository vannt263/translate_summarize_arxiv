    "recent fabrication of single layers of graphite ( graphene monolayer)@xcite has posed the interesting question of charged particle energy loss in solid media where the conduction electrons behave distinctly different from those found in ordinary semiconductor heterostructures . in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) realized in semiconductor heterostructures , the conduction electrons behave as ordinary electrons with a parabolic dispersion relation .",
    "in contrast , the dispersion relation obeyed by conduction electrons in graphene monolayer is linear in momentum .",
    "this occurs due to the unique crystal structure of graphene which is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms .",
    "quantum - mechanical hopping between the sublattices of graphene leads to the formation of  two energy bands , and their intersection near the edges of the brillioun zone yields the conical energy spectrum . as a consequence ,",
    "the dispersion relation of electrons and holes bands is linear near @xmath0 points of the brillioun zone which is given by @xmath1 hence , the conduction electrons , known as dirac electrons , behave as massless particles with the effective speed of light @xmath2@xcite . in a graphene monolayer , electron transport is essentially governed by dirac s ( relativistic ) equation , rather than the usual schrodinger equation for nonrelativistic quantum particles .",
    "the relativistic behavior of graphene was first predicted by p. r. wallace@xcite .",
    "it thus provides a unique opportunity to study relativistic quantum dynamics in condensed - matter systems .",
    "the dirac - like gapless energy spectrum was also confirmed recently by cyclotron resonance measurements in graphene monolayer@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we address energy loss experienced by charged particles as they traverse a non - local dynamic quantum plasma of dirac electrons , electrons that obey the dirac equation .",
    "the energy loss calculation performed here requires that we determine the dynamic , non - local dielectric response function for the plasma of dirac electrons .",
    "we determine the dielectric response function within the random - phase - approximation(rpa ) and employ it to calculate the dynamical structure function which yields the stopping power .    since the work of nozieres and pines@xcite , conduction electrons in solids have been treated as a solid state plasma , a gas of electrons in a neutralizing positive background .",
    "moreover , electron energy loss spectroscopy has been an important probe of the dielectric response properties of solid state systems@xcite .",
    "this was brought into clear focus by the pioneering work of ritchie@xcite where the energy loss of a charged particle traversing a bounded solid state plasma was considered .",
    "dynamical processes in a solid state medium have been investigated with a variety of spectroscopic tools which employ an almost monochromatic beam of electrons , photons , neutral atoms or ions which scatter inelastically from the medium under study@xcite .",
    "information concerning the electronic properties of the medium is obtained as a result of the interaction between the probes and the elementary excitations of the medium .",
    "experimentally , this information is obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) and inelastic light scattering studies .",
    "recently , energy loss spectroscopy of free - standing graphene films was performed@xcite    the present paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we give the formulation of the problem . the energy loss rate and stopping power of a 2d dirac plasma",

    "the system under consideration is a 2d quantum plasma of dirac electrons i.e. dirac electrons embedded in a uniform and rigid neutralizing background of positive charges .",
    "we begin by considering the low - energy electronic eigenstates for this system , given by@xmath3 the dirac - like hamiltonian in eq(1 ) is@xcite@xmath4 where@xmath5 are pauli matrices and @xmath6  is the two - dimensional fermi velocity of dirac electrons ( with the characteristic velocity @xmath7@xcite .",
    "conduction electrons in a dirac plasma behave as massless dirac particles with a linear dispersion relation @xmath8 @xcite where @xmath9 indicate the conduction @xmath10 and valence @xmath11 bands , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the two - dimensional wave vector and is given by @xmath13 , here @xmath14 hence , electron dynamics is modelled by the following dirac equation @xmath15 from here onwards we take @xmath16 throughout this calculation .",

    "the plasmon modes at finite wave vectors are given by the zeroes of the dielectric response function given by eq([8 ] ) .",
    "since , in this work , we are primarily interested in the energy loss due to plasmons , we consider the dielectric response function in the high frequency , long wavelength limit @xmath26  which is given as @xcite@xmath27 here @xmath28 @xmath29is the plasma frequency with @xmath30 the fermi energy .",

    "energy loss function is the basic parameter which accounts for the energy lost by the incident charged particle .",
    "it is also the parameter which is of central importance in energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) experiments .",
    "energy loss function is defined as the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric response function . from the dielectric response function given by eq([9a ] ) and introducing the infinitesimally small parameter @xmath37 we obtain@xmath38 evaluating the coefficients @xmath39 and using dirac s prescription @xmath40 , in eq([10a ] ) and then expressing the variables in terms of dimensionless parameters @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 we obtain the energy loss function for graphene monolayer as @xmath44{c}\\delta\\left (   \\frac{\\nu}{\\left (   1-\\frac{\\nu^{2}}{4}\\right )   } -\\sqrt { \\frac{g_{s}g_{v}r_{s}x}{2}}\\right ) \\\\",
