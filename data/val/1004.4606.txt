    "graphene , a thermodynamically stable graphite monolayer , which has been mechanically exfoliated for the first time only a few years ago,@xcite is gaining considerable scientific attention .",
    "this new material looks promising enough for a number of important practical applications , some of which have been long hoped for .",
    "while experimenters are targeted at engineering graphene based devices in the not so distant future , graphene attracts theoreticians as the first existing in the free state physical system , which can be named two  dimensional ( 2d ) without any reservations . undoubtedly , so far unique electronic properties of graphene were the most challenging issue .",
    "these properties directly come up from the honeycomb lattice with its two  atomic structure , inherent in a single atomic layer of graphite .",
    "the lattice structure leads to the dirac dispersion of charge carriers , which makes up the core of studies devoted to graphene .",
    "transport properties of this material are , sure enough , of primary importance for graphene  based electronics . in real crystals ,",
    "transport properties essentially depend on non  ideality of the system and on interaction of carriers with other excitations .",
    "below we are going to focus on imperfections of graphene , and , in particular , on point defects in it .",
    "this allows to rise a question on the spectrum of delocalized carriers , on its dependence on the amount of defects , and , eventually , on such a remarkable quantity as the minimal value of the conductivity .",
    "initially , two main features of the graphene conductivity were singled out .",
    "first of all , the conductivity of graphene devices never dropped below a certain value .",
    "since this minimal value seemed not to vary between different experimental samples , the origin of the universal behavior of the minimal conductivity value has been extensively searched for .",
    "these efforts shaped the famous _ minimum conductivity _ puzzle .",
    "the linear dependence of the conductivity on the gate voltage made up the second feature .",
    "however , the minimal conductivity value has been found soon to be strongly sample dependent,@xcite and the effect of minimum conductivity has been attributed to graphene s imperfections . in view of mentioned features of the graphene conductivity ,",
    "a qualitative difference between charged impurities and point defects has been established.@xcite while it has been demonstrated that charged impurities are able to yield the required linear dependence of conductivity on the gate voltage , point defects were shown to produce the sub  linear conductivity behavior , and , consequently , ruled out as the conductivity limiting factor .",
    "the concept of charged impurities as a main source of the scattering of charge carriers in graphene has been thoroughly developed , @xcite and convincingly compared to the experimental data on graphene with deposited potassium atoms on its surface.@xcite at that , just a constant contribution to the conductivity were ascribed to point defects when fitting the experimental data .",
    "even though the concept of charged impurities looks sounding , experiments on graphene in ethanol environment seriously question the dominant role of the coulomb scatterers.@xcite in addition , the conductivity asymmetry evident in measurements of graphene with deposited potassium atoms has not received the proper explanation yet.@xcite while a moderate asymmetry can be attributed to the disbalance of positively and negatively charged impurities,@xcite the marked asymmetry of conductivity dependence on the gate voltage in graphene doped by transition metals manifests the response that is different from the one , which is expected from the charged impurity centers.@xcite the clearly sub  linear character of conductivity curves corresponding to graphene samples heavily doped by transition metals or lightly doped by the potassium atoms only strengthen the overall impression that we are dealing with the interplay of different types of disorder , and that each one of them should receive a comprehensive treatment in an effort to grasp the conductivity properties in graphene . as an example",
    ", an interplay between charged impurities and point defects , which involves different reaction of these two impurity types to screening effects , can be employed to solve the dilemma of slightly varying minimal conductivity value for graphene placed into a dielectric environment.@xcite    it must be stressed that in the mentioned experiments targeted at finding the main scattering channel for carriers in graphene , different adatoms were deposited on the surface of samples , which otherwise were considered as pristine . in fact , here we are dealing with two different issues again .",
    "one of them is determining what actually limits the conductivity of graphene samples obtained by a certain technique , and another one is analyzing the effect of intentionally added impurities on the conductivity features .",
    "the latter is closely related to the current tendency to functionalize graphene by substitutionals , adatoms , or chemically active groups .",
    "regarding the conducting properties , such an adjustment of graphene can proceed up to a possibility of the metal ",
    "insulator transition , which has been successfully observed in graphene doped by hydrogen atoms recently.@xcite similarly , graphene demonstrated insulating behavior after irradiation by ne ions , which is expected to produce short ",
    "range defects.@xcite    in view of that , before any complex models of impurity centers are constructed , the simple ones should be properly examined in their characteristic aspects . and",
    "the basic model of the point defect is definitely among them , since it allows for a mott transition in impure graphene.@xcite    below we are returning to the common in semiconductor physics model of a binary alloy intending to examine what features of the graphene conductivity it is capable to reproduce .",
    "such short  range impurities violate the electron ",
    "hole symmetry of the system and are naturally providing for the conductivity asymmetry .",
    "this impurity model has been studied either in a weak scattering limit , or in the unitary limit .",
    "we are going to show that this model does exhibit some worthwhile features in  between these two extremes .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the effective conductivity minimum , in contrast to former studies , corresponds not to the dirac point of the spectrum , but to the energy of a single impurity resonance , where the impurity scattering is the strongest .",
    "the host hamiltonian for electrons in graphene is taken in the tight binding approximation with hopping restricted to the nearest neighbors , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hopping parameter for the nearest neighbors,@xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 run over lattice cells , @xmath4 and @xmath5 enumerate two sublattices of the honeycomb atomic arrangement , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron creation and annihilation operators at the respective lattice cites .",
    "substitutional impurities are supposed to be distributed evenly and in uncorrelated manner on lattice sites .",
    "presence of an impurity at a given lattice site is assumed to be manifested only through a change in the respective on  site potential of the tight  binding hamiltonian .",
    "this type of impurity perturbation fully corresponds to the conventional model of a binary alloy with a diagonal disorder , which had been extensively used in physics of real crystals , and sometimes is referred to as the lifshitz ( or isotopic ) model for historical reasons .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian for a disordered graphene has the form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the deviation of the potential at the impurity site , and variable @xmath10 is unity with the probability @xmath11 or zero with the probability @xmath12 , which specifies @xmath11 as the impurity concentration .",
    "the `` per carbon atom '' concentration @xmath11 can be easily converted to the impurity coverage , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inverse area per one carbon atom , and @xmath15 nm is the lattice constant of graphene .    the green s function of a disordered system , @xmath16 after averaging over different impurity distributions , @xmath17 , regains the translational invariance and can be expressed by means of the dyson equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the self  energy , and @xmath20 is the host green s function . when the amount of introduced impurities is moderate , it is possible to implement the modified propagator method.@xcite within this approach , the self ",

    "multiple occupancy corrections are not significant .",
    "thus , the method of modified propagator yields results that are practically indistinguishable from the ones produced by the conventional coherent potential approximation .    the calculation of the diagonal element of the host green s function in the site representation @xmath24 , which will be required for the subsequent analytical treatment of the impurity problem , is given in appendix . from here and on we are choosing the bandwidth parameter @xmath25 , see eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) , as the energy unit . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we will use for the dimensionless energy and the impurity potential following designations : @xmath26 since only energies small compared to the bandwidth , i.e. those , at which the linear dispersion holds in the host system , are considered , the corresponding approximation to the dimensionless diagonal element of the green s function can be written as follows , @xmath27    it is not difficult to see that the diagonal element of the green s function ( [ gf ] ) looks similar to the properly scaled diagonal element obtained within the model of massless dirac fermions for the electron spectrum in graphene .",
    "thus , despite the fact , that the intervalley scattering is , for sure , taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ mp ] ) explicitly , the net result for the single  site scattering will not be qualitatively different from the one for the frequently used model of massless dirac fermions , in which only one dirac cone is retained .",

    "regel criterion can be used to pinpoint precisely the mobility edge position in a disordered system .",
    "similarly , there should be no sharp boundaries between those spectral regions , in which the modified propagator method is applicable , and those ones , in which it is not .",
    "nevertheless , there are strong arguments supporting the estimation that the mobility edge in a disordered system should be located at those energy , at which the renormalized energy phase is close to @xmath45 for the conduction band , and , respectively , to @xmath46 for the valence band .",

    "the approach outlined above is consistent in the spectral domains occupied with extended states , where the renormalized energy phase @xmath35 is either small ( for the conduction band ) or close to @xmath31 ( for the valence one ) .",

    "obviously , the renormalized energy phase is close to @xmath30 in a narrow interval of energies around the shifted dirac point , and thus the above approximation is not valid inside this region .",

    "the dependence of the conductivity on the fermi energy is smooth and almost featureless , while being strongly asymmetric against the shifted dirac point position .",
    "the only exception from the monotonic behavior of the conductivity can be observed in a close vicinity of the dirac point , where the curve manifests a sharp dip , which is barely discernible in the curves corresponding to high impurity concentrations .",

    "the asymmetry of the conductivity dependence on the fermi energy arises from the presence of the severely smeared out impurity resonance , which enhances the impurity scattering .",
    "indeed , the smooth character of the conductivity curve does not resemble the experimentally observed check mark shape .",

    "when the impurity potential is large compared to the bandwidth , a well  defined resonance state is manifested in the electron spectrum.@xcite in the limit of a strong impurity potential , the resonance state energy @xmath65 is determined by the lifshitz equation , @xmath66 while the resonance state damping is given by @xmath67 for the resonance state to be well  defined , the condition @xmath68 must be met .",
    "thus , one should have @xmath69 , which corresponds to a strong impurity perturbation and a resonance energy located close to the dirac point .",
    "the qualitative difference of the strong impurity perturbation case resides not only on the presence of a resonance state in the spectrum , but mainly on the fact that in this case the electron spectrum undergoes a radical rearrangement .",
