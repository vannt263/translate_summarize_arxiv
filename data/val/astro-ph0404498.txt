    "a number of x  ray luminous galaxy clusters show large  scale synchrotron radio emission associated to the intracluster medium .",
    "these diffuse sources are know as radio halos , when they are located at the centre of the hosting cluster and show low or negligible polarization , and radio relics , when found in the cluster outskirts and highly polarized .",
    "both halos and relics have low surface brightness , large linear size ( from @xmath10.5 mpc to more than 1 mpc ) and steep integrated spectra , i.e. @xmath2 ( s @xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",
    "radio halos and relics represent the most striking evidence for @xmath5 g magnetic fields on cluster scale and relativistic electrons diffused within the whole cluster volume ( for a recent review see giovannini & feretti 2002 ) .",
    "the existence of this class of radio sources is believed to be connected to cluster mergers , since thus far they have only been found in clusters with significant signs of a current or recent merging event . in particular",
    "the leading hypothesis for the origin of the observed radio emission from these objects is a re  acceleration process , probably via turbolence powered by cluster mergers , of a population of relatively low energy ( @xmath6 ) electrons , initially injected in the intracluster medium ( two - phase model , brunetti et al .",
    "the cluster a3562 is the easternmost component of the a3558 complex , a chain of three clusters and two sc groups which form a single physically connected structure , whose complex dynamical stage of merging is supported by a large amount of observational data in all bands ( see for instance ettori et al . 1997 , ettori et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the existence of a radio halo at the a3562 centre was confirmed by deep radio observations at 1.4 ghz carried out with vla ( venturi et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the framework of the re  acceleration model ,",
    "the halo in a3562 seems to play a very special role , since its largest linear size ( lls @xmath1 600 kpc ) and 1.4 ghz radio power ( p@xmath7 = 2.14@xmath8 w hz@xmath9 ) are among the lowest values found for this class of radio sources .",
    "the halo nicely fits the correlations existing between the halo radio power and the cluster x  ray luminosity and temperature ( bacchi et al . 2003 ) , extending them to lower values for all quantities involved .    according to the two - phase model , the halo in a3562",
    "could be interpreted either as the result of a low efficiency re - acceleration process or as a young source at the beginning of the re - acceleration phase .",
    "it has been established that the head  tail radio galaxy j13333141 , located within the halo emission , has deposited in the intracluster medium a number of electrons high enough to feed the halo if it has been active for a considerable fraction of its crossing time ( t@xmath10 yrs ) .",
    "this result seems to suggest that the halo at the centre of a3562 is young as compared to the other radio halos known to date ( venturi et al .",
    "however only low frequencies observations allow to discriminate between the two possibilities .",
    "with the purpose of studing the morphology of the halo in a3562 and determine the shape of its synchrotron spectrum at low frequencies , we carried out observations at 235 mhz , 327 mhz and 610 mhz with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , pune , india ) .",
    "thanks to the u  v coverage of this instrument , a range of resolutions at all frequencies ( from few arcsec to tens of arcsec ) is allowed .",
    "this ensures an accurate determination of the total radio flux density of the halo , after a careful subtraction of the individual point sources embedded in the halo emission .",
    "an extended radio emission , located south  west of the halo , surrounds the radio source j13323146 ( figure 1 ) , identified with the brightest galaxy in the sc 1329313 group ( giacintucci et al .",
    "the nuclear component , detected at 1.4 ghz , disappears at low frequency .",
    "this seems to rule out any connection between the low brightness extended emission and an active nucleus , suggesting that its origin is most likely due to cluster merger re  acceleration .",
    "the preliminary results of our low frequency data suggest that the spectrum of the radio halo is steep up to @xmath1 610 mhz , with @xmath11 , and it flattens beyond 610 mhz , with @xmath12 .",
    "this seems to be in good agreement with a very recent re  acceleration phase , supporting the idea that the radio halo in a3562 is young and that its existence is strongly connected to the ongoing major merger in the a3558 complex ( venturi et al . in prep ) ."
