    "a number of searches for narrow resonances at the lhc now display peaks in the region of 1.82.0 tev .",
    "most prominently , a recent atlas search @xcite for a resonance that decays to a pair of standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons contains a local excess of 3.4@xmath5 ( 2.5@xmath5 global ) in the @xmath6 final state at approximately 2  tev .",
    "since the search is fully hadronic , there is only a limited ability to accurately distinguish gauge bosons , and consequently many of the events can also be interpreted as a @xmath7 or @xmath8 resonance , leading to excesses of 2.9@xmath5 and 2.6@xmath5 in these channels respectively .",
    "interest is further piqued when one analyses other resonance searches in a similar mass range . at approximately 1.8  tev , both cms @xcite and atlas @xcite observe excesses in the dijet distributions with a significance of 2.2@xmath5 and 1@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "in addition , a cms search for resonant @xmath1 production @xcite shows a 2.1@xmath5 excess , and another cms search @xcite for a pair of vector bosons , but this time with a leptonically tagged @xmath9 , finds a 1.5@xmath5 excess , both at approximately 1.8  tev . with the exception of the three atlas selections in gauge boson pair production , all these possible signals are completely independent .",
    "we analyze these excesses and perform a general cross - section fit to the data .",
    "it is of course important to not only look at possible signals in the distributions , and for that reason we include all relevant searches that may be sensitive to the same final states as those showing anomalies .",
    "these include diboson analyses from both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "in addition , many models that explain an excess of events in the dijet distribution with a charged mediator will also lead to a peak in a @xmath10 resonance search .",
    "consequently , we also include the most sensitive searches for this particular final state from both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite in our study .",
    "combining all searches , we provide best fit signal cross sections for each of the final states analyzed in order to guide the model building process . in particular we find that the vector boson pair production searches are best described by a @xmath6 or @xmath7 final state , while @xmath8 is disfavoured via limits from semi - leptonic searches . in the associated higgs production fit",
    ", we find preference for the @xmath1 final state , since an excess here is only seen in the single - lepton analysis .",
    "finally , there is good agreement for a dijet signal between atlas and cms , but nothing has been observed so far in the @xmath10 final state .    in order to explain these excesses we focus on the so - called left - right symmetric model ( lrm )  @xcite .",
    "the lrm is based on the low - energy gauge group @xmath2 that can arise for example from an @xmath11 or @xmath12 gut  @xcite .",
    "since there is a new @xmath13 gauge group in addition to the sm , the spectrum now contains both a @xmath14 and charged @xmath15 bosons . in general",
    "the model predicts @xmath16 , which is why we explain the various signals via resonant @xmath15 production and decay . by extending our cross - section fit to the lrm parameters",
    ", we find a region that can explain the excesses while avoiding all current exclusion bounds .",
    "we then examine where our fit suggests the mass of the @xmath14 should be and the discovery potential of the lhc for this state .    in a next step",
    "we also analyze the question of how such a model may be able to simultaneously explain dark matter ( dm ) . if the @xmath3 is to mediate dm annihilation in the early universe the simplest scenario we can find is to include a new charged and neutral particle that would be relatively close in mass in order to co - annihilate effectively .",
    "alternatively , we offer the concrete example that dm annihilation is mediated through the @xmath14 and the dark matter candidate is the neutral component of a new fermionic doublet . in this case",
    ", we see that resonant annihilation is required for the correct relic density and thus we predict the dm mass is @xmath17 .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we give an overview over the atlas and cms searches in which resonances in the mass range 1.82.0  tev have been observed , or which provide constraints in the same or closely related final states .",
    "it is important to note that due to resolution , jet energy scale uncertainties and the limited number of events currently present in the excesses , peaks at 1.82.0  tev can easily be compatible .",
    "even though the most significant excess is observed in the atlas diboson search  @xcite at an invariant mass of 2.0  tev , the majority of excesses are reported closer to an invariant mass of approximately 1.8  tev .",
    "this is why we assume a resonance in the vicinity of 1.81.9  tev in this analysis .",
    "we analyze the results of these searches by performing cross - section fits in each channel individually . for this , we sum bins around this mass region according to the experimental width and jet energy scale of the particular study .",
    "we then perform a cut - and - count analysis on the event numbers in these enlarged signal regions . as input information we take into account the number of observed events , expected backgrounds , efficiencies , and systematic uncertainties , as published by atlas and cms . where necessary information is missing from the publications , we use estimations to the best of our knowledge . in app .",
    "[ sec : appendix ] we list the data we use in more detail .    for the actual fit",
    ", we follow a frequentist approach . in the absence of systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the number of events observed in the signal region , @xmath18 , follows a poisson distribution @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the number of expected events , including the number of expected background events @xmath21 , and the product of the signal production cross section @xmath22 , branching ratios @xmath23 , integrated luminosity @xmath24 , and efficiency as well as acceptance factors @xmath25 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the background prediction @xmath21 and on the signal efficiency @xmath25 are approximated by gaussian distributions .",
    "these nuisance parameters are marginalized .",
    "we neglect correlations between the different systematic uncertainties .",
    "we then calculate a @xmath26 value for each signal cross section in each different final state , using at least @xmath27 pseudo - experiments .",
    "this gives us the significance of the deviation from the sm , best fit points , and confidence regions at @xmath28 and @xmath29 cl .",
    "we also calculate upper limits in a modified frequentist approach ( cls method @xcite ) . in some of the signal regions , our simple cut - and - count strategy leads to model limits that are stronger than those presented by the experiments . in this case , the systematical background error and the signal efficiencies were rescaled to find agreement .",
    "since many of our input parameters involve rough estimations , we have checked that the final results are stable under the variation of these input values .    in a next step ,",
    "we perform combined fits to all studies that contribute to a particular final state . for the combination of individual @xmath26 values we use fisher s method .",
    "again , we present the results in terms of @xmath30 values , best fit points , and confidence regions at @xmath28 and @xmath29 cl .",

    "neutral ) component of this doublet is the dm candidate @xmath249 , the lower ( charged ) component @xmath268 is assumed to be sufficiently heavy for coannihilations to be negligible . since the multiplet @xmath269 has the same quantum numbers as the right - handed leptons , there is the possibility of an undesirable mixing between @xmath249 and @xmath264 , which would reintroduce @xmath248-mediated dm decay .",
    "such mixing can be forbidden by introducing an additional symmetry , for instance a dark sector @xmath270 symmetry .",

    "this is crucial , because if @xmath249 was a dirac fermion , its vector couplings to the @xmath14 and ( through gauge boson mixing ) the @xmath9 would bring it into blatant conflict with direct detection results . for a majorana dm particle",

    "the final state fermions are , however , produced in a spin-1 state due to the chirality structure of the gauge boson couplings",
