    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems consisting of a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) accreting from a low - mass ( @xmath1 ) companion star .",
    "x - ray emission of lmxbs often shows fast x - ray variability in the form of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) , which frequently appear in pairs in certain state simultaneously ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "abramowicz & kluniak ( 2001 ) pointed out that the frequency ratio of the twin - peak hfqpos in the bh source gro j1655 - 40 equals 3/2 , and that this commensurability of frequencies may be a signature of a non - linear resonance .",
    "later , abramowicz et al . ( 2003 ) found a signature of the same commensurable ratio in the twin - peak hfqpos observed in an ns - lmxb , sco x-1 . based on this observational evidence , kluniak and",
    "abramowicz argued in several papers ( kluniak & abramowicz 2001 ; kluniak , abramowicz , & lee 2004 ; kluniak et al .",
    "2004 ) that the twin - peak hfqpos in both bh and ns sources are due to the same physical mechanism  a non - linear parametric resonance in accretion disk global oscillations .    however , while for the bh sources the commensurable ratio 3/2 was quickly confirmed and generally accepted ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) , the presence of the same commensurability in the ns sources is denied by several experts ( e.g. boutelier et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "there is no consensus whether the nature of the twin - peak hfqpos in the two types of lmxbs is the same .",
    "we have proposed a mechanism for the twin kilohertz qpos in ns - lmxbs using the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) alfven wave oscillations , and the results seem to fit the observation well ( li & zhang 2005 ; shi & li 2009 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on an mhd explanation of the hfqpos in bh - lmxbs .",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured the quality factor q for the hfqpos measured in the ns - lmxb 4u 1608 - 52 , and found that q @xmath2 200 .",
    "they argued that such high coherency is impossible to achieve from kinematic effects in orbital motion of hot spots , clumps or other similar features located at the accretion disk surface , because these features are too quickly sheared out by the differential rotation .",
    "although orbital motion can not explain the the hfqpos in lmxbs , the frequencies of several fluid oscillatory modes are expressed by the three characteristic orbital frequencies : the  keplerian \" frequency , the  radial \" epicyclic frequency , and the  vertical \" epicyclic frequency . in the kerr metric",
    ", these three orbital frequencies and the lense - thirring  frame - dragging \" frequency have been listed ( e.g. perez et al . 1997 ) .",
    "several hfqpos models use their ratios ( in various combinations ) to explain the observed 3/2 commensurability .",
    "cui , zhang , & chen ( 1998 ) suggested the lense - thirring nodal precession frequency near the inner stable circular orbit ( isco ) radius as the lower hfqpo frequency , such as the 300 hz qpos in gro j1655 - 40 . the relativistic precession model of stella et al .",
    "( 1999 ) applies to both bh and ns sources ; the pariastron precession frequency and the keplerian frequency were taken as the lower and upper frequencies of the twin hfqpos , respectively , whereas the qpos at much lower frequencies were interpreted in terms of the lense - thirring nodal precession ferquency .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) suggested that a non - axisymmetric magnetic coupling of a rotating bh with its surrounding accretion disk coexists with the blandford - znajek process .",
    "the two frequencies were supposed as the keplerian frequencies of two hotspots , one near the inner edge of the disk and the other somewhere outside , respectively .",
    "wagoner et al . ( 2001 ) considered the modes of the diskoseismic wave , such as g - modes , p - modes and c - modes as the explanation of the hfqpos .",
    "they estimated the masses and angular momenta of some bhs with the measured frequencies of the hfqpos when the g - modes or c - modes were selected .",
    "rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discussed the inertial - acoustic modes in a small - size torus very close to the horizon of the bh while the centrifugal and pressure gradients were selected as the only restoring forces . in this model",
    "the black hole spin had to be very close to the maximal value to produce the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "tassive & bertschinger ( 2008 ) investigated the kinematic density waves in the accretion disks when nothing but the gravity was considered as the restoring force , and several discrete radii were adopted .",
    "several modes in pairs close the ratio ( @xmath0 ) could be got , but the correct frequencies could nt be reproduced .",
    "similar to the parametric resonance models , it is difficult to explain why other modes such as the fundamental frequencies were nt observed except the two modes in pairs .    in modeling hfqpos in bh - lmxbs",
    "two points need to be mentioned .",
    "first , in most models the @xmath0 ratio was often overemphasized and substituted into those models directly .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 ratio of the twin hfqpos in bh - lmxbs is nt rigorous but approximate .",
    "second , the hfqpo frequencies were often considered invariable so that these frequencies ( 168 , 113 hz and 67 , 41hz in grs 1915 + 105 , remillard ( 2004 ) ; 450 , 300 hz in gro j1655 - 40 , strohmayer ( 2001a ) ; 276 , 184 hz in xte j1550 - 564 , miller et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; 240 , 165 hz in h1743 - 322 , homan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) were used to estimate the parameters of the bhs such as the masses and the spins .",
    "in fact , the frequencies are stable , i.e. there are small varitions in them , rather than invariable ( miller et al . 2001 ; remillard et al . 1999 ; morgan et al . 1997 ; strohmayer 2001b ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we suggest the basic model and get two stable modes of the alfven wave by solving the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) equations of the perturbed plasma in bh accretion disks . in section 3",
    "we compare the results with the observations and discuss their possible implications .",
    "we consider that the hfqpos of bh - lmxbs result from grmhd waves caused by perturbations in the disk . according to  2.1",
    "we can find that only one type of grmhd wave , the steady alfven wave , can spread along the magnetic field lines to the energy release region .",
    "the simulation by koide ( 2002 ) also shows that a torsional alfven wave can be generated by the rotational dragging of space .",
    "we assume that the puny disturbance does nt change the metric of the space - time .",
    "the oscillation modes of plasma in accretion disks with or without magnetic field , such as g - modes , p - modes , and c - modes , have ever been investigated ( wagoner et al .",
    "2001 ; fu & lai 2009 ; lai 2009 ) .",
    "here we discuss the grmhd wave modes in ideal adiabatic magnetofluid . in the fiducial observer ( fido )",
    "frame , which is a locally inertial frame , the line element can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the speed of light in vacuum , the roman indices ( @xmath5 ) run from 1 to 3 , and @xmath6 are the coordinates of the fido frame .",

    "since our discussion is limited to the accretion disk we take @xmath22 and get @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance of the plasma from the bh . besides that",
    ", the lapse function and the shift velocity can be expressed as , @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a vector parallel to the toroidal velocity of the plasma .",

    "it is well known that nss generally hold dipolar magnetic fields , and the toroidal field component , induced by difference in the angular velocity between the disk and the ns magnetosphere , can never be stronger than the poloidal component , otherwise the field configuration becomes unstable leading to inflation of the field lines ( e.g. aly 1985 ) . on the other hand , both theories and simulations ( ruzmaikin et al .",

    "additionally , recent observations suggest that the inner disk around an ns may not be an adaf even in low state , as the thermal emission from the surface of the ns would tend to cool an adaf , making such a flow more difficult than in bh systems ( cackett et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "finally , a correlation between the lower hfqpo frequencies and the bh masses has been suggested , i.e. , @xmath229 ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .",
    "this correlation can be naturally reproduced in our model . in fig .  1 we plot the predicted relation between @xmath230 and @xmath231 when @xmath227 changes from @xmath232 to @xmath233 , which fit reasonably with the measured data .",
