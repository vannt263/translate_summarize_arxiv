    "( for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "if the fundamental scale is of the order of a few tev , the products of bh decay could be detected in particle colliders @xcite and in extensive air showers of ultrahigh energies @xcite .",
    "ultrahigh energy cosmic rays provide a natural beam of particles with primary energies up to and above @xmath0 tev that can in principle probe tev scale physics .",
    "the dominant component of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is believed to be protons @xcite generated in extra - galactic sources .",
    "uhecr protons naturally generate ultrahigh energy neutrinos as they traverse intergalactic space through photo - pion production off the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite . the threshold energy for pion production off",
    "the cmb induces a feature in the uhecr spectrum known as the greisen , zatsepin , and kuzmin ( gzk ) feature @xcite .",
    "the flux of neutrino secondaries from the pion production depends on the assumed extra - galactic proton injection spectrum and generally peaks around @xmath5 tev @xcite .",
    "these secondary neutrinos are often called gzk or cosmogenic neutrinos . here",
    "we study the characteristics of extensive air showers initiated by ultrahigh energy neutrinos and compare the production of bhs in tev gravity theories with sm interactions .",
    "ultrahigh energy neutrinos provide a useful means to test tev gravity . in some tev gravity models ,",
    "the neutrino - nucleon cross section , @xmath6 , is greatly enhanced , leading to larger numbers of neutrino - induced air shower events .",
    "in fact , the lack of observed neutrino air showers can be used to place a bound on the neutrino - nucleon cross section that has been translated into constraints on @xmath7 comparable to collider limits @xcite .",
    "however , the physics of bh formation and evolution in tev gravity theories is highly uncertain and model dependent . as we discuss below",
    ", the cross section of the process can only be roughly estimated . while some choices of parameters lead to the enhancement of neutrino - nucleon cross sections compared to the sm , others choices give cross sections for bh formation orders of magnitude below the sm case .",
    "furthermore , the evaporation process of bhs generates additional uncertainties on the fraction of the primary energy that is left to generate a shower .",
    "even if a limit on the neutrino cross - section can be derived from the lack of neutrino - induced air showers ( for example , if the cosmogenic neutrino flux is better constrained ) , translating a bound on @xmath6 into a limit on tev gravity parameters is highly model dependent .",
    "therefore , the identification of quantum gravity effects based solely on neutrino event rates is not very effective .",
    "here we take a different approach by modeling the detailed characteristics of extensive air showers initiated by bh evaporation on a shower - to - shower basis , with the expectation that the large multiplicity of secondaries will lead to detectable signatures .",
    "we first calculate the fragmentation of bh and the spectrum of secondaries .",
    "the secondary particles are then developed with pythia @xcite and aires @xcite into observable extensive air showers .",
    "we find that bh - induced air showers generally differ from ordinary air showers .",
    "differences in shower maxima reach @xmath8 g @xmath9 between bh and sm events which could be easily detected if the first interaction point of the air showers were either observed or fixed by the interaction . unfortunately , the first interaction point of high energy neutrinos in the atmosphere is neither fixed by the interaction nor detectable . unlike protons ,",
    "the interaction length of neutrinos in air is quite large , thus neutrinos interact with almost equal probability at any point in the atmosphere .",
    "moreover , the first interaction point is not directly observed since fluorescence experiments can only detect the air shower once billions of particles have been generated while ground arrays only observe the air shower as it reaches the ground .",
    "shower observables such as the muon content and the rise - depth parameter give indirect signatures that can distinguish bh and sm events in large statistics experiments that combine fluorescence detectors and ground array detectors .",
    "in addition to differences in the overall characteristics of air showers , bh formation produces some unique signatures since the fragmentation secondaries span most particles in the sm .",
    "in particular , heavy bhs may produce several @xmath10-leptons .",
    "multiple @xmath10 s are unique to bh formation and may be differentiated in future uhecr observatories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first part of  ii",
    ", we review bh formation in tev gravity and the physics of the bh - induced atmospheric events .",
    "the aim of this part is to fix notations and make the paper self - consistent . in the second part of ",
    "ii we first focus on the cross section uncertainties , which make the identification of atmospheric bh formation based solely on event rates ineffective .",
    "next we discuss the phenomenology of bh evaporation , which is the backbone of the air shower simulations . in  iii , we describe the monte carlo that we have developed and used to simulate neutrino - induced air showers in the atmosphere .",
    "the main results of the paper are contained in ",
    "iv , where we show the outcome of our simulations and discuss the differences between ordinary air showers and bh - induced air showers . in  v , we briefly discuss possible detection techniques for bh formation based on @xmath10 production in bh fragmentation .",
    "finally , we conclude in  vi .",
    "in models with @xmath11 extra dimensions the fundamental coupling constant of gravity is the @xmath12-dimensional newton s constant @xmath13 the observed four - dimensional newton s constant @xmath14 tev@xmath15 and the @xmath12-dimensional gravitational constant @xmath16 are related by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of the extra dimensions .",
    "if @xmath19 , it follows that @xmath20 . for the appropriate choices of @xmath11 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 can be of the order of tev energies such that gravity and the electroweak scales coincide .",
    "these models provide an attractive solution to the hierarchy problem of high - energy physics .    if gravity becomes strong at the electroweak scale , particle collisions with cm energy larger than a tev can create bhs @xcite , branes @xcite , and other nonperturbative gravitational objects @xcite .",
    "bh formation dominates the gravitational channel if the extra - dimensional space is symmetric whereas branes form in asymmetric cases @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only consider symmetric compactification and bh production since brane decay is even less understood than bh evaporation .",
    "the static and uncharged bh in @xmath12-dimensions is described by the @xmath12-dimensional schwarzschild solution @xmath23 where @xmath24 the schwarzschild radius @xmath25 of the bh is related to the mass @xmath26 by @xmath27^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{rmrel}\\ ] ] at energy scales sufficiently above @xmath22 , bh formation is a semiclassical process .",
    "thus the cross section can be approximated by an absorptive black disk with radius @xmath25 . for a schwarzschild bh",

    "the total cross section for a neutrino - proton event is obtained by summing over partons : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite , @xmath36 is the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath37 is the fraction of nucleon s momentum carried by the parton , and @xmath38 is the minimal bh mass for which the semiclassical cross section is valid ( generally @xmath39 few @xmath22 )",
    ".    equation should be interpreted with care as the total cross section value is affected by several sources of uncertainty .",
    "the first uncertainty comes from the approximate knowledge of the pdfs .",
    "for instance , the uncertainty in the gluon distribution ( the most uncertain distribution ) is @xmath40 15% for @xmath41 and increases rapidly for large @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pdfs are known only for momentum transfer smaller than 10 tev . in bh events",
    "we expect the momentum transfer to be of the order of either the mass or the inverse schwarzschild radius @xcite .",
    "therefore , the momentum transfer can reach hundreds of tev in uhecr - induced bh events . in the calculation of the total cross section we fix the pdfs for momentum transfers above 10 tev to be equal to the 10 tev value .",
    "although the dependence of the pdfs on the momentum transfer seems quite small ( at least for momentum transfers smaller than 10 tev ) , the 10 tev cutoff on the momentum transfer induces an additional uncertainty in the integrated cross section eq .. a conservative estimate of the total uncertainty due to the pdfs is @xmath40 20% .    a second major source of uncertainty in eq .",
    "derives from the physics of bh formation at the parton level , which is presently not well understood .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the dynamics of the process at parton level are parametrized by the form factor @xmath31 and have been summarized in refs .",
    "the two main factors that may affect eq .",
    "are the uncertainty in the fraction of the initial cm energy that goes into the bh and the presence of angular momentum .",
    "numerical simulations for head - on collisions in four dimensions suggest that the mass of the bh is smaller than the cm energy of the colliding particles , leading to a reduction of the total cross section .",
    "rotating bhs have also smaller cross sections than non - rotating bhs .",
    "a naive estimate of the corrections due to angular momentum suggests a reduction of the cross section of about 40% . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - relativistic limit of two - bh scattering indicates that the geometrical cross section can be enhanced by a factor @xmath42% , depending on the spacetime dimension . the classical cross section for photon capture",
    "can also be used to obtain a crude estimate of the cross section of bh formation , suggesting an enhancement of the cross section by a factor ranging from 300% ( @xmath4 ) to 87% ( @xmath43 ) .    to our knowledge",
    ", all the quantitative results of the past literature are obtained from eq . by setting @xmath44 and neglecting the pdf uncertainties .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite . ) this is partially motivated by the fact that an exact estimate of the total uncertainty in the bh cross sections due to the combined pdf and parton - level uncertainties is unattainable at present . however , the arguments listed above suggest that the cross section uncertainties range from @xmath40 40% to @xmath40 300% which can significantly affect most results . throughout this paper , we take into account these uncertainties when deriving observables .",
    "the cross section as a function of @xmath22 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the uncertainties described above are shown in fig.[crossfigure1 ] .",
    "the upper left , upper right , and lower left panels show @xmath47 as a function of @xmath45 for three different incoming neutrino energies ( @xmath48 @xmath49 , and @xmath50 tev ) , for different values of @xmath22 ( disks for @xmath51 1 tev , triangles for @xmath51 2 tev , stars for @xmath51 5 tev , and circles for @xmath51 10 tev ) , and for the case of seven dimensions ( @xmath52 , red symbols ) and ten dimensions ( @xmath53 , black symbols ) .",
    "the symbols give the cross section calculated from eq .",
    "setting @xmath44 and neglecting the pdf uncertainties .",
    "the lower right panel shows the cross section as a function of energy for @xmath54 tev and ten dimensions .",
    "the red shaded ( inner ) region shows the uncertainty in the cross section due to the unknown @xmath45 which we vary from @xmath22 to 10 @xmath22 .",
    "the green shaded ( outer ) region shows the uncertainty associated with the bh formation at the parton level and the pdf .",
    "the solid lines in the graphs show the cross section for sm interactions .",
    "the uncertainty in the sm cross section due to the unknown pdfs at very small values of @xmath37 is bracketed by dashed lines .    for a given number of extra dimensions , the total cross section increases with the energy of the primary neutrino and",
    "decreases when the fundamental scale is increased . at fixed energy and @xmath22",
    ", the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "the overall effect makes the cross section at fixed energy vary by many orders of magnitude .",
    "for instance , the ten - dimensional total cross section at @xmath55 tev spans five orders of magnitude , ranging from values of tens of pb to millions of pb , where the lower values are obtained for large fundamental scales . at fixed energy and @xmath22 , the range in cross section values span about an order of magnitude unless @xmath45 becomes comparable to the cm energy of the event . in this case , the rate of events is dramatically suppressed and the cross section tends to zero . the behavior of the total cross section with the energy at fixed @xmath22 is steeper for higher values of @xmath45 . in the range @xmath56 tev , which is of interest to uhecrs",
    ", the cross section grows approximately like @xmath57 , where lower exponents are obtained for lower @xmath45 .",
    "for example , in ten dimensions the behavior of the cross section is @xmath58 for @xmath59 tev , @xmath60 for @xmath61 tev , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 tev .",
    "the large uncertainties in the values of @xmath47 make it quite difficult to discriminate between different values of the fundamental scale @xmath7 with good precision . the range of possible @xmath47 for a given @xmath7 overlaps with the range for larger @xmath7 because of the theoretical uncertainties . even if @xmath47 were to be constrained by experiments , @xmath22 could not be determined unless the degeneracy were removed by additional assumptions on @xmath45 and by reducing other theoretical uncertainties in @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on @xmath11 is the least dramatic making it also hard to differentiate between different dimensions .",
    "in addition , as @xmath7 becomes larger than @xmath64 tev , @xmath47 becomes smaller than the cross section for sm interactions and the probability for bh formation decreases accordingly .",
    "once the cm energy of a neutrino collision with a nucleon in the air reaches the bh formation threshold , a bh with initial mass equal to a fraction of the total cm energy may form .",
    "the distribution of the initial bh masses is given by the differential cross section @xmath65 light bhs are favored over heavy bhs .",
    "the typical initial bh mass is usually a few times @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , models with larger ( smaller ) fundamental planck scale tend to produce higher ( lower ) mass bhs . the integrated probability of bh formation vs the initial bh mass is plotted in fig.[probmass ] for a neutrino energy @xmath66 tev , @xmath53 , @xmath67 tev and @xmath68 .",
    "the initial bh mass is very sensitive to the value of @xmath45 . for @xmath69 , 90% of the formed bhs",
    "have initial mass less @xmath70 tev , whereas for @xmath71 the 90% threshold is reached at @xmath72 tev .    once formed , the bh decay phase is expected to proceed in three stages : classical , semiclassical , and quantum @xcite . in the first stage",
    "the bh sheds the hair associated with gauge charges and angular momentum . in the second stage",
    "the bh evaporates semiclassically by emission of thermal hawking radiation with temperature @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that most of the energy is radiated into the brane , as only gravitons can `` see '' the bulk @xcite .",
    "the hawking evaporation ends when the mass of the bh approaches @xmath74 . at this point",
    "the semiclassical description breaks down and the bh may either decay completely by emitting a few quanta with energy of order of @xmath22 or leave a stable remnant with mass @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the details of this last stage depends on the unknown underlying quantum theory .",
    "however , the semiclassical decay should lead to most of the observable signatures .",
    ".decay time in the cm frame ( @xmath10 , in units of @xmath75 s ) , initial temperature ( @xmath73 in tev ) , initial entropy ( @xmath76 ) , average number of produced quanta ( @xmath77 ) , and energy per quantum ( @xmath78 in tev ) of schwarzschild bhs for various @xmath7 ( tev ) , @xmath26 ( tev ) , @xmath53 and @xmath52 ( in parentheses ) .

    "these quanta are translated into sm particles some of which decay or hadronize .",

    "extensive air showers created by ultrahigh energy interactions in the atmosphere can be detected with ground arrays and fluorescence telescopes .",
    "ground arrays record the signal which is produced by the particles of the shower reaching the ground .",
    "fluorescence telescopes observe the fluorescence light produced by the interaction of the atmospheric nitrogen molecules with the electromagnetic component of the developing air shower . the fluorescence method pioneered by the fly s eye @xcite detector is able to reconstruct the longitudinal development of the @xmath81 component of the air shower .",
    "fluorescence detectors are currently used by the hires @xcite and auger @xcite experiments and are planned for the future euso @xcite and owl @xcite observatories .",
    "this technique provides a good estimate of the energy of the primary particle that initiate the air shower , since most of the energy of the air shower goes into the observable electromagnetic channel .",
    "another advantage of the fluorescence technique is the ability to reconstruct the depth at which the cascade contains the maximum number of @xmath81 pairs , i.e. , the depth of shower maximum , @xmath82 .",
    "this parameter is sensitive to the type of primary particle , to its energy and to the interaction initiating the cascade .",
    "the depth of the first interaction point , @xmath83 , depends on the total cross section of the particle considered . due to the small values of the neutrino - air cross sections",

    "the number of secondaries in pair production or bremsstrahlung interactions is smaller than in hadronic interactions .",

    "a difference of @xmath8 g @xmath9 in @xmath82 is evident between the sm and bh events .",
    "this large difference results from the combination of the large multiplicity and hadronic nature of bh - induced air showers and electromagnetic nature of the cc - induced air showers .",
    "bh - induced air showers generally develop faster than typical sm hadronic air showers depending on the initial and minimum masses of the bh that give the number of produced quanta .",

    "the difference between the two cases is no longer apparent .",
    "cc - induced air showers have large fluctuations in @xmath89 ( fig.[longi1 ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to fluctuations in the fraction of primary energy carried by the scattered electron .",
    "this fraction is usually large such that cc - induced air showers behave often like electromagnetic air showers . on the odd occasion that a large fraction of the primary energy is carried by partons ,",
    "the air shower is closer to a hadronic air shower .",
    "in addition , the lpm effect increases the fluctuations in @xmath89 of electromagnetic air showers , if the energy of the scattered electron ( @xmath113 ) is larger than @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of particles at shower maximum , @xmath115 , is proportional to the primary particle energy , which is more stable in the electromagnetic cascade case ( fluctuations in @xmath115 are on the @xmath116% level ) .",
    "in contrast , bh - induced air showers have small fluctuations in @xmath89 and large fluctuations in @xmath115 . the fluctuations in @xmath89 are consistent with the fluctuations of sm hadronic - induced air showers .",
    "the large fluctuation in @xmath115 ( @xmath70% ) is due to the supersposition of two effects : ( i ) each quantum usually carries a large fraction of the primary energy and ( ii ) some of the produced quanta do not contribute to the shower energy ( neutrinos , gravitons , @xmath100 s , and non - decaying @xmath10 s ) .",

    ", the average @xmath89 for bh - induced air showers is 770 ( 840 ) g @xmath9 and 970 ( 1250 ) g @xmath9 for sm - induced air showers .",
    "the spread is 62 ( 72 ) g @xmath9 and 75 ( 140 ) g @xmath9 .",
    "the difference between the bh and cc air showers increases with the energy because the difference between hadronic and electromagnetic air showers also increases with energy ( below @xmath102 tev bh and sm showers are indistinguishable ) . since @xmath83 is not observable , we define an observable `` rise - depth '' parameter for each individual shower , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the slant depth where the shower has 10 % of particle content of the shower maximum .",
    "@xmath120 is a more realistic parameter as a discriminator between bh- and cc - initiated air showers because it is observable .",
    "the right panels of fig.[rise ] show the @xmath120 distributions for sm- and bh - induced air showers at energies @xmath102 tev ( upper panel ) and 10@xmath121 tev ( lower panel ) .",
    "the separation between the distributions is evident at @xmath55 tev .",
    "this trend is better seen in fig.[rise_evol ] where @xmath120 vs @xmath115 is plotted for different primary energies . to clearly see the difference in the distributions it would be necessary to accumulate a large number of neutrino air showers . for the cosmogenic neutrino flux , we would expect one @xmath50 tev neutrino for every dozen @xmath49 tev neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , the cosmogenic neutrino flux is barely detectable by experiments under construction ; at most a few events between @xmath5 and @xmath49 tev are expected to be detected per year @xcite .",
    "either there are larger unexpected fluxes of neutrinos or larger detectors will be needed that can accumulate enough statistics to discriminate between bh and sm interactions through the @xmath120 distribution .",
    "we also simulated the longitudinal development of @xmath100 s for each individual shower .",
    "since @xmath100 s are detected on the ground , we calculated the @xmath100 number for different positions of the ground detector relative to @xmath82 .",
    "in fig.[nmu ] , we show the number of @xmath100 s vs @xmath115 for 50 air showers at a depth @xmath122 , where @xmath123 168 , 336 , and 672 g @xmath9 @xmath115 is essentially proportional to the observed energy .",
    "cc - induced air showers are @xmath100-poor because of their electromagnetic nature , whereas bh - induced air showers are @xmath100-rich like hadronic air showers .",
    "to summarize , two features should be used to find evidence of bh formation in extensive air showers : the rise depth and the @xmath100 content of the air showers .",
    "the main differences arise from the electromagnetic nature of the cc - induced air showers in contrast to the hadronic character of the bh air showers . to take advantage of the differences in @xmath100 content and the @xmath120 distribution",
    ", an experiment should combine both ground and fluorescence observations for each individual air shower .",
    "the pierre auger observatory is the first such hybrid detector consisting of a ground array which sample the particle content at a given depth , looked over by four fluorescence detectors which may determine @xmath82 and @xmath120 . for shower core distances larger than @xmath64 km and",
    "@xmath124 larger than @xmath125",
    "g @xmath9 most of the signal recorded in the ground detectors is dominated by @xmath100 s and thus is directly sensitive to the difference in @xmath100 content between bh and cc - induced air showers . the only challenge for the auger observatory to test the bh hypothesis is the low neutrino flux .",
    "if the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is at the level of the expected cosmogenic flux , a larger version of the auger hybrid detector would be needed to test these theories .      in the previous sections we compared sm- and bh - induced air showers for @xmath53 and @xmath126 tev .",
    "the previous results can be generalized to different choices of these parameters .",
    "the two quantities that characterize the bh air showers are the cross section and the multiplicity of particles . the cross section uncertainties considered in  ii affect the first interaction point , but do not affect the shower development .",
    "the main factors that can change the physical characteristics of the air showers are the multiplicity and the nature of secondaries originated from the bh evaporation .",
    "the multiplicity is controlled by the mean number of quanta , @xmath127 , produced in the bh evaporation .",
    "most of these quanta are quarks and gluons that hadronize and initiate a number of hadronic cascades with average energy ( laboratory frame ) @xmath128 .",
    "these sub - showers reach a maximum at the same depth .",
    "thus the maximum of the shower , which is the sum of all sub - showers , is given by the maximum of a hadronic air shower with energy @xmath129 .",
    "the shower maximum has a logarithmic dependence on the energy : @xmath130+b\\,.\\ ] ] the simulations give @xmath131 60 g @xmath9 and @xmath132 g @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath133 is the change in @xmath89 per decade of energy and is analogous to the more commonly used elongation rate , which is the change in @xmath82 per decade of energy .",
    "our results agree well with the experimental results and previous simulations that give an elongation rate @xmath134 g @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the number of quanta depends on the bh mass and differs for each individual air shower .",
    "moreover , the number of quanta varies with @xmath7 and @xmath11 at fixed energy .",
    "the shift in the shower maximum of two distinct showers initiated by @xmath135 and @xmath136 quanta is @xmath137 for instance , if the number of quanta increases by a factor of 3 ( 10 ) , @xmath82 decreases by 29 ( 60 ) g @xmath9 .",
    "the left panel of fig.[longibh1 ] compares the longitudinal development of bh - induced air showers for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath126 tev .",
    "the primary energy is set to @xmath102 tev , and @xmath83 is the same for both air showers .",
    "the number of quanta produced in the bh evaporation decreases for larger @xmath11 .",
    "approximately three times more quanta are produced for @xmath52 at fixed @xmath26 .",
    "this translates into a shift in @xmath82 of @xmath138 g @xmath9 .",
    "the right panel of fig.[longibh1 ] shows @xmath82 for @xmath139 tev and 5 tev with @xmath53 and @xmath140 . at fixed @xmath26",
    "the number of quanta for @xmath139 tev is six times larger than for @xmath141 tev .",
    "however , as @xmath26 is usually slightly larger than @xmath45 , the @xmath141 tev case starts with a more massive bh overall and hence produces a larger number of quanta than @xmath139 tev case ( see fig.[probmass ] ) .",
    "these two effects counteract and compensate each other , leading to the same number of quanta for both cases and no shift in @xmath82 as shown in fig.[longibh1 ] .",
    "fig.[longibh2 ] shows the variation in the longitudinal development for @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath26 changes by a factor five , thus increasing the number of quanta by the same factor .",
    "this is translated into a shift in @xmath82 of @xmath144 g @xmath9 , in good agreement with eq ..    the variation of @xmath82 with @xmath7 and the number of dimensions have no effect on the conclusions obtained in the previous section .",
    "the two parameters discussed to discriminate between bh- and sm - induced air showers do not depend on the position of the shower maximum .",
    "the observable signatures are based on the difference between the electromagnetic nature of the cc - induced air showers and the hadronic nature of the bh - induced air showers .",
    "therefore , deeply penetrating horizontal hadronic - looking air showers will generally signal bh formation .",
    "in the previous sections we discussed the different characteristics of neutrino initiated air showers in the atmosphere for sm interactions compared to the formation of tev bhs . given the uncertainties in the bh formation , evaporation processes , and the inherent fluctuations of air showers , clear signals of bh formation are difficult to extract and require a large number of neutrino events .",
    "the problem is analogous to separating proton - induced air showers from gamma - ray air showers , but with an additional unknown @xmath83 .",
    "if future experiments can observe both @xmath120 and @xmath100 s of a large number of neutrino air showers , a separation between sm and bh events could be reached .",
    "given the low expected flux of ultrahigh energy neutrinos , hybrid observatories larger than auger would be necessary .",
    "as an alternative to a large study of neutrino induced air showers , bh fragmentation may be observable via a few events that have no significant background .",
    "for instance , the production of @xmath10 leptons in bh evaporation have no significant counterpart in the sm air showers .",
    "the fragmentation of heavy bhs may allow multiple @xmath10 production with @xmath10 energies two or more orders of magnitude lower than the primary neutrino energy .",
    "this kind of process is strongly suppressed in sm interactions .",
    "one effect of the lower energy of @xmath10 s produced in bh interactions versus the sm case is the shorter decay length of the generated @xmath10 . as a concrete example , if a neutrino with energy @xmath145 tev crosses the andes mountains towards the auger observatory this neutrino - induced bh can produce one or more @xmath10 leptons with energies around @xmath146 tev .",
    "these @xmath10 s would decay at a distance of about 5 km from the mountains where the auger observatory is located .",
    "a shower from one such @xmath10 decay from the direction of the andes would be surprising and even more so if two decays from that direction were to occur . if the same neutrino had a sm interaction it could create a single @xmath10 with about @xmath147 tev .",
    "this sm produced @xmath10 will decay after traveling about 100 km , past the auger observatory .",
    "this example illustrates that for a given neutrino flux and flavor content , the number of produced @xmath10 s may help separate rare events that have a bh origin versus a sm origin .",
    "earth - skimming events @xcite would also show different energies for the generated @xmath10 s . a significant study of these signatures depends on detailed assumptions of the neutrino flux and the detector capabilities and will be more fully addressed elsewhere .",
    "we considered the possibility of using uhecr observations to detect effects from tev gravity theories .",
    "we focused our attention on the formation and fragmentation of bhs at tev cm energies and found that distinguishing bh formation and sm air showers is much more challenging than previously expected .",
    "the first challenge on this type of study is the unknown details of bh formation and fragmentation .",
    "the bh formation cross section has large uncertainties and varies by orders of magnitude with model parameters that include the number of extra dimensions , the energy scale of extra dimensions , and the minimum mass of bhs . in principle , contrasting the observed neutrino flux with the expected neutrino flux can help constrain the neutrino nucleon cross section , but the uncertainties of the bh cross section limit the translation of these constraints into constraints on tev gravity parameters .",
    "we showed that bh forming interactions generate very different air showers from sm interactions , but the inability of realistic detectors to observe the first interaction point hides most of the difference between these air showers .",
    "we proposed two parameters that show the different characteristics of the two types of air showers : the rise - depth and the muon content of the air showers .",
    "the bh air showers tend to rise faster , given their large multiplicity , and have larger muon contents , given their hadronic nature .",
    "a bh air shower is similar to a hadronic air shower that can occur at a much higher depth in the atmosphere , i.e. , a very deeply penetrating hadronic air shower . deeply penetrating sm air showers are dominated by cc processes that generate electromagnetic air showers .",
    "sm neutrino air showers are similar to deeply penetrating photon - showers .",
    "the rise - depth and the muon content can help distinguish these characteristics of the sm and bh types of air showers , but the process requires a large number of events to overcome the inherent fluctuations that generally occur from shower - to - shower .",
    "given that present observatories are not large enough to study a large number of neutrino events , the kind of distinction we propose will not be achieved in the near future .",
    "in addition to proposing the study of different air shower characteristics , we suggested that unique events can arise from bh formation which are suppressed in sm interactions , such as the multiple @xmath10 generation .",
    "the rate for these events is low if the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is at the level of the expected cosmogenic neutrinos .",
    "however , unusual air showers from the direction of a mountain chain can signal both a larger flux of neutrinos and a departure form the sm interactions .",

    "<S> large theoretical uncertainties in the black hole cross section weaken attempts to constrain tev gravity based solely on differences between predicted and observed event rates . </S>",
    "<S> the large multiplicity of secondaries in black hole fragmentation enhances the detectability of tev gravity effects . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate tev black hole air showers using pythia and aires , and find that black hole - induced air showers are quite distinct from standard model air showers . however , the limited amount of information registered by realistic detectors together with large air shower fluctuations limit in practice the ability to distinguish tev gravity events from standard model events in a shower by shower case . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible strategies to optimize the detectability of black hole events and propose a few unique signatures that may allow future high statistics detectors to separate black hole from standard model events . </S>"
