    "significant contributions of type 2 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) to the large line ew has been ruled out ( see  4.2 below )",
    ". the large line ew could also likely be due to the clumpy and dusty inter - stellar medium in the galaxy which could attenuate the continuum photons but resonantly scatter the line photons at the surface of the dusty clouds , thus increase the observed ew ( neufeld 1991 ; hansen & oh 2006 ; finkelstein et al . 2007 ; 2008 ; 2009 ) .",

    "the ly@xmath3 line ew is a monotonic decreasing function of the broad to narrow band flux density ratio . in the figure",
    "we can see that these spectroscopically confirmed laes and undetected sources have a consistent distributions of broad to narrow band flux density ratio .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that two distributions are indistinguishable ( @xmath37 = 85% ) .",
    "this demonstrates that high ew candidates are confirmed at the same rate .    in table 3",
    "we also present the line equivalent width for all the spectroscopically confirmed z @xmath2 4.5 galaxies . due to the large uncertainty in estimating the continuum level from optical spectra",
    ", we utilize narrow and broad band photometry to derive the line equivalent width .",
    "following maholtra & rhoads ( 2002 ) , we calculate the rest frame line ew as f@xmath38/@xmath39/(1+@xmath1)=(@xmath40 - @xmath41)/(@xmath15 - @xmath42)/(1+@xmath1 ) , where f@xmath38 is the ly@xmath3 line flux , @xmath39 the continuum flux density , @xmath43 and @xmath44 the widths of the @xmath15 band ( 1568 ) and the narrow band ( 80 ) , and @xmath15 and @xmath42 the integrated fluxes in the @xmath15 band and narrow band respectively .",
    "consistent with malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) , we find only 50% of the confirmed laes show measured line ew @xmath5 240  in the rest frame .",
    "the rest either show larger ew or no detection of continuum at all .",
    "it s clear that the uncertainty in line ew mainly comes from that of the continuum , especially for high ew sources , we thus calculate the uncertainty of the line ew by applying 1@xmath14 errorbar to the measured @xmath15 band flux .",
    "in many cases that the upper limits of the line ew can not be constrained , lower limits are given .",
    "we point out that the line ew distributions of different selected samples are sensitive to the selection criteria adopted .",
    "particularly , the requirement of broad band detection ( i.e. hu et al . 2004 ) would exclude very high ew sources .",
    "for instance , only 1 out of 7 laes at redshift 3.7 selected by fujita et al . (",
    "2003 ) in subaru / xmm - newton deep field show rest frame line ew above 200  ( based on narrow and broad band photometry ) , however , this is after they excluded the candidates without broadband detection , most of which ( 6 out 7 ) , if located at redshift 3.7 , show line ew above 200 , consistent with lala surveys .",
    "the ew distribution is also likely sensitive to the relative depths of the broad and narrow band images , e.g. , deeper broad band images could enable detection of more sources with smaller ews because more sources with stronger continuum could pass the selection due to smaller broadband flux uncertainty .",
    "we have presented above that most of the sources with high ews have no broadband detection at all .",
    "it s interesting to note that if we sum the broad and narrow band fluxes for all the confirmed laes , we obtained an average ew of 182@xmath45 .",
    "if we sum the broad and narrow band fluxes for the confirmed laes with @xmath5 3@xmath14 continuum detection ( 100 out of 110 ) , we derived an average ew of 316@xmath46 .",
    "this also demonstrates that a large population of these individual laes have high ew .",
    "one final concern on the weak continuum level is whether they are physically weak or due to selection bias .",
    "that is , did the selection favor the sources whose broad band fluxes were underestimated due to random fluctuations ? if this were an important effect , there should be one immediate consequence : these high ew sources would be systematically brighter in an independent broadband image .",
    "we adopted the independent broadband images obtained with mmt ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2007 ; wang et al . 2007 ) to test this possibility . in fig .",
    "[ com ] we plot ctio r band flux versus mmt r `` flux '' for 44 confirmed laes with r band coverage . here",
    "the mmt r `` flux '' was scaled by a factor which was derived by requiring that the clipped average @xmath47 color be zero for the full list of sources well detected in both images .",
    "we note that the band pass of mmt r band is not identical to that of ctio band , however , considering mmt r band has much better efficiency between 6500  to 7200  than ctio r band , while ctio r band extends to 8000  with transmission below 40% , the fluxes from two bands are comparable for our purpose . from the figure",
    "we can see that these laes have consistent r band fluxes , suggesting the possible selection bias we mentioned above , if there is any , is weak .",
    "the clearest exception is that fluxes that appear negative in the r band image ( and whose r fluxes are therefore surely underestimated due to photon noise ) mostly have r fluxes that are zero or slightly positive .",
    "ew calculations show that 24 out of 44 confirmed laes with r band flux measurements have ew above 240  based on old r band measurements , while 21 of the 44 show ew above 240  based on r band fluxes .",
    "the ew calculations based on r band fluxes have been adjusted to the r band transmission curve .",
    "we conclude that the high ews we have obtained are physically real , and can not be fully ascribed to selection bias .",
    "stacking a large number of spectra could further help us understand the nature of the line emitters , especially for those with low signal to noise ratio . in fig .",
    "[ coadd ] we present the stacked spectrum of all 110 confirmed ly@xmath3 emitters at @xmath1 @xmath2 4.5 .",

    "the errorbars on @xmath29 and @xmath30 are also estimated based on large number of monte carlo simulations in which we added random noise to each data bin .    in the co - added spectrum , we searched for possible civ @xmath321549 and he ii @xmath321640 line in the vicinity of expected wavelengths , however , neither of them could be detected at above 2@xmath14 level .",
    "based on the flux uncertainties in the spectra , we obtained 2@xmath14 detection limit ( by fixing the line width to that of ly@xmath3 ) to the flux ratio of @xmath48(civ @xmath321549)/@xmath48(ly@xmath3 ) and @xmath48(he ii @xmath321640)/@xmath48(ly@xmath3 ) , which are 3.7% and 7.4% respectively .",
    "these constraints are significantly stronger than we previously obtained based on 11 laes spectra with keck ( 8% and 13% respectively , dawson et al .",
    "we find significantly different success rates and total numbers of candidates obtained in images from different narrowband filters ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the small number of candidates in the ha16 filter can be ascribed to the shallower depth in the ha16 narrow band image , and the lower success rate could thus be due to a higher percentage of contamination from noise spikes ( assuming the total number of spurious detections due to noise spikes per image remains constant ) and asteroids ( with a small number of frames , asteroids could leave more spurious features in the stacked image ) .",
    "the ha12 narrowband image has the same depth as ha0 , ha4 and ha8 bands , yet has many fewer candidates detected .",
    "this indicates that the source density at the redshift 4.50@xmath49 is much smaller than that in the redshift range of 4.39 - 4.47 ( covered by ha0 , ha4 and ha8 filter ) .",
    "the success rates and number of candidates in ha0 , ha4 and ha8 filters are similar , with ha8 having marginally more candidates , and a marginally lower confirmation rate .    in fig .",
    "[ sky ] we plot the spatial distributions of the candidates selected in each narrowband image .",

    "[ sky ] requires careful examination on the candidate selection effect , the coverage of mask design , and the success rate of each mask in each narrow band , etc , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however we note that the amplitude of the drop in lae source density at redshift 4.50@xmath49 ( 66% ) is consistent with the cosmic variance calculation ( trenti & stiavelli 2008 ) , which gives a 40% cosmic variance ( 1@xmath14 ) for the volume of our survey .      significant contributions of agns to the large line ew has been ruled out with deep x - ray exposure and optical spectra ( e.g. see malhotra et al .",

    "interestingly , this limit is below the agn detection fraction for nearby ( redshift @xmath55 ) laes , reinforcing the observation of agn fraction evolution by finkelstein et al ( 2009b ) .",
    "the search for the first generation ( or pop iii stars ) is one of the major targets in observational studies .",
    "however , until now there is no strong evidence of the detection of pop iii stars , and the search for such objects remains a major observational challenge ( schaerer 2008 ) .",
    "recent numerical calculations have shown that since lyman continuum flux increases with decreasing metallicity in stellar populations , very low metallicity stellar population can produce strong ly@xmath3 line with maximum ew @xmath17 400 ",
    "850  for @xmath56 @xmath5 10@xmath57 @xmath58 ( e.g. schaerer 2003 ; tumlinson , shull & venkatesan 2003 ) .",
    "besides strong ly@xmath3 emission line , pop iii or very low metallicity stellar population is also expected to produce strong he ii @xmath321640 due to its much stronger he ii ionizing continuum .",
    "thus many studies have been performed to search for strong he ii @xmath321640 emission line in the spectra of high redshift laes , but no positive detection has been obtained yet .",
    "consistent with malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) and ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we have found a large population of spectroscopically confirmed laes with rest frame ly@xmath3 line ew above 240 .",
    "we have stated above that these high ews are real .",
    "this is in contrast to low ews found at @xmath1 = 3.1 & 2.2 ( gronwall et al . 2007",
    "; nilsson et al . 2009 ) , whether this is due to cosmic evolution or different selection criteria is not clear .",
    "we have also ruled out significant contribution of agn to the large ew (  4.2 ) .",
    "another possibility to the observed large ly@xmath3 ew is due to very metal - poor or pop iii stars .",
    "however , in both the individual and the co - added imacs spectra , we detect no evidence of he ii @xmath321640 emission line . in the co - added spectrum , the he ii @xmath321640 emission line flux is constrained to be @xmath59 7.4% ( 2@xmath14 ) of that of ly@xmath3 .",
    "such an upper limit can be converted to log ( q@xmath60/q@xmath61 ) @xmath5 - 1.4 , where q@xmath60 and q@xmath61 are ionizing fluxes for he+ and h respectively ( schaerer 2003 ) .",
    "this upper limit is close to the maximum predicted values for metal - free populations with imfs including very massive stars ( up to 500 m@xmath62 , see fig .",
    "5 of schaerer 2003 ) .",
    "this indicates that although he ii @xmath321640 is not detected in our composite spectrum , the derived upper limit is insufficient yet to rule out the existence of pop iii ( or very metal - poor ) stars in our laes at @xmath1 @xmath2 4.5 .",
    "considering the fraction of pop iii galaxies among lae sample at @xmath1 @xmath50 4.5 could be rather small ( such as a few percent , e.g. scannapieco , schneider & ferrara 2003 ) , the derived upper limit can not even rule out some model which predict comparable he ii @xmath321640 and ly@xmath3 line fluxes for pop iii populations ( e.g. tumlinson et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we have presented a large spectroscopically confirmed lae sample at @xmath1 @xmath2 4.5 . in this section",
    "we present the ly@xmath3 luminosity function based on this sample .",
    "due to the large uncertainty in flux calibration in spectroscopic observations , we adopt photometric measurements to calculate the ly@xmath3 fluxes .",
    "the ly@xmath3 fluxes were derived from narrowband and broadband photometry , where @xmath63 = @xmath64 - @xmath65*@xmath66 and @xmath65 = ( @xmath67-@xmath64)/(@xmath68-@xmath66 ) .",
    "the line luminosities of the confirmed laes were calculated assuming a cosmology model of h0 = 71 km / s / mpc , @xmath69 = 0.27 and @xmath70 = 0.73 .    for each confirmed lae , we first calculated the comoving volume @xmath71 over which the source could be selected by our survey from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , which are 4.36 and 4.65 respectively through band ha0 to band ha16 .",
    "the survey area is 35  @xmath12 35 .",
    "effects of different flux limits in narrow bands were also taken into account .",
    "we show the incompleteness of our spectroscopical observations in fig .",
    "[ fraction ] . in the figure we plot the fraction of spectroscopically targeted laes as a function of ly@xmath3 line flux .",
    "such incompleteness was taken into account while calculating the luminosity function . to be conservative",
    ", we assume that all the spectroscopically non - detected sources are not laes .    the derived ly@xmath3 luminosity function of laes at @xmath1 @xmath2 4.5 is plotted in fig .",
    "following malhotra & rhoads ( 2004 ) , we fit the luminosity function with a schechter function @xmath74 during the fit , we fixed the slope @xmath3 at -1.5 since our data is insufficient to have it constrained .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath75 erg s@xmath53 and @xmath76 mpc@xmath77 .",
    "considering the large uncertainties in the measurements and differences in ly@xmath3 emitting galaxies selection criteria among different research groups , the best - fitted @xmath78 and @xmath79 are consistent with the range of values found in various surveys at @xmath80 ( see the lower panel in fig .",
    "we have presented the largest spectroscopic sample of @xmath0  emitting galaxies yet studied . examining the properties of this sample , we reach several conclusions : + ( 1 )",
    "large equivalent width  emitters , which we have earlier reported as a common feature of narrowband - selected samples ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) , are spectroscopically confirmed at the same rate as less spectacular line emitters .",
    "thus , the high equivalent width sample is not dominated by noise spikes . nor can the large equivalent widths be solely a byproduct of calculating the ew using the same broad band data employed in candidate selection , because our large ew subsample changes little when we calculate ew using an independent broad band image completely independent of object selection .",
    "\\(2 ) the civ 1549  line is ( on average ) @xmath81 of the   line strength , placing an upper limit of @xmath82 on the agn fraction in the  selected sample .",
    "this limit is independent of the x - ray to  ratio in agn and therefore complements earlier limits on the agn fraction based on x - ray photometry .",
    "\\(3 ) the heii 1640  line is @xmath83 of the  line strength .",
    "this is the most stringent limit to date on the heii emission from these objects .",
    "though it does not strongly rule out many population iii models yet , it is nearly deep enough to do so and could be combined with a few similarly sized samples in future .",
    "\\(4 ) we present a new  luminosity function , based on a large spectroscopic data set at @xmath0 . allowing for differences in  galaxy selection criteria among different research groups , this luminosity function remains broadly consistent with others over the range @xmath80 .",
