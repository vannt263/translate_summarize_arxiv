    "lead ( pb ) is one kind of heavy metal element with widespread availability .",
    "single crystal pb is extremely resistant to oxygen @xcite .",
    "appreciable oxidation takes place only at relatively high temperature ( @xmath1370k ) or at considerable oxygen coverage at room temperature .",
    "however , this inoxidability of lead can be overcome by a so - called two - step treatment @xcite : ( i ) low temperature ( 100k ) adsorption , followed by ( ii ) annealing at elevated temperatures to above 220k .",
    "the method itself proves to be a very effective way for low - temperature surface oxidation . using this two - step approach , recently , the oxygen adsorption on ultra - thin pb(111 ) films",
    "was experimentally investigated by using the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was found that the surface oxidation displays a prominent quantum oscillating effect by varying the thickness of pb(111 ) film .",
    "furthermore , it was found that the o adsorbates can form some magic clusters with regular size and shape @xcite .",
    "these phenomena of the oxygen adsorption and surface oxidation at pb(111 ) remain yet to be exploited and understood , which is a main driving force for our present first - principles study .",
    "contrary to the extensive first - principles studies of the surface oxidation on transition metals ( tms ) such as cu @xcite ,  ag @xcite , rh @xcite , pd @xcite , pt @xcite , and ru @xcite , and on the simple @xmath2 metals such as al @xcite and mg @xcite , _ ab initio _ studies of oxygen chemisorption on pb(111 ) surface , in particular , o subsurface species on pb(111 ) surface , are still lacking .    in this paper",
    ", we have carried out the first - principles calculations of the on - surface and the subsurface o adsorption at pb(111 ) in a wide range of coverages .",
    "results for the determination of stable adsorption sites , work - function and atomic - relaxation changes , charge densities , electronic structures , and energy barriers for o diffusion and penetration , are systematically presented . like the other metals ,",
    "the surface oxidation of pb is expected to involve three main events : ( i ) the initial dissociation of o@xmath3 molecules and the oxygen chemisorption on pb(111 ) surface , followed by ( ii ) lattice penetration of atomic oxygen and oxide nucleation , and finally ( iii ) the crystallization and growth of the stoichiometric oxide phases .",
    "the sequence of these events may be complex , and rather than successively , they may occur simultaneously , depending on the temperature and pressure .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give a partial but detailed understanding of events ( i ) and ( ii ) by studying the energetics and structures of atomic o adsorbates with purely on - surface and subsurface adsorption sites and with different coverages .",
    "a full study involving the initial dissociation of o@xmath3 molecules when approaching to or accumulating on the pb(111 ) surface , and the penetration process which involves simultaneous on - surface and sub - surface adsorption , will be given elsewhere .",
    "in particular , since the atomic oxygen adsorption and diffusion on metal surface are elementary processes towards the whole surface oxidation , and the atomic configuration after the oxygen chemisorption may give a reasonable foresee for the tendency of bulk oxidation , it is expected that the present systematic first - principles calculations of the oxygen adsorption on pb(111 ) is of highly interest in relation to understanding the nature of the o - pb bond in general and of great necessity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii  we give details of the first - principles total energy calculations , which is followed in sec .",
    "iii by our results for bulk pb , the clean pb(111 ) surface , and the o@xmath3 molecule .",
    "the results for purely on - surface adsorption as a function of the oxygen coverage are presented in sec .",
    "iv , where the surface and adsorption energetics , the atomic geometry , and the electronic structures are presented and analyzed . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the purely subsurface adsorption of oxygen atoms as we did in sec .",
    "the energy barriers for atomic oxygen diffusion and penetration are presented in sec .",
    "vi , and the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "the density - functional theory ( dft ) total energy calculations were carried out using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package @xcite with the projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite and plane waves @xcite . in the present film calculations ,",
    "the so - called _ repeated slab _ geometries were employed @xcite .",
    "this scheme consists in the construction of a unit cell of an arbitrarily fixed number of atomic layers identical to that of the bulk in the plane of the surface ( defining the bi - dimensional cell ) , but symmetrically terminated by an arbitrarily fixed number of empty layers ( the _ vacuum _ ) along the direction perpendicular to the surface . in the present study , the clean pb(111 ) surface is modeled by periodic slabs consisting of ten lead layers separated by a vacuum of 20 , which is found to be sufficiently convergent .",
    "the oxygen atoms are adsorbed on both sides of the slab in a symmetric way . during our calculations ,",
    "the positions of the outmost three lead layers as well as the o atoms are allowed to relax while the central four layers of the slab are fixed in their calculated bulk positions .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff was set 400 ev . if not mentioned differently we have used a @xmath4 @xmath5-point grid for the p@xmath6 surface cell , @xmath7 @xmath5-point grid for the p@xmath8 and p@xmath9 cells , and @xmath10 @xmath5-point grid for the p@xmath11 cell , with monkhorse - pack scheme @xcite .",
    "the use of larger @xmath5-point meshes did not alter these values significantly .",
    "furthermore , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew _",
    "et al_. @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential was employed .",
    "a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.05 ev was chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around @xmath12 by a finite-@xmath13 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath14 k.        in the present paper , the calculations for oxygen atoms in the five adsorption sites , including on - surface ( hcp and fcc ) and subsurface ( tetra - i , tetra - ii , and octa ) sites depicted in fig . 1 , have been performed for coverage ranging from 0.11 ml to a full monolayer .",
    "specially , the oxygen coverages of 0.11 ml , 0.33 ml , and 0.67 ml were calculated using p@xmath11  surface unit cell , while the coverages of 0.25 ml , 0.50 ml , 0.75 ml , and 1.0 ml  were calculated in the p@xmath9 surface cell containing one , two , three , and four oxygen atoms , respectively .",
    "the on - surface top ( t1 ) and the bridge ( b2 ) adsorption sites were also considered .",
    "the t1 site was found to be notably less favorable than the fcc and hcp sites . when the o atom is placed on the b2 site",
    ", it always moves to the fcc site after relaxation .",
    "actually , figure 15 below will show that the b2 site is a saddle point in the o diffusion path from hcp to fcc site .",
    "thus in this paper , most of the on - surface adsorption studies are focused on the fcc and hcp sites .",
    "one central quantity tailored for the present study is the average binding energy of the adsorbed oxygen atom defined as @xmath15 , \\tag{2}%\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the total number of o atoms ( on - surface and subsurface ) present in the supercell at the considered coverage @xmath17 ( we define @xmath17 as the ratio of the number of adsorbed atoms to the number of atoms in an ideal substrate layer ) .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  are the total energies of the slab containing oxygen , of the corresponding clean pb(111 ) slab , and of a free o atom respectively . according to this definition , @xmath21 is also the adsorption energy @xmath22 per o atom , i.e. , the energy that a free o atom gains upon its adsorption .",
    "thus a positive value of @xmath21 indicates that the adsorption is exothermic ( stable ) with respect to a free o atom and a negative value indicates endothermic ( unstable ) reaction . on the other hand , since in most cases , the oxygen chemisorption process inevitably involves the dissociation of o@xmath3 molecules , thus the adsorption energy per oxygen atom can alternatively be referenced to the energy which the o atom has in the o@xmath3 molecule by subtracting half the dissociation energy @xmath23 of the o@xmath3 molecule , @xmath24 with this choice of adsorption energy , then a positive value indicates that the dissociative adsorption of o@xmath3  is an exothermic process , while a negative value indicates that it is endothermic and that it is energetically more favorable for oxygen to be in the gas phase as o@xmath3 .",
    "first the total energy of the bulk fcc pb was calculated to obtain the bulk lattice constant . the calculated lattice constant is @xmath25=5.028 , comparable well with experimental values of 4.95 @xcite .",
    "the 6@xmath26 and 6@xmath27 electrons of the pb atom were treated as the valence electrons and the 5@xmath28 electrons were treated as core electrons .",
    "this choice of valence and core electrons has been previously employed to study the electronic properties of lead oxide ( including pbo @xcite and pbo@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "note that we have also studied the effect of pb 5d electrons on the surface properties of clean and oxygen - adsorbed pb(111 ) surface and found no accountable changes by treating the pb 5d electrons as valence electrons @xcite .",
    "the orbital - resolved electronic density of states ( dos ) per atom for the bulk pb is shown in fig .",
    "the two broad peaks correspond to pb 6@xmath26 and 6@xmath27 states .",
    "compared to the 6@xmath26 band , the 6@xmath27 bands are more dispersive due to the extensive character of the atomic @xmath27 orbitals .",
    "in addition , there is a small @xmath26-@xmath27 hybridization near the fermi energy .",
    "pb(111 ) surface layer .",
    "the fermi energy is indicated by the vertical dashed line at 0 ev . ]",
    "the calculation for the atomic relaxations of the clean surface p@xmath6 , p@xmath8 , p@xmath9 , and p@xmath11  periodicities ( models ) , provides not only a test of the clean surface with different cell sizes , but is also used to evaluate the charge density difference used later and assess the changes in the work function by the o adsorption .",
    "our clean - surface calculations show that the two outmost pb(111 ) layers relax significantly from the bulk values , namely , the first - second layer contraction is nearly 5% and the second - third layer expansion is nearly 3% , in agreement with the recent results from first - principles calculations @xcite and the leed experiment @xcite .",
    "note that the first interlayer separation on most metal surfaces is contracted , pb(111 ) is also a typical example .",
    "the third - forth layer distance is practically the same as the interlayer distance in the bulk .",
    "the variation of the work function is negligible for different surface cells [ with a value of 3.83 ev , see the inset in fig .",
    "7(a ) below ] and is in excellent agreement with the other theoretical result @xcite .",
    "the charge density @xmath29 ( not depicted here ) shows that like the other typical surface calculations @xcite , there is a rapid variation in @xmath29 in the surface interstitial region , with @xmath29 falling off sharply in magnitude towards the vacuum and soon healing  the discrete atomic nature of the surface .",
    "this sizable charge redistribution near the surface is associated with the formation of the ( uniform ) surface dipole layer , which sensitively determines the work function .",
    "as one knows , surface calculations are very subtle , requiring enough @xmath5-point mesh and efficient energy cutoff , the correct model , and the other details . to test the convergency of the physical properties of the clean pb(111 ) surface , we have calculated and analyzed the interlayer relaxations @xmath30=@xmath31 with respect to the bulk interlayer distance @xmath32=2.903  , the surface energy @xmath33 , and the work function @xmath34 of the clean pb(111 ) films by using different models with various @xmath5-points mesh .",
    "the results for different models are listed in table i , from which it reveals that while the atomic interlayer relaxations are somewhat sensitive to the choice of @xmath5-points mesh and the model , the influences to the surface energetics from using different models are negligibly small .",
    "we suggest to analyze the surface energetics and electronic structures under the calculations of the same model , since the required high accuracy is expected to obtain by using the same surface model to do more reliable calculations and comparisons .",
    "for example , a p@xmath11 surface unit cell is needed if one wants to analyze the properties of surface chemical activity  in a coverage range beginning  from @xmath17=0.11 .",

    "4 that the adsorption of oxygen on pb(111 ) induces notable changes in the interlayer distances of the substrate for the whole coverages considered . in particular , the topmost interlayer relaxation ( @xmath35 ) changes from contraction ( about @xmath595% )  to expansion ( about 20% ) , and on the contrary , the second interlayer relaxation ( @xmath36 ) changes from expansion ( about 3% )  to contraction ( about @xmath595% ) , for o in both fcc and hcp sites .",

    "it can be seen from table ii that the most preferred adsorption site is tetra - ii site for the whole coverage range and among all the on - surface and subsurface adsorption sites considered .",

    "7(a)-(b ) it can be seen that the amplitude of @xmath62 for the tetra - ii adsorption is most prominent among the three subsurface sties .",

    "figures 13(a)-(b ) ( right panel in each figure ) present the contour plots of @xmath64 for @xmath17=0.25 and @xmath17=1.0 , respectively , for the tetra - ii subsurface adsorption .",

    "since there is no electron density accumulation in the o - pb bondng regions , we obtain an ionic - like bonding picture for the subsurface o atom , with charge transfer and polarization . the subsurface accumulation and",
    "the on - surface depletion in the charge density would result in the formation of a dipole moment ( anti - paralleling with the usual surface dipole layer ) which tends to reduce the work function as compared to that for the clean pb(111 ) surface , as shown in fig .",

    "14(b ) ] , there are the following new features : ( i ) the pdos shifts downwards in energy and a large spectra weight near the fermi energy ( from below ) becomes very small , both of which obviously will lead to the increase in the adsorption energy ; ( ii ) the coupling between the o-2@xmath27 and pb-2@xmath26 states comes to play an important role in the o - pb bond . due to the difference in the coordinates of the neighboring pb atoms ,",

    "14(b ) ; ( iv ) compared to the high - coverage on - surface adsorption [ fig .",
    "9(b ) ] , the narrowing effect of the pb-2@xmath26 dos by the coupling with o-2@xmath27 states is not prominent so much .",
    "the diffusion of the atomic o after the on - surface dissociation of the o@xmath3 molecule is an elementary process during the whole surface oxidation process , which is still in debate for many systems regarding the existence of hot  atoms with transient mobility upon o@xmath3 dissociation @xcite . also , the oxygen diffusion plays a key role in understanding many important catalytic reactions , such as oxidation of co and hydrocarbons in the catalytic treatment of the automotive exhaust gases . in this section , by using the dft total energy calculation , we report our numerical results of  the energy barriers for atomic o diffusion and penetration in the o / pb(111 ) system .     and ( b ) @xmath66 . here",

    "15(a ) for low ( @xmath17=0.25 ) coverage and in fig .",
    "15(b ) for high ( @xmath0=1.0 ) coverage . note that in each figure [ fig .",
    "15(a ) or ( b ) ] the number of atoms keeps invariant in the on - surface and subsurface calculations .",
    "thus it also reveals in fig .",
    "15 the relative stability of o adsorption among various on - surface and subsurface sites and the corresponding oxygen binding energy differences . for the on - surface adsorption , our calculated diffusion barrier from fcc to hcp site is 0.52 ev at @xmath17=0.25 and 0.74 ev at @xmath17=1.0 .",

    "15 shows that all of the three sites we considered , i.e. , the tetra - i , the tetra - ii and the octa sites present the local energy minimum along the oxygen subsurface diffusion path .",

    "@xmath26 coordinate indicates the penetration distance of the o atom with respect to the initial on - surface fcc or hcp adsorption site . ]    to investigate subsurface oxygen in more detail with regard to the energetics of its formation , we now study the penetration process of oxygen atom .",
    "note that although the subsurface tetra - ii site is most stable , the direct oxygen penetration into this site from the on - surface adsorption without by - passing the other subsurface sites is very unfavorable , since this site is located below a surface pb atom .",
    "therefore , here we only consider the penetration of o atom through the outmost pb layer from the on - surface fcc ( hcp ) to the neighboring subsurface octa ( tetra - i ) site at the coverage @xmath17=0.25 . for this purpose , we fully relaxed the first three pb layers , and restrain the oxygen atom when approaching to the first pb layer step by step to search for the transition state with high energy .",
    "the calculated penetration paths and the energy barriers from the on - surface fcc to subsurface octa site and from the on - surface hcp to subsurface tetra - i site are shown in fig .",
    "16 , in which the @xmath26 coordinate indicates the penetration distance of the o atom with respect to the initial on - surface fcc or hcp adsorption site . the calculated penetration barrier from on - surface fcc to subsurface octa site is 0.352 ev .",
    "the transition state , i.e. , the atomic geometry of the energy maximum in the penetration path , corresponds to the oxygen atom 0.1 above the surface pb layer . for penetration from the on - surface hcp to the subsurface tetra - i site",
    ", the calculated activation barrier is as small as 0.065 ev , which implies the most favorable path for the oxygen penetration .",
    "the transition state corresponds to the oxygen atom 0.4 below the surface pb layer .",
    "comparing to the energy barriers for the o on - surface diffusion , one can see that the oxygen atoms can easily intrude into the subsurface and bond with the second - layer pb atoms rather than searching for a more stable on - surface site ( fcc site ) to settle down .",
    "even though an oxygen atom settles down at the stable on - surface fcc site , it also can penetrate into the subsurface stimulated by a slight perturbation .",
    "in summary , we have systematically investigated the adsorption of atomic oxygen on the pb(111 ) surface and subsurface , as well as the energy barriers for atomic o diffusion and penetration in these systems through first - principles dft - gga calculations .",
    "we considered a wide range of coverage using different surface models [ i.e. , p@xmath11 , p@xmath9 , p@xmath8 , and p@xmath6  surface unit cells ] for adsorption in the on - surface fcc and hcp sites as well as the subsurface tetra - i , tetra - ii , and octa sites .",
    "for the on - surface adsorption , the fcc site is more stable than the hcp site for the whole coverage range considered .",
    "the oxygen binding energy difference between these two sites decreases with increasing coverage .",
    "in particular , at the coverage of 1 ml , the binding energy of o@xmath54 is almost identical from below to that of o@xmath53 , implying a critical coverage for the stability conversion between the on - surface fcc and hcp sites . the atomic geometry ,",
    "the work - function change , the charge density distribution , and the electronic structure upon the o  on - surface adsorption have also been studied , which consistently show the fundamental influence by the ionic bonding between the o atom and the first - layer pb atoms with charge transfer from the latter to the former .",
    "remarkably , this influence in the energetics and atomic structure is monotonically enhanced with increasing the o coverage , which is highly interesting .",
    "for instance , the increase of the o binding energy for the fcc or the hcp site with increasing the coverage implies the effective attraction between the o adsorbates , which will make it favorable for the formation of the oxygen island or cluster .",
    "furthermore , we have found that with increasing coverage , the electronic pdos at the fermi energy rapidly decreases , which will further stabilize the system in accordance with the increase in binding energy .    for the purely subsurface o adsorption ,",
    "the tetra - ii site is more stable than the tetra - i and octa sites for the whole coverage range considered .",
    "a similar correlation between the binding energy and the coverage has been found for o@xmath79 and o@xmath80 , which also implies the effective attraction between the adsorbed o atoms and the tendency to form the oxygen island or cluster at subsurface sites .",
    "the other atomic and electronic structural properties of the subsurface adsorption have also been investigated .",
    "the observed increase of the first - second pb interlayer expansion , the decrease of the work - function change @xmath62 , and the decrease of the pdos at the fermi energy as functions of the o coverage , consistently show the stabilization of the ionic o - pb bond with the charge transfer from the first- and second - layer pb atoms to the subsurface o atom .    given the observation that the oxygen atom is more stable for the subsurface than for the on - surface adsorption , we have calculated the on - surface and subsurface diffusion - path energetics of o. the activation barrier for the on - surface or the subsurface o diffusion becomes high when increasing the coverage , which indicates the competition between the attractive interaction from the adsorbate and the substrate and the repulsive force among the adsorbates .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the activation barrier for the penetration from the on - surface hcp to the subsurface tetra - i site is as low as 0.065 ev , which indicates that the oxygen atoms can directly incorporate into the lead ( below the topmost pb layer ) right after on - surface o@xmath3 dissociation at low coverage rather than nearly completion of a dense o adlayer .",

    "<S> the on - surface and subsurface diffusion - path energetics of atomic oxygen , and the activation barriers for the o penetration from the on - surface to the subsurface sites are presented at low and high coverages . in particular , it is shown that the penetration barrier from the on - surface hcp to the subsurface tetra - i site is as small as 65 mev at low coverage ( @xmath0=0.25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other properties of the o / pb(111 ) system , including the charge distribution , the lattice relaxation , the work function , and the electronic density of states , are also studied and discussed in detail , which consistently show the gradually stabilizing ionic o - pb bond with increase of the oxygen coverage . </S>"
