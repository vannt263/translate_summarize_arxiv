    "predictions for the dominant  and  amplitudes translate into branching fractions at a level of one to few times @xmath26 .",
    "we are therefore in a position to provide first experimental tests of theoretical predictions for absolute  @xcite , as well as ratios of branching fractions  @xcite .",
    "many authors have proposed to use charmless hadronic @xmath5  decays to probe the ckm sector of the standard model .",

    "the hadronic cross section for continuum production of u , d , s , or c quark anti - quark pairs is about a factor of 3 higher than that for @xmath29 .",

    "the momenta of charged particles is measured in a tracking system consisting of a 6-layer straw tube chamber , a 10-layer precision drift chamber , and a 51-layer main drift chamber , all operating inside a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid .",

    "two kinematic variables , @xmath38   are used to form a two dimensional signal plus sideband region . using the beam energy in @xmath39   improves the mass resolution by an order of magnitude , resulting in @xmath40mev .    the main continuum background suppression is obtained by requiring @xmath41 .",
    "the angle @xmath42  here is the angle between the candidate axis and the sphericity axis of the rest of the event .",
    "candidate @xmath5  daughters from continuum background tend to be the leading particles in two back to back 5  gev `` jets '' .",
    "background therefore peaks towards @xmath43 .",
    "signal is flat in @xmath44  as the two @xmath5 s are approximately at rest in the labframe , leading to uncorrelated directions for the decay products .",
    "this difference in `` event shape '' between @xmath1  signal and continuum background is exploited further using a fisher discriminant technique ( @xmath45 ) described in detail in ref .",

    "additional cuts are applied to suppress backgrounds in these plots .",

    "we have measured the branching fractions for exclusive @xmath5  decays to the final states @xmath58  and @xmath59 .",
    "all three of these are @xmath60  transitions .",
    "it is very instructive to compare the square root of the three measured branching fractions with each other , as well as the diagrams that are expected to contribute . for simplicity",
    "we ignore diagrams that are expected to be suppressed by @xmath61 . for completeness",
    ", we have also listed the upper limits in @xmath62  and the central value from the fit in @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64    the amplitude @xmath65  enters due to @xmath66  mixing .",

    "we have followed ref .",
    "@xcite in our choice of mixing angle of @xmath67 . for this choice of @xmath68",
    "there is no flavor octet contribution  in @xmath69 .",
    "varying this angle within its known range  @xcite makes no difference to the general arguments presented here .",
    "the branching fraction in @xmath70  sets the scale by providing a direct measurement of the  amplitude .",
    "measured branching fractions and upper limits for all other @xmath57   transitions are consistent with being dominated by the measured  amplitude .",
    "in particular , we see no need to invoke a @xmath71 or glueball component , nor anomalous coupling of two gluons to @xmath32 in order to explain the relative size of these branching fractions  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of absolute branching fractions have large uncertainties due to factorization hypothesis and poorly known form factors . keeping that in mind , theoretical predictions   @xcite  of @xmath72   agree surprisingly well with our experimental result .",
    "let us look at eq .",
    "( 2 ) in some more detail . to @xmath73 ,",
    "the only non - trivial weak phases in the ckm - matrix are those of @xmath74  and @xmath75 .",
    "the relative weak phase between  and  for @xmath57  transitions is thus the phase of @xmath74 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath76   may therefore provide constraints on the poorly known phase of @xmath74  as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ratio of flavor singlet to flavor octet gluonic penguin diagrams @xmath77  is rather difficult to estimate theoretically . neglecting  and",
    ", we find that our current upper limit on @xmath78  is consistent with the naive expectation of @xmath79 .",
    "this may provide a more stringent limit on @xmath80  as we increase our data set . similarly , a significant discrepancy between the ratio of branching fractions for @xmath81  and @xmath82  may in the future provide a lower limit on @xmath83@xmath83 .",
    "construction of an amplitude quadrangle for these modes may in certain cases even provide information on the relative phases of these amplitudes .",
    "while we do see some excess of events above background in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the respective statistical significance of @xmath87  and @xmath88  is quite marginal .",
    "both of these decay modes are expected to be dominated by simple external w - emission ( ) diagrams .",
    "factorization may therefore be less questionable here than in the @xmath60  transitions discussed above .    using the cleo measurement @xmath89  @xcite   we can use the factorization hypothesis , isgw ii , and the qcd factor @xmath90  @xcite  to predict the branching fractions @xmath91  and @xmath92   respectively  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the formfactor and factorization hypothesis are not reflected in the errors quoted here .",
    "furthermore , contributions from anything other than the diagram are neglected in this kind of comparison . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we conclude that the central value from the fit to the experimental data as shown in table  [ tab : results ] compares well with these predictions .",
    "we do not see any evidence for @xmath93  or @xmath94 .",
    "the dominant contributions to these decays are due to ( @xmath95 ) , and  respectively .",
    "the penguin diagrams in both cases are @xmath19  penguins .",
    "theoretical predictions for these modes range from less than @xmath96  to few times @xmath25@xcite .",
    "finally , we see no evidence for @xmath97 .",
    "this is not surprising as this decay can only proceed via  or  diagrams .",
    "theoretical predictions for this process are at the level of at most a few times @xmath98@xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that an overall consistent picture of charmless hadronic @xmath5  decays to two pseudoscalar mesons is starting to emerge .",
    "cleo has measured the dominant @xmath99  transitions at levels consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "no signals are found in any of the decay modes that are expected to be suppressed .",
