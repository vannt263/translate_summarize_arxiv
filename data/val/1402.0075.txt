    "the basic picture of galaxy formation and evolution in the cosmological context can be explained in the standard @xmath1 cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology .",
    "particularly , large scale clustering properties and formation and evolution of dark matter halos can reliably be predicted by the theory of gravity .",
    "however , in order to obtain the full picture of cosmological galaxy formation , we must solve complicated processes of baryonic physics , such as gas cooling , star formation , feedback , galaxy mergers , and so on .",
    "one of the key observables about galaxies that must be explained by the theory of cosmological galaxy formation is the luminosity functions ( lfs ) and their evolution .",
    "compared with the shape of dark matter halo mass function predicted by the @xmath1cdm cosmology , the observed galaxy lfs have two remarkable features : flatter faint - end slopes and sharp exponential cut - off at the luminous / massive end ( see benson et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) , which must be explained by some baryonic processes .",
    "a widely accepted solution to achieve a flat faint end is supernova feedback , i.e. , energy input into the interstellar medium by supernova explosions to suppress star formation in small galaxies .",
    "however , the problem is not yet completely solved at the quantitative level .",
    "in fact , unreasonably high efficiency of supernova feedback to remove cold interstellar gas in dwarf galaxies is necessary in many existing theoretical models to reproduce the observed flat faint ends , and such an extreme supernova feedback tends to produce discrepancies with observations other than luminosity function shapes ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 , hereafter ny04 ; nagashima et al .",

    "2011 ; wang , weinmann & neistein 2012 ; mutch , poole & croton 2013 ; puchwein & springel 2013 ; hopkins et al .",
    "these results imply that another physical effect may also be taking an important role to produce the observed flat faint end slopes .    for the massive end ,",
    "a popular solution to suppress the formation of too massive galaxies is the feedback by active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , bower et al .",
    "2006 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; menci et al .",
    "2008 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; guo et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the agn feedback can also explain the observed trends of the early appearance of massive and quiescent galaxies at high redshifts , and downsizing of star - forming galaxies from high to low redshifts , which are apparently in contradiction with the simple expectation in the @xmath1cdm universe ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "2006 ; somerville et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , there are large uncertainties about the physics of agn feedback both in theoretically and observationally .",
    "the current success in explaining the observed trends by this process is based on rather phenomenological modelings including highly uncertain parameters , and further studies are required to confirm the quantitative influence of this process on galaxy evolution .",
    "therefore it is still worth to explore yet other physical effects working to shape galaxy lfs , which is the aim of this paper .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that such an effect would be manifested in the scaling laws about star formation efficiency .",
    "the relation between the surface densities of star formation rate ( sfr ) and gas ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) has been a subject of intensive research .",
    "it is popular to fit this relation by a power - law ( so - called kennicutt - schmidt law , kennicutt 1998 ) , but recent observations indicate a cut - off around the total ( i.e. , + h@xmath4 ) gas density of @xmath5 , under which sfr is suppressed and not well correlated with gas density .",
    "this threshold gas density for sfr can be interpreted as a result of less efficient formation of cold molecular gas under the threshold , while the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) from molecular gas is rather universal in many different environments ( wong & blitz 2002 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "2007 ; bigiel et al . 2008 , 2010 ; leroy et al . 2008",
    "; blanc et al . 2009 ; heiderman et al . 2010 ; lada et al .",
    "2010 , schruba et al . 2011",
    "; see kennicutt & evans 2012 and schruba 2013 for reviews ) .",
    "a likely physical origin of the suppression of h@xmath4 formation under the threshold is radiative feedback by uv photons produced by young massive stars ( schaye 2004 ; krumholz , mckee & tumlinson 2008 , 2009 ; mckee & krumholz 2010 ; hopkins et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the formation of h@xmath4 is driven by collisionally excited metal line cooling and molecule formation on dust grain surfaces , which should be balanced with molecule dissociations by uv photons and grain photoelectric heating , both of which are energetically supplied by uv radiation field . if a region in a galaxy is optically thick to uv radiation field by dust grains , self - shielding of uv radiation would accelerate h@xmath4 formation .",
    "this implies that the more fundamental threshold about star formation is not the total gas surface density but dust opacity . for a typical dust - to - gas ratio ,",
    "the observationally indicated threshold in @xmath3 is close to the value at which the effective dust opacity @xmath6 becomes of order unity , where @xmath6 is averaged over wavelength with a weight of the heating radiation energy spectrum ( totani et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "therefore it is physically reasonable to expect that a galaxy - scale mean value of @xmath6 has an important role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a further observational support to this picture comes from infrared observations .",
    "the relations between dust temperature , galaxy size , and infrared luminosity of @xmath71,000 nearby star - forming galaxies indicate that almost all of them are in the optically thick regime , and the distribution of dust opacity estimated by gas - phase metal column density suddenly drops around @xmath8 , indicating less efficient formation of galaxies at @xmath9 ( totani et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the radiative feedback depend on dust opacity , on cosmological galaxy formation and evolution particularly about the shape of galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "the theory of structure formation in the universe predicts that the mean surface density @xmath10 of dark halos with mass @xmath11 and size @xmath12 nearly scales as @xmath13 , indicating higher gas surface density and dust opacity at higher redshifts in more massive objects , and hence more efficient star formation .",
    "this may have a favorable effect to explain observations , in a similar way to the feedbacks by supernovae and agns .    to investigate the effect quantitatively",
    ", we use a semi - analytic model ( sam ) of cosmological galaxy formation , _ the mitaka model _ ( ny04 ) .",
    "this is a model similar to general sams , in which formation and evolution of dark matter halos are solved analytically or calculated by n - body simulations , while complicated baryonic processes are treated phenomenologically ( for reviews , see baugh 2006 ; benson 2010 ) . in general",
    ", sams has many adjustable parameters and the effects of complicated physical processes on the lfs are degenerate ( e.g. , neistein & weinmann 2010 ) ; therefore a set of best - fit parameters may not be a quantitatively correct description of real galaxy formation .",
    "it should be noted that the most important aim of this work is to examine the qualitative effects of the new feedback on luminosity functions .    in most of the sams ,",
    "the star formation rate is simply proportional to cold gas mass , and the star formation time scale is modeled as a simple function of the dynamical time scale of galaxy disks or dm halos ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "2000 ; ny04 ) . some models ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; lagos et al . 2011 ; wang et al .",
    "2012 ) incorporated the threshold of gas surface density below which star formation activity is significantly suppressed . in the models of kauffmann ( 1996 ) , croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and lagos et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , they introduced the threshold of gas surface density motivated by the toomre stability criterion on a galactic scale ( toomre 1964 ) . in this scenario the threshold of gas surface density increases with redshift , and hence the threshold effect should be systematically different in the cosmological context from the threshold by dust opacity considered in this paper .",
    "furthermore , some recent observations indicate that star formation are controlled by the physical state of local interstellar gas , rather than the dynamical state of an entire galaxy ( e.g. , leroy et al .",
    "2008 ; lada et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in other models , such as somerville et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , a critical gas surface density threshold for star formation is introduced motivated from the observations of the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation ; however , to our knowledge there are no sams that consider a feedback depending on dust surface density rather than gas density .",
    "recently krumholz & dekel ( 2012 ) incorporated a star formation law which depends on gas surface density and gas metallicity , and discussed average evolution of typical galaxies without calculating detailed merger histories of dark halos .",
    "the relation between the luminosity function shapes and the dust opacity threshold of star formation has not yet been discussed in previous studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we will describe our model particularly focusing on the modelings of star formation and feedback .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] , we show the results of our model , and section [ sec : gasmodel ] is devoted for discussion . we will summarize our work in section [ sec : summary ] . in this work ,",
