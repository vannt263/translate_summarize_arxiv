    "( 1991 , p.  280 ) .",
    "their identification of this source as extragalactic was based on its compact morphology and flux density of  0.58  jy at  0.33  ghz .",
    "this extragalactic classification was further strengthened by  8.5 and  15  ghz observations by w.  m.  goss & k.  r.  anantharamaiah  ( 1990 , unpublished ) showing the source to have a fanaroff - riley  ii radio galaxy morphology with a 4  separation between components .",
    "based on  0.33 and  1.4  ghz images of the source , lazio & cordes  ( 1998a ) pointed out that the source could not be extragalactic _ and _ affected by the hyperstrong scattering region responsible for the enhanced angular broadening of  and the oh masers .",
    "they suggested that the source might be an x - ray  quiet version of a galactic jet source , like 1e1740.7@xmath122942 ( @xcite ) .",
    "yusef - zadeh , cotton , & reynolds  ( 1998a ) have recently considered a number of classifications for the source including young supernova remnant , radio supernova , or nova remnant , based on high - resolution , total intensity images at  15  ghz and polarized intensity images at  5  ghz .",

    "this difference arises because we use data solely from the a configuration while they used data from both a- and b configurations .",

    "the large width of the gas at  0  may be a blend of two components  one centered near  0  , the other near  @xmath22  .",

    "we have also been able to place crude limits on the distance to the source , which are consistent with it being extragalactic .",
    "the source clearly shows the morphology of an fr  ii source .",
    "our 1.5 and  8.5  ghz images ( figures  [ fig : lband ] and  [ fig : xband]b ) show two components ( a and  c ) surrounding a central component ( b ) , which we identify as the core of the source . our highest resolution , 15  ghz image ( figure  [ fig : uband ] ) resolves component  a into two sub - components , one of which is possibly an edge - brightened hot spot . at  8.5  ghz ,",
    "component  c is elongated in the direction toward component  b , and component  b has a steep - spectrum , jet - like feature pointed toward ( figure  [ fig : xband]a ) .",
    "the source is asymmetric ; the separation between components  a and  b is 4 , and the separation between components  b and  c is 9 .",
    "this asymmetry could reflect a number of effects : the orientation of the source with respect to the line of sight , inhomogeneities in the ambient medium , and precession of the jet . a denser medium surrounding component",
    "a might also explain why it is considerably brighter than .    within component",
    "a the line joining the two hot spots is oriented at an angle of approximately 70  to the line joining components  a .",
    "such misalignment is a common feature of fr  ii radio galaxies and is thought to result from changes in the jet orientation ( @xcite ) .      at frequencies higher than 1.5  ghz",

    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the spectra of the individual components and of the entire source , as derived from our measurements , and table  [ tab : fluxdensity ] tabulates the flux density of the components . over the frequency range 1.515  ghz , component  a has a spectral index of @xmath24 , component  b has a spectral index of @xmath25 , and , between  1.5 and  8.5  ghz , component  c has a spectral index of @xmath24 . at  15  ghz",
    "we can place only an upper limit ( @xmath26 ) of  0.24  mjy on the flux density of component  c , which is slightly lower than that expected by an extrapolation of its spectrum , namely 0.3  mjy .",
    "using anantharamaiah et al.s  ( 1991 ) value for the 0.33  ghz flux density of  0.58  jy and assuming that all three components contribute to the flux at  0.33  ghz , the spectrum flattens between  0.33 and  1.5  ghz with @xmath27 .    though our flux density measurements at different frequencies were obtained from observations with differing resolutions  with the exception of the 0.33  ghz observations (  [ sec : pband])the components are sufficiently compact that this should introduce little error . in order to verify that this is the case , we have compared flux density measurements made at  8.5  ghz , determined both with and without the 1990 observations .",
    "the lower resolution 1990 observations should be more sensitive to extended flux that might be missed in our higher resolution 1998 observations .",
    "we find that the flux density measurements , determined with and without the 1990 observations , agree to within 10% for both components  a .",
    "yusef - zadeh et al .  ( 1998a ) used matched resolution , nearly simultaneous observations to find @xmath28 and @xmath29 for components  a and  b , respectively , between  5 and  15  ghz .",
    "lazio & cordes  ( 1998a ) find @xmath30 for component  a over the frequency range 0.3315  ghz , though they used flux density measurements made at differing resolutions at different epochs and assumed that component  a was responsible for all of the flux at  0.33  ghz ( viz.[sec : image ] ) .",

    "is most likely to be a distant radio galaxy ; it does not have the morphology of a head - tail galaxy , both radio halos and fading radio galaxies are quite rare , and the lack of variation ( see below ) indicates that it is probably not galactic .",
    "in addition to its spectrum ,  has two other characteristics typical of uss , distant radio galaxies ( @xcite ) : first , the majority of uss sources consist of more than one component , with 10% being triples .",
    "second , the 12  separation between components  a and  c is comparable to the median angular size of uss radio sources  for uss radio sources having a 0.33  ghz flux density of 0.5  jy , the median angular size at  1.4  ghz is approximately 10 .",
    "an extrapolation of the high - frequency spectrum of  to  0.33  ghz predicts a flux density of  0.8  jy , in contrast to the observed value of of  0.58  jy ( @xcite ) . we can identify both intrinsic and extrinsic causes for such a high - frequency steepening of the source s spectrum .",
    "the intrinsic cause would be a depletion of the high - energy electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission .",
    "this depletion could result from effects such as inverse compton losses from the radiation field of the central engine ( e.g. , @xcite ) or from a higher cosmic background radiation field at earlier epochs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the extrinsic cause would be free - free absorption in the .",
    "an optical depth of @xmath31 at  0.33  ghz would be sufficient to account for this difference .",
    "optical depths @xmath32 at  0.33  ghz are seen elsewhere in the gc , e.g. , near the radio arch ( @xcite ) , and an extended , low - density region covers the inner degree or so of the gc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also  [ sec : imply ] ) . from our limited spectral coverage of the source s spectrum , however , we can not distinguish between these various possibilities .",
    "yusef - zadeh et al .  ( 1998a ) show that the edge - brightened areas in component  a are significantly polarized ( 616% ) at  5  ghz .",
    "this level of polarization is consistent with that seen in the lobes of fr  ii radio galaxies .    because of large faraday rotation",
    ", the intrinsic magnetic field direction within component  a can not be determined . from two closely spaced frequencies near  5  ghz , yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 1998a ) derive a faraday rotation measure of  3000  rad  m@xmath33 .",
    "comparable faraday rotation measures are seen along other lines of sight to the gc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; yusef - zadeh , wardle , & parastaran  1997 ) , and some fr  ii radio galaxies are embedded within a magnetized intracluster medium which could contribute to additional faraday rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations , combined with those summarized in lazio & cordes  ( 1998a ) , provide a 1015  yr time span over which  has been observed between  0.33 and  15  ghz . on short time scales ( between a few days to a month ) the source shows no structural variations , and the flux density is essentially constant .",
    "the angular resolution of many of the older observations ( @xcite ) was not as high as in the present observations , so that a detailed comparison of the structure of the source at different epochs is not possible .",
    "components  a and  b have been detected , at approximately the same angular separation from each other , since 1986 .",
    "flux density comparisons are also hampered by the differing resolutions at the various different epochs .",
    "nonetheless , the flux density of the source does not appear to have varied by more than 10% at any frequency over this this time span , and flux density variations of roughly 10% may be the result of ( extrinsic ) refractive scintillation ( rickett , coles , & bourgois  1984 ) .",
    "we can place only crude limits on the distance to , but these are consistent with it being extragalactic .",
    "the spectra of  and b1739@xmath12298 are similar : both are dominated by an absorption feature centered approximately on  0  , with a considerable width , 40  , and optical depth , @xmath34 . in both sources there is a suggestion that this large width is the superposition of two velocity components , one centered on 0  , the other at  @xmath22  .",
    "the 20  gas does not appear in the spectrum of  and presumably lies beyond it .",
    "the forbidden velocities near the gc make determining a distance from a rotation curve problematic , but the spectrum of  indicates that it is at least as far away as the gc and is consistent with an extragalactic distance .",

    "in contrast to its triple morphology at higher frequencies ,  consists of a single component at  0.33  ghz , approximately 20  in diameter .",
    "the structure of  at  0.33  ghz is due , in part , to radio - wave scattering .",
    "the alternative , that it reflects _ only _ the intrinsic structure of the source , seems unlikely .",
    "the high - frequency spectrum of , extrapolated to  0.33  ghz and combined with modest free - free absorption , can account for the flux density of (  [ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "if the 0.33  ghz structure is a halo , then the spectra of the individual components must flatten considerably or turn over below  1  ghz .",
    "while some spectral flattening is seen for uss sources , typically this occurs at frequencies below  0.1  ghz ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the halo would have to have a spectral index steeper than the individual components to avoid detection in our observations (  [ sec : observe ] ) and those of lazio & cordes  ( 1998a ) .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that a halo contributes to the 0.33  ghz structure , however .",
    "some fr  ii galaxies have low frequency halos that surround the lobes ( @xcite ) .",
    "a halo enclosing components  a and  c ( separation 12 ) would be largely resolved out by our observations ; such a halo could have also escaped detection in the observations summarized in lazio & cordes  ( 1998a ) , either because the previous observations were less sensitive than those reported here or because they did not have sufficient angular resolution .",
    "the uncertainty in the amount of free - free absorption along this line of sight also allows for the existence of a halo .",
    "we require an optical depth @xmath31 to reconcile the observed and expected flux densities (  [ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "an optical depth only slightly larger , @xmath44 , for instance , would permit a halo with a 0.33  ghz flux density @xmath45  jy to exist while remaining consistent with the observed flux density .",

    "in fact all three components will contribute to the 0.33  ghz structure .",
    "the observed diameter of a source at a particular frequency can be modelled as the quadrature sum of the intrinsic diameter and the scattering diameter .",
    "it is assumed commonly that scattering affects the apparent diameter of only relatively compact sources .",
    "however , if the scattering diameter is comparable to that of the intrinsic diameter , then the apparent diameter of the source will reflect the contribution from scattering , _ even if _ the intrinsic structure of the source is not compact ( @xcite ) .    in solving for the scattering diameter of , we shall obtain a range of allowed values because of our limited information about its intrinsic structure at  0.33  ghz .",
    "the observed diameter of at  0.33  ghz is 19 .",
    "we first obtain an upper limit on the scattering diameter by assuming that component  a , which dominates the flux density of the source at high frequencies , continues to dominate at  0.33  ghz .",

    "their diameters indicate that they are heavily scattered , though not affected by the hyperstrong region in front of ( @xcite ) .",
    "their scattering diameters , scaled to  0.33  ghz , are roughly 6 , only a factor of 23 smaller than that inferred for .",
    "the shape of the image at  0.33  ghz is also _",
    "irregular_. we characterize the image shape as irregular as opposed to anisotropic because the image displays a `` mottled '' or `` lumpy '' appearance ( figure  [ fig : overlay ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic structure , as inferred from the high frequency observations , contributes little to the irregular appearance .",
    "we have convolved our 1.5  ghz image ( figure  [ fig : lband ] ) with a circular gaussian scattering disk , 15  in diameter .",
    "the resulting image is comparable in size to that of our 0.33  ghz image , but is considerably smoother .",
    "our lack of knowledge about the low - frequency , intrinsic structure of  limits the extent to which we can explain this irregular appearance .",
    "this appearance is probably the result of both the intrinsic structure at  0.33  ghz and anisotropic scattering .",
    "observations at frequencies between  0.33 and  1.4  ghz would be useful in separating these effects . unfortunately , existing observations in this frequency range do not have sufficient angular resolution even to resolve the source ( e.g. , the 0.84  ghz most survey had a beam of @xmath50 , @xcite ) .      using a likelihood analysis of the oh maser scattering diameters and source counts of extragalactic sources toward the gc , lazio & cordes  ( 1998b )",
    "concluded that the characteristic separation between  and gc scattering region is 150  pc , that the scattering region is centered on @xmath51 , and that its extent in galactic longitude is between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as a consequence ,  and the heavily broadened oh masers are seen through a hyperstrong scattering region that covers at least a portion of the .",
    "the implied scattering diameter at  0.33  ghz is 12  for a galactic source and at least 600  for an extragalactic source . in this section",
    "we consider three possibilities that would allow  to be both extragalactic and not heavily scattered .",
    "the first possibility is that the hyperstrong scattering region is a relatively homogeneous region of sufficiently limited angular extent that it does not cover .",
    "while the scattering region s extent in galactic latitude is poorly constrained ( @xcite ) , we now show that if the scattering region is homogeneous , it almost certainly extends to at least the galactic latitude of .",

    "the nonthermal thread g0.08@xmath50.15 is 13northeast of , and its width may be affected by scatter broadening ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nonthermal thread g359.79@xmath50.17 is 47 south of  ( figure  [ fig : pband ] ) , and as we now show , its width is also likely to be affected by scatter broadening . from a 1.4  ghz image provided by c.  c.  lang ( 1998 , private communication ) , we have determined that the width of the thread varies from  12to  19 ; an example is shown in figure  [ fig : thread ] . at this frequency",
    "the expected scattering diameter for a galactic source affected by the hyperstrong scattering region is 06 , so we consider these widths to be the intrinsic widths of the thread . as noted above , the expected scattering diameter for a galactic source at  0.33  ghz is 12 . if we assume that the intrinsic width is frequency independent and add the intrinsic width and scattering diameter in quadrature , the expected width of the thread should vary between  17  and  22 .",
    "in fact , the observed width of the thread at  0.33  ghz varies between 23  and  29 .",
    "we regard the agreement between the expected and observed widths of the thread as evidence that scattering affects the thread g359.79@xmath50.17 .",
    "the modest discrepancies between the expected and observed width can be resolved by a combination of a frequency - dependent intrinsic width and a larger separation between the thread and scattering region than assumed . a frequency - dependent intrinsic width would arise if the synchrotron emitting electrons responsible for the thread have a greater transverse extent at low energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the expected scattering diameter depends upon the distance between the source and the scattering region .",
    "we have taken the scattering diameter to be that of , which is appropriate if the thread g359.79@xmath50.17 is also 150  pc behind the scattering region ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the thread is more distant , its expected scattering diameter is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the scattering diameter of , @xmath57 is the -scattering region separation , and @xmath58 is the thread - scattering region separation . if the thread g359.79@xmath50.17 is 100  pc more distant than , scattering alone could explain the discrepancy between the observed and expected widths of the thread .    therefore , if the scattering region is homogeneous and covers the gc uniformly , it extends to a galactic latitude of at least 018 . since  does not display the expected enhanced broadening , we conclude that the scattering region is unlikely to be homogeneous .",
    "the second possibility is that the scattering region is patchy or clumpy and that there are `` holes '' in it .",
    "if so , the size of the clumps would have to be smaller than the 47 separation between  and the thread g359.79@xmath50.17 , equivalent to 12  pc at the .",
    "a scattering region composed of clumps would also explain the contrasts between the diameters of oh  0.190@xmath50.036 and oh  0.319@xmath120.040 and of sgr  a oh1720:b and .",
    "the ( 1.6  ghz ) scattering diameter of oh  0.190@xmath50.036 is only 01 ( @xcite ) , whereas oh  0.319@xmath120.040 has a scattering diameter of  12 ( @xcite ) , even though it is only 9  away and ( angularly ) more distant from .",
    "the case of oh  0.190@xmath50.036 is not as clear - cut as that of , however , because oh  0.190@xmath50.036 could be just behind or in front of the scattering region . while we can not establish definitely that oh  0.190@xmath50.036 is close to the gc , there are two indications that this is likely .",
    "first , in order for it to be unaffected by the scattering region , oh  0.190@xmath50.036 would have to be at least 100  pc closer to the sun than  ( i.e. , no more than 50  pc behind the scattering region ) .",
    "its projected distance from  is 30  pc .",
    "oh / ir stars in the gc have a volume density that varies as @xmath59 and a distribution that is centered on ( lindqvist , habing , & winnberg  1992b ) .",
    "therefore , it is ten times more likely for an oh / ir star to be 30  pc distant from  than it is to be 100  pc distant .",
    "second , oh / ir stars show a @xmath60-@xmath61 diagram indicative of circular rotation about the center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radial velocity of oh  0.190@xmath50.036 ( @xmath62  , @xcite ) is not only consistent with that expected from circular rotation , but is actually larger than the value predicted by lindqvist et al.s  ( 1992b ) model . a radial velocity larger than the model value is exactly what is expected if most of the the source s velocity is projected along the line of sight , i.e. , if oh  0.190@xmath50.036 is at its projected distance from .",
    "sgr  a oh1720:b is a collection of 1720  mhz oh maser features in sgr  a west having anisotropic angular diameters with major axes of approximately 085 .",
    "sgr  a oh1720:c is an unresolved 1720  mhz oh maser located 15  ( @xmath63  pc ) away and associated with sgr  a east ( @xcite ) . in this case , sgr  a west is known to lie in front of sgr  a east ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the scattering region covered the gc uniformly , sgr  a oh1720:c would be expected to show a large scattering disk .",
    "a third possibility for the scattering of  is that the scattering region is far from  ( @xmath64  kpc ) .",
    "we do not consider this option to be viable . in their likelihood analysis of the scattering region toward the gc , lazio & cordes  ( 1998b )",
    "found that , even if they assumed  to be extragalactic , there was still a deficit of sources near , requiring the scattering region to be closer than 500  pc to the .",
    "( their analysis also implicitly assumed a relatively homogeneous scattering region . ) moreover , their likelihood analysis of the oh maser scattering diameters  which was independent of any extragalactic sources  indicated that the -scattering region separation is between  50 and  300  pc . nonetheless , the scattering diameter of  is formidable , 152  at  1  ghz .",
    "this diameter is comparable to that seen for other heavily scattered sources in the galaxy ( e.g. , 1849@xmath5005 , fey , spangler , & cordes  1991 ; ngc6634b , @xcite ) . since the mean free path for intersecting a comparable region of scattering is 8  kpc ( @xcite )",
    ", there is a good chance there could be additional scattering contributed by a region on the far side of the galaxy .",
    "we therefore conclude that the scattering region is inhomogeneous or clumpy on scales of 1020  pc .",
    "prevailing models for the scattering region explain the scattering as arising in the ionized outer layers of molecular clouds , which are produced either from photoionization by the hot stars in the gc ( @xcite ) or as an evaporative interface between the molecular clouds and the ambient x - ray gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "inhomogeneities in the scattering region on scales of  1020  pc are consistent with a molecular cloud origin : molecular clouds in the gc also have scale sizes of  1020  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have examined co ( @xmath65 , @xcite ; @xmath66 , @xcite ) @xmath60-@xmath61 diagrams of the gc in an effort to identify a `` gap '' in the molecular cloud distribution through which could shine .",
    "we focus on co because its emission traces densities @xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "since typical molecular cloud central densities in the gc are @xmath69  @xmath68 , co will trace the outer layers of molecular clouds , the regions that can be ionized easily .",
    "in addition , high resolution , sensitive surveys exist for these transitions , with resolutions comparable to that which we infer for the separation between scattering clumps .",
    "the @xmath65 observations had a 100  beam ( @xmath70  pc at the distance of the gc ) ; the @xmath66 observations had a 9  beam ( @xmath71  pc ) .",
    "the distribution of molecular clouds in the gc displays a well - known asymmetry with a concentration of molecular material toward @xmath72 .",
    "this asymmetry means that a hole in the scattering region for @xmath73 is quite plausible .",
    "indeed , perhaps more difficult to explain is the enhanced angular broadening toward the thread g359.79@xmath50.17 and oh  359.762@xmath50.120 , since there do not appear to be obvious gc molecular clouds in these directions .",
    "the molecular cloud(s ) ( and the associated ionized outer layers ) responsible for the enhanced broadening toward the thread g359.79@xmath50.17 and oh  359.762@xmath50.120 may have velocities near  0  .",
    "most gc molecular clouds can be identified because they have large velocities .",
    "some gc molecular clouds do have velocities near  0  , however , and these clouds can be confused with gas along the line of sight to the .    we distinguish between the _ outer scale _ in the scattering region and the _ separation _ between scattering clumps .",
    "the outer scale , @xmath74 , is simply the largest scale on which the density fluctuations responsible for radio - wave scattering occur . if the density fluctuations arise from a turbulent process , the outer scale reflects the largest scale on which turbulent energy is injected .",
    "if the scattering arises in the ionized , outer layers of molecular clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the outer scale presumably is comparable the thickness of these ionized layers . in both models , the outer scale is small , @xmath75  pc , but it is not necessarily related to the separation between individual clouds .",
    "the small outer scale ( and high temperature @xcite ) of the scattering region ( or cloudlets ) means that it contributes little to the free - free emission and absorption toward the .",
    "rather the bulk of the free - free emission and absorption would be congributed by the extended , low - density region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this extended , low - density region may be ( partially ) responsible for the scattering disks of , b1739@xmath12298 , and b1741@xmath12312 .",
    "the hyperstrong scattering seen toward  and various oh masers is due to this clumpy , gc scattering region .",
    "we have presented new observations of the source  at frequencies between  0.33 and  15  ghz and an absorption spectrum .",
    "we conclude that this source is a fanaroff - riley  ii radio galaxy , based on the following characteristics :    morphology : :    the source is a collinear triple source , with the northeast component    being edge brightened , the central component having a jet - like feature    pointing toward the ne component , and the southwest component being    extended toward the central component .",
    "polarization : :    the edge - brightened component shows a fractional polarization of    approximately 10% .",
    "spectrum : :    steep spectrum , with spectral index @xmath1 ,    characteristic of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "variability : :    no significant structural or flux density variations have been    observed over short ( few weeks to a month ) or long ( 1015  yr ) time    scales .    steep spectrum radio galaxies are typically at @xmath3 .",
    "we have not been able to determine a distance to the source , but the absorption spectrum we have presented suggests a lower limit of  25  kpc , and the classification as an fr  ii radio galaxy suggests a lower limit to the redshift of  0.1 .",
    "though  is only 15  from , it is not affected by the hyperstrong scattering region that is responsible for the large diameter of . if it were ,",
    "would have a diameter in excess of 600  at  0.33  ghz in contrast to the observed diameter of  20 .",
    "we attribute the lack of hyperstrong scattering toward  to an inhomogeneous scattering region .",
    "an inhomogeneous scattering region would also explain the small diameter of the masers oh  0.190@xmath50.036 and sgr  a oh1720:c , both of which appear to be seen through the region of enhanced scattering but have diameters less than 01 at  1.6 and  1.7  ghz , respectively .",
    "the scattering region would have to be inhomogeneous on  510  scales ( 1020  pc at the galactic center ) to explain the small diameters of these two sources .",
    "this scale is comparable to the scale of molecular clouds in the .",
    "prevailing models explain the hyperstrong scattering as due to ionized regions on the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "we regard the close correspondence between the size of molecular clouds and the inhomogeneities in the scattering region as evidence for a connection between the two .",
