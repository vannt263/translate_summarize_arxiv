    "the saffman - taylor instability  @xcite has been the object of extensive study during the last four decades  @xcite .",
    "it arises at the interface separating two viscous fluids constrained to flow in the narrow gap between closed spaced parallel plates , a device known as hele - shaw cell .",
    "the cell thickness is smaller than any other length scale in the problem , so the flow is effectively two - dimensional . the instability arises either from a pressure gradient advancing the less viscous fluid against the more viscous one , or by gravity acting on the density difference between the fluids .",
    "the action of such driving - force mechanisms leads to the celebrated viscous fingering patterns  @xcite .",
    "most saffman - taylor investigations analyze flow between _ flat _ hele - shaw cells . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we started studying the saffman - taylor problem on curved surfaces by considering flow in a _",
    "spherical _ hele - shaw cell ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the interfacial instability was produced by a nonzero flow injection rate @xmath0 , and gravitational effects were completely negleted .",
    "we examined the effect of cell curvature on the shape of the patterns and showed that positive spatial curvature inhibits finger tip - splitting .    in the present paper we focus on the influence of gravity in a spherical hele - shaw cell .",
    "we consider both @xmath1 and @xmath2 at fixed cell curvature .",
    "the unperturbed domain shape is a polar cap of some size , presenting an initially nearly circular boundary , which is gravitationally unstable and evolves at constant area ( @xmath1 ) , or slowly increasing area ( @xmath2 ) , without change of topology .",
    "the study of viscous flow in a nonplanar hele - shaw cell is of interest for both scientific and practical reasons . on the scientific level ,",
    "the influence of spatial curvature on hydrodynamic flow is a matter of fundamental interest .",
    "it also provides a simple mathematical model to describe more general situations involving the filling of a thin cavity between two walls of a given shape with fluid . on the practical level",
    ", it may have applications in a number of industrial , manufacturing processes , ranging through pressure moulding of molten metals and polymer materials  @xcite , and formation of coating defects in drying paint thin films  @xcite .",
    "the gravity - driven instability on a spherical hele - shaw cell also allows one to gain insight into the properties of the dynamically similar , but more complex , rayleigh - taylor instability  @xcite for flow on substrates of arbitrary shapes .",
    "one familiar example of this type of instability is the formation of fingering patterns when chocolate syrup drains , due to the action of gravity , from the top of a scoop of ice cream . despite the apparent simplicity of this example , it is in fact a rather complicated three - dimensional problem  @xcite , much less amenable to analytic treatment than its two - dimensional hele - shaw counterpart .",
    "the geometrically constrained spherical hele - shaw cell forces the flow to become essentially two - dimensional , and the interface one - dimensional .",
    "high viscosity eliminates inertial terms from the equations of motion , making the problem simpler yet .",
    "in contrast , the conventional rayleigh - taylor problem is inertially driven and three - dimensional effects become important  @xcite .    the outline of the work is the following : section  [ derivation ] derives the nonlinear equation of motion including both injection and gravitational driving .",
    "section  [ discussion ] discusses the resulting motion .",
    "section  [ linear ] considers linear stability analysis for purely gravitational driving with @xmath1 .",
    "the growth is purely exponential , and the linear growth rate depends on the geodesic distance from the sphere s north pole .",
    "larger distance causes both faster growth and more unstable modes , though the characteristic wavelength is nearly constant .",
    "the nonvanishing injection case @xmath2 is studied in section  [ inject ] .",
    "injection of a high viscosity fluid tends to stabilize the interface . for @xmath2 linear growth",
    "is non - exponential due to evolution of the linear growth rate with distance .",
    "section  [ nonlinear ] studies the coupling of a small number of modes .",
    "it is shown that for gravity - driven flow fingers have tendency to finger tip - sharpening .",
    "consider two immiscible , incompressible , viscous fluids , flowing in a spherical hele - shaw cell of thickness @xmath3 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the effetively two - dimensional flow takes place on the surface of a sphere endowed with the metric  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radius of curvature of the sphere , @xmath6 denotes the azimuthal angle measured on the sphere and @xmath7 is the geodesic distance from the sphere s north pole . the polar angle @xmath8 .",

    "fluid 1 is injected into fluid 2 through an inlet located at the sphere s north pole , at a given flow rate @xmath0 , which is the area covered per unit time .",
    "fluid 2 is simultaneously withdrawn , at the same rate , through an outlet placed at the south pole .",
    "the acceleration of gravity is constant , represented by * g * , and points from north to south pole .    during the flow",
    ", the fluid - fluid interface has a perturbed shape described as @xmath17 .",

    ", we consider flow in a closed cell obeying mass conservation . to drive the interface gravitationally , one could first allow the system to form a stable , unperturbed spherical cap at the south pole , and then invert the spherical cell to put the denser fluid on top in the unstable position at the north pole .",
    "we begin by investigating the dispersion relation  ( [ growth ] ) .",
    "notice that the gravity term in eq .",
    "( [ growth ] ) contains no explicit dependence on radial distance .",
    "this finding is somewhat surprising , since the gravity term in darcy s law  ( [ darcy ] ) clearly presents a dependence on @xmath42 .",
    "physical intuition suggests a factor of @xmath62 should multiply the gravity term in  ( [ growth ] ) , making it vanish at the poles and become maximal at the equator .",
    "this apparent missing factor reappears if we rewrite the linear growth rate in terms of the wave number @xmath63 .",

    ", @xmath64 determines the characteristic wavelength of a perturbation .    to better understand the physical information behind the description of the linear stage in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath64 , we plot the linear growth rate at a sequence of radial distances @xmath65 in figures 2a and 2b .",
    "we use typical experimental parameters given in a recent experimental work in rotating , flat hele - shaw cells  @xcite : fluid 1 is a silicone oil ( @xmath66 @xmath67/@xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath67/@xmath71 ) and fluid 2 is air ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) . the thickness of the cell @xmath74 @xmath68 and the surface tension @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "we set the radius of the sphere @xmath77 @xmath68 and acceleration of gravity @xmath78 @xmath68/@xmath79 .    comparing figures 2a and 2b ,",
    "it is clear that the fastest growing mode ( number of fingers @xmath29 developing at a maximum growth rate ) moves to large @xmath29 for large radial distance ( and small @xmath29 for small radial distance ) in order to keep the corresponding fastest growing @xmath64 , and thus the apparent wavelength , nearly constant .",
    "the same effect occurs in radial flow in flat space  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the shift to larger @xmath29 , the growth rate of the fastest growing mode increases with radial distance because the net gravitational force depends on @xmath19 .",
    "this differs from the case of radial flow in flat space  @xcite , where the interface velocity falls off as @xmath80 causing the growth rate of the fastest growing mode to decrease .",
    "consider the purely linear contribution , which appears as the first term on the right hand side of equation  ( [ result ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath1 simplifies the theoretical description : @xmath81 constant , and consequently the linear growth rate @xmath82 is _ time independent_. this implies that the actual relaxation or growth of mode @xmath29 is purely exponential @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the initial perturbation amplitude . to see the overall effect of eq .",
    "( [ relax ] ) , we plot evolved interfaces using the same experimental parameters as those used in figures 2a and 2b .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the net perturbation  ( [ z ] ) in terms of cosine and sine modes @xmath85 $ ] , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are real - valued .",
    "we take into account modes @xmath29 ranging from @xmath88 up to @xmath89 .",
    "figure 3 depicts the evolution of the interfaces , for a random choice of phases , at time @xmath90 @xmath69 .",
    "we evolve from two distinct initial radii ( a ) @xmath91 , and ( b ) @xmath92 . in both cases",
    "@xmath93 @xmath68 and we use the same randomly chosen phases . it is evident that for larger radial distances ( or equivalently , larger polar angles ) we have both faster growth and more unstable modes , though the characteristic wavelength is not very different , in agreement with the predictions made from figures 2a and 2b .",
    "now consider the nonvanishing injection case .",
    "taking @xmath2 introduces two important new effects .",
    "first , inspecting equation  ( [ growth ] ) , we see that @xmath0 multiplies a term linear in @xmath29 that must be added to the growth rate @xmath94 obtained with @xmath1 . if the inner fluid is high viscosity , so that @xmath95 , then this new term in @xmath94 is negative .",
    "all modes grow more slowly with @xmath2 , and some may even become stable .",
    "thus , @xmath2 diminishes the strength of the instability .",
    "essentially , the flow fills in the gaps between the fingers .",
    "the second effect is more subtle .",
    "since the unperturbed interface radius @xmath96 is now _ time dependent _ , the linear growth rate @xmath94 evolves with time as the radial distance steadily grows . at any instant",
    "the interface evolves exponentially with an instantaneous growth rate @xmath94 depending on the current @xmath96 . for sufficiently small @xmath0",
    "the instantaneous @xmath94 at @xmath96 nearly equals the @xmath1 value for the same @xmath96 .",
    "we call this a _ quasistatic _ approximation , and within this approximation it is clear that an increasing number of modes become unstable as time progresses due to the steady increase of @xmath96",
    ". the evolution of @xmath94 in the quasistatic approximation is given by the series of curves shown in figure 2 .",
    "if we wish to study the linear growth _ without _ making the quasistatic approximation , we may integrate the equation of motion  ( [ result ] ) exactly , keeping only terms of first order in @xmath33 on the right - hand side . because @xmath94 is time dependent , through the variation of @xmath96 ,",
    "the exact solution of the linear equation of motion becomes non - exponential and can be written as @xmath97^{a|n| } \\exp \\left \\ {   \\frac{2 \\pi |n|}{q } \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha ( n^{2 } - 1)}{a } \\left ( \\frac{c}{s } - \\frac{c_{0}}{s_{0 } } \\right ) + \\gamma a \\left ( c_{0 } -   c \\right ) \\right ] \\right \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 , and @xmath19 , @xmath99 and @xmath62 all depend on time .",
    "we use the mode coupling equation  ( [ result ] ) to investigate the effect of the nonlinear terms in the interface evolution .",
    "we are interested in studying how gravity influences the shape of the fingering structures , focusing on finger - tip behavior .",
    "finger tip - splitting and tip - sharpening phenomena are related to the influence of a fundamental mode @xmath29 on the growth of its harmonic @xmath100 . without loss of generality",
    "we may choose the phase of the fundamental mode so that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we replace the time derivative terms @xmath103 and @xmath104 by @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , for consistent second order expressions . under these circumstances",
    "the equation of motion for the harmonic cosine mode becomes @xmath107 where the finger - tip function is @xmath108 + \\frac{3 \\alpha c ~(2n^{2 } - 1)}{2a^{3}s^{3 } } \\right \\}.\\ ] ] the corresponding equation for the sine modes @xmath109 is not as interesting as  ( [ new3 ] ) , since growth of @xmath109 is uninfluenced by @xmath110 .",
    "the sign of @xmath111 dictates whether finger tip - splitting or finger tip - sharpening is favored by the dynamics  @xcite . if @xmath112 , at second order the result is a driving term of order @xmath113 forcing growth of @xmath114 . with this particular phase of the harmonic forced by the dynamics , the @xmath29 outwards - pointing fingers of the fundamental mode @xmath29 tend to split .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath115 growth of @xmath116 would be favored , leading to outwards - pointing finger tip - sharpening .",
    "a noteworthy point about equation  ( [ t(2n , n ) ] ) is that it shows no dependence whatsoever on gravity . in the evaluation of @xmath111 from equation  ( [ result ] ) we found that the term involving gravity in @xmath117 exactly cancels against the term involving gravity in @xmath118 . the second order term driving tip - splitting in equation  ( [ new3 ] ) is therefore independent of the force of gravity , though gravity does generally influence mode coupling at second and higher orders .",
