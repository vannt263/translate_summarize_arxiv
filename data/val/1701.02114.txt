    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) has been tested successfully in a large number of experiments .",
    "the higgs boson introduced through a single su(2 ) doublet @xcite has been observed at lhc @xcite with a mass near 125 gev .",
    "the ongoing analyses at lhc confirm that the observed boson has the same properties expected for a standard model higgs .",
    "however , it is still an open question whether the observed particle belongs to a single su(2 ) doublet or a richer framework such as a two higgs doublet model @xcite .",
    "the two higgs doublet models are well motivated beyond sm from different aspects .",
    "they provide the basis for building weakly coupled theories such as the minimal supersymmetric extention of standard model ( mssm ) @xcite as well as the strongly coupled composite higgs model @xcite .",
    "there are four types of 2hdms which are designed to accomodate different possible scenarios of higgs - fermion couplings .",

    "contrary to the mssm which involves almost degenerate heavy higgs boson states , the 2hdm allows for different higgs boson masses , thus providing a broader parameter space available for study .",
    "the theory and phenomenology of 2hdms has been discussed in detail in @xcite . in addition",
    "to direct searches , the 2hdm is also a key tool in flavor physics for bringing theory predictions close to experimental observations by including processes which involve 2hdm higgs bosons @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "different benchmark points are defined in the higgs boson mass spectrum space and a search is performed at a linear collider .",
    "the signal process is taken as a joint @xmath10 production through @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "it is expected that a leptonic decay of the neutral higgs ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) would provide a clear signal due to the reasonable lepton reconstruction efficiency at linear colliders .",
    "for such a process , the 2hdm type iv is chosen to enhance the leptonic higgs decay at high @xmath15 .",
    "there has been a recent work searching for the same signal at lhc @xcite . in this analysis",
