    "in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar systems the gravitational interaction is modified for curing the newtonian divergence at short distances .",
    "basically , such modifications are introduced through a soft cut - off : the softening length @xmath1 .",
    "however , the precise form in which they are implemented can vary . since gravity plays a fundamental role in these systems and the gravitational interaction",
    "is modified precisely where it becomes singular , the dynamical effects of softening should be well understood when designing experiments and interpreting their results .",
    "this dynamical problem has recently stimulated considerable interest ( e.g. , hernquist & barnes 1990 ; hernquist & ostriker 1992 ; kandrup et al .",
    "1992 ; pfenniger 1993 ; pfenniger & friedli 1993 ; gurzadyan & pfenniger 1994 ; romeo 1994 , hereafter paper i ; byrd 1995 ; gerber 1996 ; merritt 1996 ; weinberg 1996 ; sommer - larsen et al .  1997",
    "; theis 1997 ; see also goodman et al .",
    "1993 ; farouki & salpeter 1994 ) . for extensive overviews",
    "see the above - mentioned pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) , gurzadyan & pfenniger ( 1994 ) and paper i.    in paper i we have investigated the stability problem in the case of 2-d models with plummer softening , which are commonly employed in simulations of disc galaxies .",
    "the basic message is that the effect of softening becomes strongly artificial for @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the typical radial wavelength , which means half an order of magnitude below the expected value .",
    "the major results are summarized in the form of a criterion of approximate physical consistency for @xmath1 and a stability criterion for the toomre parameter .",
    "( other important aspects of the stability problem have been considered by byrd 1995 . )    in the present paper we carry out five extensions , as is discussed below .    1 .",
    "we generalize the stability analysis of paper i to an _ arbitrary _ isotropic form of softening .",
    "this is a natural extension since types of softened gravity different from the standard plummer softening are becoming more and more commonly employed ( e.g. , combes et al .",
    "1990 ; palou et al .",
    "1993 ; shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) . in particular , the alternatives proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) and pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) reflect an interesting idea , viz .",
    "that softening should be as localized as possible since there is no clear reason for modifying the gravitational interaction at long distances , and it is tempting to explore its dynamical consequences . from a more general point of view , this and the following extensions provide the tools for comparing experiments that employ different types of softened gravity .",
    "we investigate the implications of our stability analysis for the classical relaxation problem ( rybicki 1972 ; white 1988 ) .",
    "relaxation and stability are intimately related in self - gravitating systems , and even simple treatments reveal their strong coupling through random motions . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of velocity dispersion to the relaxation time has been understood only in part and , because of that , the classical argument favouring the choice of large values of @xmath1 is wrong .",
    "we revise this argument and conclude that neither small nor large values of @xmath1 are convenient .",
    "surprisingly , there exists an intermediate choice of @xmath1 that _ optimizes _ the ` dynamical resolution ' of the model , i.e.  its faithfulness in simulating the dynamics of 3-d discs with newtonian gravity , especially in situations near to the stability threshold .",
    "we identify the optimal characteristics , and show how to evaluate them for a given type of softened gravity .",
    "in addition to investigating this aspect of the relaxation problem , we explain how effectively softening reduces noise on various scales .",
    "3 .   we complete the examination of 2-d models with isotropic softening by investigating the equilibrium problem for an axisymmetric state with epicyclic motions .",
    "in particular , we explain how significantly the circular speed and related quantities deviate from their newtonian behaviours at various distances from the centre .",
    "we consider 3-d models with isotropic softening and examine two limiting cases : discs and the simple , yet instructive , jeans problem .",
    "an extension to 3d has been encouraged by friedli ( 1994 ) and junqueira & combes ( 1996 , see the interesting remarks in sect .",
    "real stellar systems have several gravitationally interacting components . both @xmath0-body simulations and theoretical works",
    "are forced to use simplified models , which do not necessarily provide faithful representations of the complexity of such systems .",
    "our motivation is to understand the basic differences between the dynamical effects of softening in 3d and 2d , in the presence of a single stellar component ( 3-d vs.  2-d discs and jeans problem vs.  discs ) . in particular , we point up the _ strong _ modifications introduced by a homogeneous geometry and the absence of rotation . 5 .",
    "we complete the examination of 3-d models by discussing the basic dynamical effects of softening anisotropy .",
    "the idea underlying this extension is that softening should be anisotropic in simulations of stellar systems where significantly higher spatial resolution is required along a certain direction , such as in disc galaxies .",
    "the alternative family of softening recently proposed by pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) reflects such an important idea , and it is tempting to explore the dynamical relations between its members .",
    "( an analogous idea has been discussed in the context of smoothed particle hydrodynamics by shapiro et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 and fulbright et al .  1995 ; hernquist , private communication , has remarked that in models with anisotropic smoothing there may be a significant tendency for angular momentum not to be conserved . )",
    "these extensions all together form a method for exploring the dynamical effects of softening in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar systems .",
    "our method is described in sect .  2 , and is structured as in the previous discussion .",
    "the two applications mentioned in the same context are shown in sect .  3",
    "( see also appendix a ) .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are drawn in sect .",
    "4 , where we present our contribution in a more general perspective and motivate future applications .",
    "in 2-d discs with isotropic softened gravity , a given surface - density perturbation @xmath4 induces a potential perturbation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the point - mass potential , which depends on the softening length @xmath1 [ @xmath7 is also known as the softening kernel ] . in analysing the poisson equation ( 1 )",
    ", we adopt the lowest - order wkbj approach , as in paper i , but with a different albeit asymptotically equivalent spectral representation . in simple terms , the new feature consists in considering perturbations with a radial dependence @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radial wavenumber and @xmath11 denotes the bessel function of the first kind and order @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , abramowitz & stegun 1972 ) .",

    "correspondingly , the contribution of self - gravity to the dispersion relation is weakened through a reduction of the active unperturbed surface density by the same factor .",
    "thus , @xmath18 provides complete information about the effect of isotropic softening on the stability of 2-d discs , and its evaluation is the starting - point of our method .",
    "there are two complementary routes to @xmath18 .",
    "one is to calculate it analytically from : @xmath19(k)\\ ] ] ( use , e.g. , the comprehensive table of integrals by gradshteyn & ryzhik 1994 ) .",
    "this equation follows directly from eq .",

    "this equation is more convenient than the original eq .",
    "( 5 ) because the slow decay of the oscillatory integrand as @xmath24 is speeded up .",
    "such an improvement is obtained with simple tricks , viz .",
    "integrating by parts and singling out the newtonian behaviour of @xmath25 at long distances .",
    "[ [ the - effective - scale - height . ] ] the effective scale height .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    once @xmath26 has been evaluated , the second step is to analyse its behaviour at small @xmath27 since stability is basically a large - scale property . in order to understand the general features of this behaviour",
    ", we can equivalently start from eq .",
    "( 5 ) or ( 6 ) and use techniques of asymptotic expansion of integrals ( see , e.g. , bender & orszag 1978 ) . in eq .  ( 5 ) , we should first single out the newtonian @xmath28-dependence of @xmath7 at long distances , and then expand @xmath29 . in eq .  ( 6 ) , we can directly expand @xmath30 .",

    "in fact , a comparison with the reduction factor of 3-d discs with newtonian gravity ( shu 1968 ; vandervoort 1970 ; romeo 1992 ) shows that softening mimics thickness on large scales and @xmath33 has the effect of a scale height , as far as density waves are concerned ( for bending waves see masset & tagger 1996 ) . as an alternative to eq .  ( 7 ) , @xmath33 can be evaluated from the conversion factor @xmath34    [ [ characteristics . ] ] characteristics .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the third and last step is to extract detailed information concerning the stability properties .",
    "this part of the method has been described in paper i and can be generalized without special difficulties .",
    "so in the following discussion we briefly introduce the basic concepts and point out the major results of the stability analysis .",
    "we adopt the basic fluid description with the following scaling and parametrization : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath3 is the radial wavelength of the perturbation , @xmath39 is the toomre wavelength , @xmath40 is the unperturbed surface density , @xmath41 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath42 is the planar sound speed .",
    "the stability properties are described by the marginal stability curve , i.e.  the dispersion relation for marginally stable perturbations viewed as a curve in the @xmath43 plane for a given @xmath44 : @xmath45=0\\ , .\\ ] ] in particular , the stability level is measured by the effective parameter @xmath46 where the threshold @xmath47 corresponds to the square root of the global maximum of the marginal curve , and the typical radial wavelength corresponds to the location @xmath48 of this maximum .",
    "the values of @xmath44 and the related quantities that characterize the stability properties are presented below .    *",
    "the conversion factor @xmath49 , now expressed in dimensionless form , has already been discussed ( cf .  the effective scale height ) . *",
    "the safety threshold for approximate physical consistency is @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath52 , softening mimics the effect of thickness .",
    "in particular , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , softening causes artificial stabilization and a moderate degree of ` blueshift ' . * the critical value @xmath56 is such that @xmath57 . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the fundamental meaning of velocity dispersion becomes _ obscure _ because the stability level is no longer actively controlled by @xmath59 .",
    "this fact has serious dynamical implications : it artificially precludes the possibility of simulating regimes of normal spiral structure , which require fine - tuned choices of the stability level . *",
    "the critical radial wavelength is @xmath60 .",
    "its deviation from @xmath61 indicates the sensitivity of @xmath48 for @xmath62 .",
    "let us investigate the implications of our stability analysis for the classical relaxation problem ( rybicki 1972 ; white 1988 ; see also hockney & eastwood 1988 ) .",
    "we first sketch the basic ideas .",
    "the rybicki - white relaxation time @xmath63 is proportional to the softening length @xmath1 , the cube of velocity dispersion @xmath64 and the number of computer particles @xmath0 . in turn , @xmath64 is proportional to the safronov - toomre parameter @xmath65 .",
    "so it seems that large values of @xmath1 are convenient , since they result in a long @xmath63 for given @xmath65 and @xmath0 .",
    "the idea underlying this argument is that a given @xmath65 corresponds to a constant stability level as @xmath1 varies .",
    "but it is not so .",
    "in fact , the stability threshold @xmath66 depends on @xmath1 and the level is measured by the effective parameter @xmath67 .",
    "thus large values of @xmath1 are not convenient at all , because they correspond to a low @xmath66 and result in a short @xmath63 for given @xmath59 and @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath63 is short for both small and large values of @xmath1 , there must exist an intermediate choice of @xmath1 that maximizes @xmath68 .",
    "does it satisfy the criterion of approximate physical consistency ?",
    "the answer is : yes , it does .",

    "in particular , cs has a rather soft cut - off at @xmath156 , @xmath1 being the nominal softening length , whereas hs has a sharper cut - off at @xmath157 .",
    "the results of the dynamical comparison are presented in fig",
    ".  3 ( left ) and table 1 ( top ) , which are discussed below , and in figs .  4 ( left ) and 5 .",
    "useful analytical formulae are reported in appendix a.    figure 3 ( left ) shows that the effective scale height @xmath33 varies significantly with softening type , but apart from that the stability properties are analogous on scales larger than @xmath158 .",
    "this can be shown by rescaling @xmath10 in terms of @xmath159 and noting that @xmath18 is similar in the three types for @xmath160 . for @xmath161 , @xmath162 changes sign and starts to oscillate , in contrast to @xmath163 .",
    "an analogous behaviour occurs in @xmath164 , but is less noticeable .",
    "negative values of @xmath18 mean that a given surface - density perturbation is in phase with the induced potential perturbation and , correspondingly , that the contribution of self - gravity to the dispersion relation is stabilizing .",
    "however , this feature does not affect the stability properties on scales comparable to the inverse of the typical radial wavenumber , since @xmath18 changes sign well beyond the critical point @xmath165 [ cf .",
    "table 1 ( top ) ] .",
    "the related oscillations of @xmath18 mean that in certain ranges of @xmath27 noise is suppressed more effectively on larger than smaller scales , and correspond to oscillations of the short - wave branch of the dispersion relation .",
    "on the other hand , this feature has not significant consequences for the relaxation properties , because the corrected optimal relaxation level @xmath166 is approximately the same as in p [ cf .",
    "table 1 ( top ) ] .",
    "table 1 ( top ) shows that the stability and relaxation characteristics vary significantly with softening type .",
    "the largest variations occur between hs and p , concern @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and are up to a factor of 3 .",
    "in contrast , the corrected optimal relaxation level @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 remain approximately constant .",
    "the variations between hs and cs are within 20% .      as a second application of our method",
    ", we consider an anisotropic generalization of hs , the family of homogeneous - ellipsoid softening ( pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) , and compare the dynamical effects of two representative spheroidal members : one oblate with @xmath172 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 being the planar and vertical softening semi - axes , and the other prolate with @xmath173 ; hereafter abbreviated to hos and hps , respectively . regarding @xmath125 as the softening length of reference",
    ", @xmath174 gives a measure of softening anisotropy .",
    "the behaviours of these types of softened gravity are shown in fig .  2 ( right ) .",
    "anisotropy is implemented in a form consistent with the finite - sized particle interpretation of softening , i.e.  through a spheroidal deformation of the field particle .",
    "this mainly corresponds to a spheroidal transformation of the surface on which the force peaks , but it also strongly influences the behaviour in the plane .",
    "in particular , the degree of softening localization , the sharpness and magnitude of the force peak differ from those in hs [ cf.fig .  2 ( left ) ] , and are higher in hos than hps .",
    "so a 2-d analysis is required even though the isotropic case has already been investigated .",
    "the results of the dynamical comparison are presented in fig .  3 ( right ) and table 1 ( bottom ) , which are discussed below , and in fig .  4 ( right ) .",
    "the major points are then generalized in the final discussion .",
    "useful analytical formulae are reported in appendix a.    figure 3 ( right ) shows that , for @xmath175 , @xmath176 is concave , in contrast to @xmath177 .",
    "the transition behaviour occurs in @xmath178 [ cf .",
    "fig .  3 ( left ) ] .",
    "concavity of @xmath18 mainly means that softening has a stronger tendency to cause artificial stabilization for a given effective scale height @xmath33 , for we know that the reduction factor of 3-d discs with newtonian gravity is convex ( cf.paper i , fig .  1 ) .",
    "in fact , hos does not mimic the effect of thickness for realistically large values of @xmath33 , since the safety threshold for approximate physical consistency @xmath179 and the optimal value @xmath180 are ill - defined [ cf .",
    "table 1 ( bottom ) ] .",
    "concavity of @xmath18 also means that softening causes a moderate degree of ` redshift ' . for @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath177",
    "become analogous to @xmath183 , and analogous conclusions can be drawn concerning the stability and relaxation properties .",
    "table 1 ( bottom ) shows that the stability and relaxation characteristics differ considerably in the two types .",
    "the major qualitative differences concern @xmath168 and @xmath170 , and have been pointed out above [ cf .",
    "discussion of fig .  3 ( right ) ] .",
    "excluding @xmath167 , which has a restricted range of applicability in hos , the largest variation concerns @xmath80 and is beyond half an order of magnitude .",
    "in contrast , note the low sensitivity of the corrected optimal relaxation level @xmath184 , which remains roughly constant .",
    "finally , instead of comparing those results with the isotropic case , let us clarify the dynamical relations between _ all _ the spheroidal members of the family of homogeneous - ellipsoid softening and the standard type of softened gravity [ cf .",
    "table 1 ( top ) ] .    1 .",
    "a general feature of the spheroidal members is that @xmath33 is determined by @xmath126 alone : @xmath185 .",
    "this is not intuitive since a more natural softening length in the plane is expected to be @xmath125 .",
    "2 .   all the oblate members with @xmath186 have an ill - defined @xmath179 , i.e.  @xmath187 , and thus differ fundamentally from p ( cf .",
    "3 .   as @xmath174 increases ,",
    "such a difference becomes progressively less important ( cf .",
    "hs and hps ) .",
    "indeed , the prolate member with @xmath188 , i.e.  @xmath189 , turns out to be hardly distinguishable from p. ( values of @xmath190 are not employed in simulations . )",
    "modelling gravity is a fundamental problem that must be tackled in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar systems , and satisfactory solutions require a deep understanding of the dynamical effects of softening .",
    "this problem has deserved special attention both in the past ( e.g. , miller 1970 , 1976 ) and in more recent times ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .  1985 ; hernquist & katz 1989 ; pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) .",
    "viewed in this general perspective , our contribution has a threefold practical importance in addition to the points emphasized in sect .  1 .    1 .   the two present applications of our method reveal the dynamical differences between the most representative types of softened gravity : the isotropic p , cs and hs ( abbreviated as in sect .",
    "3.1 ) , and the anisotropic hos and hps ( abbreviated as in sect .",
    "the major conclusions concerning their dynamical resolution , i.e.  their faithfulness in simulating the newtonian dynamics , are summarized below . 1 .",
    "as regards the isotropic types , the dynamical resolution is comparable .",
    "this results from the fact that , even though the spatial resolution and the effectiveness in reducing noise differ significantly in p , cs and hs for the same nominal softening length @xmath1 , those differences can largely be removed by considering a more appropriate softening length of reference .",
    "as regards the anisotropic types , the dynamical resolution is significantly coupled parallel and perpendicular to the plane . in the plane , it decreases in quality from hps to hos , and the transition occurs in the oblate members for a softening axial ratio @xmath191 ( hps is dynamically similar to p ) .",
    "these disadvantages result from the finite - sized particle implementation of softening anisotropy . on the other hand",
    ", they have less importance than the advantage of introducing such a degree of freedom into 3-d simulations of disc galaxies , which has been emphasized by pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) and in our method .",
    "3 .   last but not least , when employing these types of softened gravity in simulations of disc galaxies , we should recall that the dynamical resolution depends _ critically _ on two quantities : @xmath1 , or @xmath125 for a given @xmath174 , and the safronov - toomre parameter @xmath65 ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath1 or @xmath125 should be checked vs.  the profiles of the characteristic values @xmath192 , @xmath179 and @xmath193 , which are tabulated in the applications . the choice of @xmath65 should be checked vs.  the profiles of the stability threshold @xmath66 and level @xmath194 , which can be evaluated as is explained in the method .",
    "our method can be applied for testing new ideas about softening .",
    "there are two features that encourage such future applications",
    "one is the _ unified _ approach adopted for investigating stability , relaxation and equilibrium . as a result , full information about the dynamical effects of softening is contained in a single quantity : the reduction factor @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   the other is the _ modular _ structure of the method .",
    "we describe step by step how to extract detailed information concerning the dynamical properties , starting from @xmath18 and pointing out the quantities of major interest .",
    "3 .   but our method can be applied in another , more fruitful , way : for developing new ideas about softening . indeed , it opens a _ direct _ route to the discovery of optimal types of softened gravity for given dynamical requirements , and thus to the accomplishment of a physically consistent modelling even in the presence of a cold interstellar gaseous component",
    ". such a future application will be the objective of a ` twin ' paper .",
    "this paper is dedicated to my parents francesco and grazia .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank the referee , daniel pfenniger , whose papers about softening have represented an invaluable source of inspiration for both developing and maturing my ideas . in addition , i am very grateful to francoise combes and lars hernquist for strong encouragement and valuable suggestions on a previous draft of this paper .",
    "i am also very grateful to john black , daniel friedli , cathy horellou , henry kandrup , richard miller , juan muzzio , masafumi noguchi and jan palou for strong encouragement and useful discussions . the financial support of the swedish natural science research council is greatly appreciated .",
