    "in this paper we report results for the critical temperature , susceptibility , magnetization and specific heat for quantum heisenberg spins ( @xmath1 to @xmath3 ) on the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice using the cluster variation approximation ( cva ) .",
    "this pyrochlore lattice is a lattice with corner sharing tetrahedra ( cst ) which has the highest known degree of frustration according to lacorre s definition  @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "the properties of spins on this pyrochlore lattice ( see figure  [ figure :- pyrochlore - structure ] ) have received much attention because it promises to be a realization of a 3d quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) with possibly exotic ground states . investigated quantum ground states are for example based on singlet valence bonds , leading to a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) system , introduced by anderson  @xcite for a 2d triangular lattice , or a valence bond solid / crystal , or order based on a singlet tetrahedron ( = rvt ) or plaquette state , or the formation of a ground state with long range chiral order .",
    "one of the basic features of such frustrated spin lattices is their extensive residual or zero  point entropy at @xmath4 , or formulated in another way - a macroscopic degenerate ground state , with a degeneracy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is of the order of avogadro s number .",
    "the consequences of this degeneracy are many : 1 ) a large decrease of the ordering temperature @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the asymptotic curie ",
    "weiss temperature  @xcite ; in the region below the classical mean  field transition temperature the spins enter in a highly correlated quantum state , which in the case of classical spins is called a `` cooperative paramagnet ''  @xcite , and a possible spin freezing below @xmath11 into a spin glass phase  @xcite ; 2 ) a shift of spectral weight to low energies from high energies of the order of @xmath10 @xcite ; 3 ) schottky  type anomalies in the specific heat in case there are no states in the singlet  triplet gap and a specific heat @xmath12 with singlet states in the singlet  triplet gap , while the susceptibility is always thermally activated ; 4 ) small external perturbations can lift ( part ) of the ground state degeneracy and thereby may radically change the type of ( exotic ) ground state : for example lattice distortions related to a jahn  teller effect @xcite bond disorder @xcite , field induced order @xcite or the formation of a spin glass phase ; 5 ) order - by - disorder : such small perturbations can also be quantum and/or thermal fluctuations ( entropic ground states selection ) @xcite ; 6 ) anomalous , non - universal , critical properties @xcite ; 7 ) peculiar spin dynamics @xcite ; 8) in case of ising spins quantized along the local @xmath13 axis a cubic spin  ice type ground state  @xcite , which , in case that the dipole ",
    "dipole interactions are stronger than the exchange interactions , is described as dipolar  spin  ice  @xcite    reviews of experimental work on the susceptibility of rare ",
    "earth stannate pyrochlores can be found in @xcite , for the magnetic properties of compounds with a pyrochlore spin lattice in  @xcite , and for the bulk magnetization of rare  earth titanate pyrochlores in  @xcite .",
    "reviews of theoretical work are given by bramwell and gingras @xcite , moessner  @xcite , and a review by lhuillier and misguich  @xcite where the pyrochlore system is discussed in the perspective of the general class of frustrated quantum spin systems .",
    "anderson  @xcite started the study of order on the pyrochlore lattice and compared it with the positional disorder of h in hexagonal ice .",
    "he predicted the absence of ising - type order down to @xmath4 in case of antiferromagnetic nearest  neighbour interactions for spins quantized along a tetragonal axis , calling such a system `` cubic  ice ''  @xcite .",
    "we can sum up the present understanding of the classical antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin @xmath1 on the pyrochlore lattice as follows : this spin system does not order from the point of view of classical spins : the highest @xmath14 modes are two  fold degenerate without any dispersion  @xcite , meaning that below the mean - field ordering temperature @xmath15 the spin system moves in these modes , thereby using only 1/2 of the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "moessner and chalker  @xcite showed by an explicit construction procedure that all ground state configurations are connected , without any energy barrier .",
    "however certain correlations remain , which give rise to certain features in the neutron scattering : a few long - range correlations in high  symmetry directions is build into the ground state .",
    "various authors have studied possible `` order  by  disorder '' in this lattice , introducing thermal or quantum fluctuations on top of the classical ground state , see for example  @xcite .",
    "most authors , probably starting with reimers  @xcite , first diagonalize the heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin hamiltonian with nearest  neighbour exchange on an isolated tetrahedron and then construct the pyrochlore lattice with these non - overlapping tetrahedra , and introduce the interaction between these tetrahedra as a perturbation : @xmath16 .",
    "the tetrahedron ",
    "tetrahedron interaction has been calculated up to 3rd order in @xmath17 .",
    "adeva and huber  @xcite used the most simple approach by neglecting these tetrahedron  tetrahedron interactions : in this way long  range order is excluded from the outset .",
    "the asymptotic `` curie  weiss '' temperature found is 1/2 of the value obtained from the canonical mean field approximation .",
    "canals and lacroix @xcite performed a density matrix expansion up to @xmath18 and found that at this order the degeneracy is weakly lifted ( @xmath19 ) giving rise to a collinear af spin structure : the spins along @xmath20 are parallel while nearest ",
    "neighbour perpendicular @xmath20 crossings are antiparallel .",
    "the correlation length is at most of the order of one lattice spacing .",
    "their approach can not elucidate the character of the ground state : whether it has long range order in one of the exotic ground states mentioned above .",
    "several authors have discussed this possibility by calculating the tetrahedron ",
    "tetrahedron interactions in the restricted space of the two  fold degenerate singlet states and 3fold degenerate triplet states of the tetrahedron .",
    "the latter are essential for inter ",
    "tetrahedron interactions .",
    "although starting from different points of view , the ground state of this spin system seems to be some singlet ",
    "dimer covering of the pyrochlore lattice : tsunetsugu  @xcite used a chiral ansatz and found vanishing chirality : the ground state is a four sublattice system of tetrahedra with singlet dimer order on three sublattices each occupied by one of the possible tetrahedron singlet dimer states , and the 4th sublattice is locally disordered.the ground state of the singlet dimer lattice can be characterized as a valence bond solid .",
    "singlet excitations will appear in the singlet  triplet gap : these are oscillations in the dimer pattern .",
    "a similar ground state has been found by eljahal _ et al _",
    "@xcite , by isoda and mori  @xcite .",
    "a dimer covering was already discussed by harris _",
    "recently berg _ et al _",
    "@xcite pushed this approach one step further and used the two  fold degenerate singlet ground state of a super tetrahedron - consisting of 4 tetrahedra connected each by different bonds - as a basis for a perturbation calculation .",
    "to each super tetrahedron is assigned a pseudo spin , these super tetrahedra form a bcc lattice . from a monte",
    " carlo study , treating these pseudo spins as classical entities .",
    "they find that the ground state is ordered anti ferromagnetically , with ferromagnetic layers .",
    "adeva - garcia and huber@xcite have studied the magnetic properties of spins on the pyrochlore lattice using the constant  coupling approximation and recently applied it to zncr@xmath21o@xmath22@xcite .",
    "the same authors studied the critical properties of these pyrochlore spin systems using a renormalization group appraoch@xcite .",
    "when one looks into the pyrochlore structure one finds that each atom on this lattice shares six planar hexagons , two in each @xmath13 direction , of which each of the three pairs of hexagons are edge sharing .",
    "the hexagons in a @xmath23 plane form a kagom lattice .",
    "so this pyrochlore lattice also may be characterized as a lattice of inter - penetrating kagom lattices .",
    "let us now turn our attention to _ nn _ ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "there is at first sight no reason why the spins on a lattice of cst would not order at finite temperature .",
    "first consider the case that the spins are ising spins pointing along the local @xmath13 . in that case",
    "there are six degenerate states with a two - spin - in two - spin - out configuration on each tetrahedron  @xcite and the spin states can be mapped on a model describing the two possible positions of hydrogen in the ice structure @xcite .",
    "this leads to so ",
    "called ice rules for the possible low temperature spin configurations .",
    "a clear exposition of these rules and its consequences can be found in @xcite . because of this ground state degeneracy , the entropy at @xmath4 k is finite , and the macroscopic ground state of this spin system is called spin  ice .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the cluster variation approximation ( cva ) for the configurational entropy , in which one divides the lattice in a set of overlapping clusters@xcite ( basis cluster ) to study the magnetic properties of quantum heisenberg spins on a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "we use the tetrahedron as basis cluster .",
    "we include tetrahedral anisotropy , and an anisotropy in the exchange interactions caused by a tetragonal distortion of the lattice .",
    "ion anisotropy and dipole  dipole interactions are discussed briefly .    recently",
    "this approach has been applied to the problem of classical ising spins on a pyrochlore lattice by yoshida et al @xcite .",
    "the properties of this classical ising model are quite different from the ones we report in this paper , especially the ground state degeneracy .",
    "the cva is simply the mean field approximation in case the basic cluster is a single site . in case",
    "the whole crystal is taken as the basic cluster the approximation becomes exact . in between one",
    "has to make an intelligent choice for the basic cluster : we have chosen the tetrahedron as the basic cluster .",
    "the tetrahedron is the smallest unit possessing all the symmetry of the lattice , it is the unit which seems to contain the basic magnetic properties of the spin system : the high frustration against order in case of af order .",
    "another appealing property is that one can easily diagonalize the spin hamiltonian for such a cluster , and the clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients are also easily calculated .",
    "the hexagons next to the triangles , are the smallest self - avoiding closed loops on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "so any description based only on the tetrahedral clusters , means we neglect these hexagon closed loops . in this sense",
    "our approximation is similar to that for a husimi tree  @xcite lattice , although our approximation does not suffer from the rather peculiar increase in the number of surface clusters , see also  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section :- theory ] we introduce and discuss qualitatively a hamiltonian describing the spins on this pyrochlore lattice .",
    "we transform the site hamiltonian to a hamiltonian for tetrahedra ( [ subsection :- tetrahedron - cluster ] ) . in section [ subsection:-5tetrahedra ]",
    "we discuss the spectrum of a 16 site cluster .",
    "we then derive in section [ subsection :- independent - tetrahedra ] the susceptibility for a pyrochlore lattice covered with non interacting tetrahedrons . in section [ subsection :- cva - theory ]",
    "we give some basic details of how we apply the cva to this heisenberg quantum system .",
    "we derive an expression for the ( linear ) susceptibility ( [ subsection :- susceptibility ] ) . in the next section [ section :- results - discussion ]",
    "we present first the critical temperature ( [ subsection :- tc ] ) and we present the zero temperature phase diagram for ferromagnetic and af _ nn _ interactions ( [ subsection :- gs_s=1_2 ] ) , and then present the principal numerical results on the susceptibility , magnetization as a functioon of magnetic field and temperature ( [ subsection :- m - t - h - ferro ] ) . in a final section [ section :- summary - conclusions ]",
    "we give a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "the general hamiltonian to describe spin ",
    "spin interactions is the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "we consider nearest ",
    "neighbour ( @xmath24 ) , and briefly we will also discuss qualitatively the consequences of next  nearest  neighbour ( @xmath25 ) , and next  next  nearest  neighbour ( @xmath26 ) exchange interactions .",
    "we assume that each of these interactions does not depend on the details of the interaction path in the pyrochlore structure : _ nn _ , _ nnn _ , and _ nnnn _ indicates by how many cation  cation links these cations are separated . from an analysis of esr spectra of cr@xmath27doped spinel",
    "znga@xmath210@xmath22 henning  @xcite derives the cr@xmath27cr@xmath27 exchange constants on this spinel b sublattice .",
    "these exchange constants show only small deviations  of about 10 %  from the average value of each type of exchange path .",
    "we also consider the possibility of local single ",
    "ion trigonal and tetragonal anisotropy . in case of the single ",
    "ion anisotropy the local trigonal field is along a local @xmath13 axis pointing to the center of the tetrahedron .",
    "the tetragonal anisotropy can be due to a tetragonal distortion , due to uni - axial pressure , of the cubic pyrochlore or spinel structures .",
    "it will be accompanied by a change in the two _ nn _ exchange interaction in the @xmath28 planes with respect to the other four _ nn _ exchange interactions in the @xmath29 planes ( see figure [ figure :- tetrahedron ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for this spin system in a magnetic field @xmath30 reads : @xmath31 the fourth contribution is a sum over the exchange interactions in the @xmath28 planes .",
    "we reserve capitals @xmath32 for the size of the cluster ( tetrahedron ) spins and small @xmath0 for the local atomic spins .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath30 in the last term is along a tetragonal axis ( see figure [ figure :- tetrahedron ] ) .",
    "the @xmath33 in the single ",

    "ion anisotropy vanishes in case @xmath1 .",
    "next let us briefly discuss the tetragonal anisotropy @xmath41 .",
    "when the tetrahedral anisotropy @xmath42 , the tetrahedron spin @xmath43 is aligned along a tetrahedral axis , and in case @xmath44 , this spin is rotating in the plane perpendicular to a tetrahedral axis .",
    "this term can also be written in terms of the single ",
    "site spins : @xmath45 the tetrahedral anisotropy interpolates between a ising model ( @xmath46 ) and an @xmath47 model to a heisenberg ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 model ( @xmath50 ) , by changing the ratio @xmath51 . in the next section we will get more insight in this term by writing the whole hamiltonian in terms of tetrahedron spins .        for the cva with the tetrahedron as a basic cluster we need the spin states of this tetrahedron .",
    "we define for tetrahedron @xmath52 the total spin as @xmath53 . for the @xmath54 term",
    "we introduce @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "one can now rewrite the exchange part and magnetic field of the original hamiltonian in terms of these tetrahedron spins @xmath57    the sum is over all tetrahedra in the lattice , including the ones which share a corner : so in case of the pyrochlore lattice there are @xmath58 cst .",
    "the sum over @xmath52 and @xmath59 is over all tetrahedra under the condition that they are _ nn _ or _ nnn _ tetrahedra .",
    "we have dropped terms of type @xmath60 , as these only add a constant energy to the hamiltonian .",
    "the first term gives the energy levels of an isolated tetrahedron , with an effective exchange in one tetrahedron of @xmath61 .",
    "this correction on @xmath24 should only be taken into account when also the the corresponding _ nn _ and _ nnn _ are taken into account : the second and third terms give these interactions between the total spins on _ nn _ and _ nnn _ tetrahedra .",
    "we note that several of these contributions ( @xmath41 , @xmath54 ) also appear in a summation of the dipole interaction within a tetrahedron : @xmath62+\\frac{2 d_d}{3}\\left[l^2 + r^2 - 3(l_z^2 + r_z^2)\\right ] + \\cdots \\label{eq :- dipole - dipole}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the interatomic distance in a tetrahedron .",

    ", we calculated the ground state of a finite cluster consisting of 4 outer tetrahedra each sharing a corner with the same central tetrahedron : 5 t super - tetrahedron .",
    "first let us briefly consider the energy levels of the tetrahedron .",
    "these are in figure [ figure :- energy - levels - s=1/2 ] and table  [ table :- energy - levels - s=1/2 ] . in case of nn af xchange interactions",
    "the ground state is a degenerate pair of singlets and in case of f interactions a quintet state @xmath68 .",
    "this pair of singlet states is split by the @xmath69 perturbation into two singelts , one with @xmath70 , @xmath71 : the two dimer singlet state , and the other @xmath72 , @xmath73 : the plaquette or tetrahedron singlet state .",
    "also the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction splits this singlet .",
    "we calculate the ground state energy in case of af interactions .",
    "we proceed as follows : the heisenberg hamiltonian is rewritten in terms of the tetrahedron spins @xmath74 , for the outer 4 tetrahedra .",
    "the eigenstates can easily be found using the clebsch - gordan coupling coefficients .",
    "these states are represented by the following set of quantum numbers : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the total spin and magnetic moment of the outer 4 tetrahedra , @xmath78 is the spin of the tetrahedra with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and @xmath81 of @xmath82 and @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are defined above .",
    "this basis is diagonal in the hamiltonian for the exchange interactions of the outer four tetrahedra .",
    "the 6 exchange interactions in the central tetrahedron have now to be considered separately . for @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , 7 , 6 , 5 , this can be done easily .",
    "for the other @xmath77 values we have chosen the following scheme in order to determine the ground state and first excited states : we choose a maximum value for @xmath74 , @xmath87 and @xmath76 , for @xmath88 and restrict the sum over all tetrahedron spins @xmath74 .",
    "that is , we restrict the number of singlet  triplet  quintet excitations in the cluster .",
    "our results for the ground state energy @xmath89 and singlet  triplet gap @xmath90 are in table [ table :- energy - levels - quintet - cluster ] .",
    "we find that the ground state is a set of 16 singlets .",
    "there is only coupling between the four outer tetrahedra by singlet ",
    "triplet excitations .",
    "we find @xmath91 for our t5 super - tetrahedron , which is @xmath92/site .",
    "this value is smaller then obtained for the 16 site super - tetrahedron of berg _ etal",
    "_  @xcite . the singlet  triplet gap is about @xmath93 , which means a decrease of about 25 % with respect to independent tetrahedra . in table",
    "[ table :- groundstate - stgap ] we have collected some data from recent calculations of these quantities .    the ground state degeneracy of the t5 cluster is determined by the 2fold degenerate ground - state of singlets of each of the 4 outer tetrahedra .",

    "when we extend this description to the complete pyrochlore lattice  which is from the point of view of the tetrahedra a diamond lattice ",
    "the ground state is @xmath94fold degenerate for a lattice of @xmath7 sites in case of af interactions .    in our calculations on the t5 cluster",
    "we observed a partial lifting of the degeneracy for certain choices of the restriction on the maximum number of excitations ( the size of hilbert space ) : to get the correct degeneracy one has to diagonalize the complete matrix . in this t5 cluster",
    "we do not find lifting of the degeneracy due to inter - tetrahedron interactions  @xcite .",

    "such singlet gap - states seem to appear as a function of the cluster size , or in a real system as a function of the spin ",
