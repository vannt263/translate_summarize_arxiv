    "quantum states and dynamics are commonly described with respect to a classical background reference frame . even defining a basis for the hilbert space of a quantum systems",
    "will in general make reference to a background frame . for example",
    ", the state @xmath0 for a spin@xmath1 particle may be defined as the spin parallel to the @xmath2-axis of a laboratory reference frame , and the @xmath3 state as spin parallel to the @xmath4-axis . in place of a classical background frame , one could use a second quantum system prepared in a state that indicates an orientation or alignment of a frame .",
    "the basis can then be defined with respect to this ` quantum reference frame . ' in this case , quantum information is encoded in degrees of freedom that are independent of the orientation of the laboratory reference frame .    in this paper",
    "we consider the process of changing quantum reference frames .",
    "that is , we begin with a situation wherein the quantum state of a system @xmath5 is defined with respect to a quantum reference frame @xmath6 , and we seek a procedure such that in the end we are describing the same quantum system with respect to a new quantum reference frame @xmath7 .",
    "we will focus on the scenario in which we have no prior knowledge of the orientation of the new quantum reference frame @xmath7 with respect to the original frame @xmath6 . as a concrete example , consider a quantum optics experiment where the quantum state of an atom is defined with respect to a phase reference in the form of a laser , denoted @xmath6 .",
    "we want to switch to a new phase reference @xmath7 , i.e. , a different laser , for which the phase relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is initially unknown . in order to describe our atom with respect to laser @xmath7 , some procedure",
    "must be performed that correlates the two lasers , ideally in a way that minimally affects the quantum state of the atom ; practically , this may involve phase locking the lasers @xcite .",
    "( note that there are other possible ways of defining a ` change of quantum reference frame , ' for example , when there are two reference frames for which the observer knows the orientation , changing reference frames is simply a matter of discarding the undesired reference frame .",
    "another interpretation of a ` change ' is a single reference frame transformed under a symmetry action . ) in this paper , we will investigate and quantify how the description of the quantum system @xmath5 changes as a result of this change of quantum reference frame process .",
    "this analysis provides the theoretical description of a process that occurs in numerous experimental guises @xcite , and may also form the first element of a relativity principle for quantum reference frames , which dictates how the description and dynamics of a physical system changes under a change of reference frame .    quantum reference frames in general will use finite resources , quantified by some parameter such as the hilbert space dimension of the frame . if our reference frames describe a continuum of orientations and we restrict the size ( e.g.hilbert space dimension ) of the frames , then reference frame states corresponding to different orientations will not be perfectly distinguishable .",
    "this uncertainty of the frame results in decoherence in information encoded using the reference frame  @xcite .",
    "in particular , as we will show , decoherence can result from a change of quantum reference frame .",
    "this decoherence would be important to limit in quantum experiments , and would also be a novel effect for a relativity principle . with a construction and characterisation of a ` change of quantum reference frame ' procedure , we quantitatively investigate the decoherence resulting from changing physical quantum reference frames .",
    "we interpret this appearance of decoherence in terms of a type of intrinsic decoherence , which is a proposed semiclassical phenomenon of quantum gravity arising from fundamental uncertainties in the background space @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] reviews the concepts and mathematical formalism of quantum reference frames .",
    "[ sec - introcorf ] presents the definition of the quantum operation describing a change of quantum reference frame , and an analysis of the properties of this quantum operation for some special cases of quantum reference frame .",
    "we also discuss the significance of the decoherence induced , and what consequences the procedure has . in secs .",

    "in this section , we review the conceptual and mathematical tools used in the description of a quantum state relative to a classical or quantum reference frame . we follow the notation of the review article  @xcite .",
    "physical quantities are often defined ( perhaps implicitly ) with respect to a non - dynamical background reference frame , e.g.a coordinate system .",
    "we want to use physical objects as reference frames and define quantities with respect to these . in this paper",
    "we consider the quantum case in which the physical objects are quantum systems which will be used as reference frames for other quantum systems .",
    "these ` quantum reference frames ' are therefore physical systems with their own dynamics , since they are included in the description just as any other quantum system .",
    "when using a physical system as a reference frame , well - defined relationships between the frame system and other systems can be meaningful even without a background reference frame .",
    "such quantities are called _ relational degrees of freedom _ , which we define in detail below .",
    "we also distinguish between a reference frame that has some correlation with the system of interest , which we call an _ implicated _ reference frame , and one that is completely uncorrelated with the system , which we call a _ nonimplicated _ reference frame .",
    "consider the example of the quantum optics experiment described in the introduction .",
    "an experiment is performed involving the state of an atom defined relative to a phase reference laser .",
    "this phase reference is _ implicated _ with the system of atoms .",
    "another independent laser , not phase locked with the first , is a nonimplicated frame for the system .",
    "a quantum reference frame is a quantum system and is therefore described by a state in an associated hilbert space .",
    "different quantum states in this hilbert space can describe different ` orientations ' of the quantum reference frame with respect to a hypothetical background frame . to formalise these notions",
    ", we will look at how to mathematically describe the manipulation of quantum reference frames and relational quantum degrees of freedom using techniques from the theory of group representations .    to set up the use of a quantum reference frame for encoding information in relational degrees of freedom",
    ", we begin with a background reference frame and a quantum system @xmath5 in the state @xmath10 with respect to this background frame . changes of orientation of this system relative to the background frame are described by a unitary representation @xmath11 of an element @xmath12 from a group @xmath13 which describes all possible changes of orientation .",
    "next , consider an additional system @xmath14 prepared in a quantum reference frame state @xmath15 , also defined with respect to the background reference frame .",
    "the reference frame state breaks a symmetry associated with @xmath13 , which has a representation as a unitary @xmath16 acting on the hilbert space of the quantum reference frame system @xmath17 .",
    "we can now consider using @xmath14 as a reference frame for @xmath5 .    to ensure that we are not still making accidental use of the background frame , we de - implicate it .",
    "this de - implication involves decorrelating the compound quantum system @xmath18 from the background frame . for a general state @xmath19 ,",
    "this is done by averaging the state over all rotations @xmath20 using @xmath21 , the unitary representation of @xmath13 on the combined ( tensor product ) hilbert space of @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting map @xmath22 is called the _",
    "g - twirl _ of the state , given by @xmath23 = \\int{\\mathrm{d}}\\mu(g ) u_{sr}(g ) \\rho u_{sr}(g)^\\dag\\label{eq - gtwirl}\\ ] ] where @xmath24:=u_{sr}(g)\\rho u_{sr}(g)^\\dag$ ] is the unitary map of the left action of the group and @xmath25 is the group - invariant haar measure of the group ( for example , the @xmath8 integration measure is @xmath26 ) .",
    "( note that although here we are considering @xmath27 , this g - twirl map can be generalised to any unitary representation . )",
    "we restrict our attention to compact lie groups , where the average is well - defined and bounded , although we note there exist similar methods for more general cases .",
    "we will call the states that are invariant under g - twirling @xmath28 ( including g - twirled states @xmath29 ) ` group - invariant ' or ` g - invariant ' .",
    "these states are well - defined independent of a background reference frame .",
    "note that a @xmath13-twirled state may be mixed even if the original state @xmath19 was pure .",
    "relational degrees of freedom are those which are independent of any background frame . given a system state @xmath10 and a quantum reference frame @xmath30 , it is not immediately obvious what are the relational degrees of freedom in the @xmath13-twirled joint state @xmath31 . in the following , we will define the hilbert space subsystems associated with these relational degrees of freedom , following  @xcite .",
    "again , for simplicity of the mathematics , we will consider symmetries corresponding to compact lie groups such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , many of the concepts developed can be directly transferred to general groups and reference frames .",
    "the unitary representation of a compact lie group on a hilbert space @xmath32 consists of a number of inequivalent representations called ` charge sectors ' .",
    "the hilbert space can be decomposed into a tensor sum of these charge sectors , each labelled by @xmath33 ( for example , @xmath33 may be total spin in a representation of @xmath9 on a collection of spins ) .",
    "each of these charge sectors may be a _",
    "reducible _ representation , which can be further decomposed into a hilbert subsystem @xmath34 carrying an _ irreducible _ representation ( ` irrep ' ) , and a ` multiplicity subsystem ' @xmath35 which carries the trivial representation and whose dimension indicates how many copies of the irreducible representation exists in the charge sector @xmath33 .",
    "the representation on the full hilbert space then has the structure @xmath36 where @xmath33 ranges over all the irreps ( charge sectors ) of @xmath13 that are supported on @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath13-twirl map is closely related to the representations of the group , in that it averages an input state @xmath19 over the unitary action of every element in the symmetry group .",
    "decomposing this map following , we have @xmath37.\\label{eq - gtwirldecomp}\\ ] ] the terms in this operation are defined as follows .",
    "first , @xmath38 is the projector onto the subspace @xmath39 , the charge sector @xmath33 .",
    "this removes all coherences between the charge sectors .",
    "next , @xmath40 is the completely depolarising channel , which is a trace preserving map that takes every density operator to a scalar multiple of the identity operator on the space @xmath34 .",
    "this is the effect of an average of the action of a unitary group on an irrep .",
    "finally @xmath41 is the identity map on the multiplicity subsystem @xmath35 .",
    "we can now identify the relational degrees of freedom , unaffected by @xmath13-twirl , as the multiplicity subsystem @xmath35 .",
    "the degrees of freedom in the subsystems @xmath34 are defined only with respect to a background frame , and are completely decohered by the @xmath13-twirl .",
    "[ sec - rfquant ]    in this section we describe how to define useful quantum reference frame states .",
    "a reference frame breaks a symmetry by indicating an orientation .",
    "the set of possible orientations is associated with a symmetry group @xmath13 . to construct a set of reference states , we begin with a _ fiducial state _ @xmath42 , which serves as a quantum reference frame oriented with respect to a background frame and which we choose to associate with the identity @xmath43 . given this fiducial state we can construct states corresponding to other orientations @xmath20 by generating the states in the orbit of @xmath42 under the group action @xmath44 , yielding @xmath45 for all @xmath20 .",
    "such states obey the relation @xmath46 , and we say that they transform _ covariantly _ under the action of the symmetry group .",
    "quantum reference frames generally use limited finite resources quantified by some parameter @xmath47 .",
    "a fundamental example of a size parameter is the dimensionality of the hilbert space @xmath48 , constraining the number of charge sectors @xmath49 under the representation of the group ( however , this is not the only choice of size parameter ) .",
    "we define the notation @xmath50 to denote a @xmath13-covariant state @xmath51 with size parameter @xmath52 . where it is unnecessary to indicate size , we may suppress the size parameter .",
    "the groups considered in the theory of this paper are compact lie groups , meaning the reference frames can take one of a continuum of orientations in a closed manifold . with only finite - dimensional representations of such groups , reference frame states for different orientations in a lie group can not all be perfectly distinguishable .",
    "consequently , a state will have a mean orientation @xmath12 , but also possess an uncertainty in orientation .",
    "we would like reference frame states to have a well - defined classical limit in which the overlap of states with different orientations becomes zero as the size parameter @xmath47 increases to infinity , i.e. , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the delta function on @xmath13 defined by @xmath55 for any continuous function @xmath56 of @xmath13 @xcite , and @xmath57 is the dimension of the hilbert space spanned by @xmath58 .    in the finite size case , one may wish to maximise the distinguishability of the quantum reference frame used for a given size constraint @xmath52 .",
    "distinguishability can be quantified using maximum likelihood or fidelity measures @xcite .",
    "because we also want the reference frame states to become ideal ( perfectly distinguishable ) in the classical limit , we want this distinguishability to scale with @xmath57 ( see @xcite regarding asymptotic measures ) . a useful choice of reference frame states for a group @xmath13 on @xmath57 dimensions are the _ maximum likelihood states _",
    "@xcite , denoted @xmath59 or @xmath60 ( the latter following the notation @xmath50 ) , as these states are optimal for a range of operational tasks involving reference frames .",
    "these pure states transform covariantly and have the property that @xmath61 i.e.these have uniform support over their hilbert space , which will make these states useful in the construction of measurements ( povms ) .",
    "the form of a maximum likelihood state is specific to the group @xmath13 and hilbert space @xmath17 .",
    "we will consider quantum reference frame hilbert spaces @xmath17 for which the decomposition of just @xmath17 is such that @xmath62 for every charge sector @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "then the maximum likelihood states take the simple form @xcite @xmath63 where in this case @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a normalised maximally entangled state on @xmath39 in some pair of bases @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the set @xmath68 includes the charge sectors on which this state has support and is determined by the size parameter @xmath52 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise the machinery to cases where @xmath69 ; see refs .  @xcite . for more details regarding properties of these states",
    "see ref .",
    "we will be using examples of maximum likelihood states as quantum reference frames in secs .",
    "[ sec - phaseex ] and [ sec - examplesu2 ] .",
    "one essential task when using quantum reference frames is to implicate a quantum reference frame for a system state @xmath10 while de - implicating the background frame , called _ relationally encoding _ @xmath10 . a second essential task is to do the reverse : extract the information from this encoding by removing the quantum reference frame and _ recovering _ a @xmath70 defined relative to a background frame . in this section",
    "we define the operations that do these tasks .    given a quantum system @xmath5 defined relative to a background frame , we want to introduce a quantum reference frame @xmath14 and de - implicate the background frame .",
    "this is achieved by the _ encoding map _ @xmath71 eq .",
    "results in a g - invariant state @xmath72 which is called the relational encoding of @xmath10 using @xmath30 . the map can be implemented by applying to @xmath73 , where the unitary representation on the compound hilbert space @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "it can also be implemented by the projection to charge sectors and depolarisation of irreps given by .",
    "now , if we are given an encoded state but wish to recover the state @xmath10 in terms of a background frame , this usually can not be done perfectly @xcite .",

    "@xmath12 ' relative to the background frame , then the orientation of the state is corrected by a transformation by @xmath79 .",
    "the finite size of a quantum reference token means that for symmetries described by compact lie groups , the token is an imperfect reference frame .",
    "consequently , the use of a quantum reference frame causes an effective decoherence to the information in @xmath10 .",
    "we can describe this decoherence by composing and to produce @xmath80.\\label{eq - remap}\\ ] ] this map takes the form of a noise map on @xmath10 , describing a mixing of this state over a distribution of unitaries determined by the distribution @xmath81 .",
    "we want to minimise this decoherence by optimising the recovery operation to produce the state closest to @xmath10 possible from an encoding @xmath82 .",
    "the figure of merit used to quantify this optimisation is the average entanglement fidelity of an arbitrary input ensemble of states @xmath83 into @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the recovery map is generically near - optimal in the sense that if the average fidelity of an optimal recovery map @xmath85 is @xmath86 then the recovery map @xmath84 has average fidelity @xmath87 , i.e.the error @xmath88 is never greater than twice that of the best recovery operation @xcite .",
    "we now consider the central problem of changing quantum reference frames .",
    "we begin this section with a qualitative discussion of the issues regarding measurement when changing reference frames , including an example to illustrate the central ideas .",
    "if the reader prefers , this subsection  [ sec - introchangingrfs ] can be skipped in favour of the mathematical formulation in  [ sec - genresults ] .      as an example , also investigated in @xcite , consider a particle @xmath5 in one dimension , with position defined relative to a reference frame consisting of another particle @xmath6 which provides an origin .",
    "introduce a second particle , @xmath7 , which we would like to use as a new reference frame for @xmath5 .",
    "classically , this seems straightforward : the position of @xmath5 described in terms of @xmath7 will differ by the relative position of the two reference frames , @xmath89 .",
    "( note that this relational quantity is independent of any choice of origin . ) after adjusting our description of the position of @xmath5 by this difference , particle @xmath6 can be subsequently discarded .    in this classical scenario",
    ", we can implicitly assume that the relative position of the two frames , @xmath89 , is known a priori .",
    "in the quantum scenario we consider , the reference frame @xmath7 is initially deimplicated , meaning that it is uncorrelated with either @xmath6 or @xmath5 ; in general we would require a measurement to determine such relationships .",
    "there are two natural options for doing this .",
    "the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath7 can be directly measured , or the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be measured ( giving us the relational quantity @xmath89 for adjusting the description of @xmath5 ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the quantum mechanical case now , and first consider a semiclassical configuration in which the @xmath6 and @xmath7 reference frames are in position eigenstates and the measurements are ideal projective measurements of relative position .",
    "the @xmath5 state is arbitrary .",
    "for the first measurement option , the relative position of @xmath5 and @xmath7 is measured .",
    "the wavefunction of @xmath5 will in general not be a position eigenstate , and therefore will be disturbed by a measurement of relative position ; specifically , a projective measurement of @xmath90 in the situation where @xmath7 is in a position eigenstate will collapse the wavefunction of @xmath5 to a position eigenstate as well .",
    "this complete disturbance is not consistent with what we expect of a change of reference frame . instead ,",
    "consider an alternative , where the relative position @xmath89 of the two reference frames @xmath6 and @xmath7 is measured , and the system @xmath5 is not involved .",
    "after obtaining a well - defined value of @xmath89 , we can combine this with preexisting correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 to obtain a correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath7 , since the associated operators for @xmath91 and @xmath92 commute .",
    "this act of measurement has implicated the reference frame @xmath7 , and we can now discard @xmath6 .",
    "the new description of the state @xmath5 will have changed by @xmath89 due to the difference in position of reference frame @xmath7 versus @xmath6 , thus accomplishing a change of quantum reference frame .",
    "there are however some subtleties in this procedure . in the above example @xmath6 and @xmath7 were position eigenstates and the measurements were projective to these position eigenstates , allowing for arbitrarily good precision in the relational variables",
    ". in general , quantum reference frames for generic degrees of freedom will not possess such ideal , perfectly - distinguishable configurations due to their bounded size  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the bounded nature of the @xmath6 reference frame results in decoherence to the quantum system @xmath10 after @xmath6 is discarded . if the measurement is also only capable of projecting @xmath89 to a state with finite variance in position , then discarding the frame @xmath6 yields a system wavefunction correlated with an imperfect reference frame @xmath7 .",
    "recovering @xmath10 from quantum frame @xmath7 will then also cause decoherence to the system .    in the next section",
    ", we will formalise these concepts and problems , and construct a general framework for describing a change of quantum reference frame . in particular , because we use quantum states to indicate orientations in a continuous group , in many cases we can not perfectly distinguish nonorthogonal states for different reference frame orientations .",
    "one of the main limiting factors for distinguishability is the dimension of the hilbert space used for the reference frame .",
    "the imperfect distinguishability results in an uncertainty in the orientation given by a quantum reference frame , leading to decoherence when we change the quantum frame used for encoding a quantum system .      in this section ,",
    "we formally develop the change of quantum reference frame procedure and then calculate the final states for a physically relevant class of initial states .",
    "we can formulate the notion of changing quantum reference frames as an operational task .",
    "an observer possesses a quantum system @xmath5 and implicated quantum reference frame @xmath6 ; the initial state of this combined system is given by the encoding @xmath93 given in eq .  .",
    "this observer wishes to use a second , initially non - implicated , quantum reference frame @xmath7 .",
    "the task of the observer is to use the @xmath7 quantum system as a quantum reference frame for the system @xmath5 , and to discard the initial reference frame @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the observer seeks to end up with a new encoding @xmath94 of the system @xmath5 with respect to @xmath7 , where we note that the state of the system @xmath70 may have changed as a result of this procedure .",
    "we measure success at this operational task by determining how close ( relative to some natural figure of merit , such as fidelity or trace distance ) is the final encoded state @xmath70 compared with the original @xmath10 .    as well as",
    "being of theoretical interest , this occurs in several experimental guises @xcite .",
    "for example , in switching phase or clock reference lasers from a locked laser @xmath6 to an uncorrelated laser @xmath7 , one first needs to phase lock the two lasers @xcite ( this has been extended to issues in optical teleportation @xcite ) . in another example , determining the relative phase of two bose ",
    "einstein condensates @xcite can be interpreted as correlating quantum reference frames @xcite .    in the following sections , we develop such a procedure based on a relational measurement between the old and new quantum reference frames , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we then consider how the encoded state on @xmath5 is affected by this procedure , and quantify how well this procedure performs at the above operational task .",
    "the core element of the procedure to change quantum reference frames is a relational measurement of the two reference frames @xmath6 and @xmath7 that determines a relative orientation @xmath95 between these two frames  @xcite . performing this measurement leads to a correlation in orientation of the two reference frames . because there was initially correlation between frame @xmath5 and the system @xmath6",
    ", we obtain correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "now we can discard the @xmath6 reference frame by tracing and use @xmath7 as the new quantum reference frame .",
    "if the reference frames use finite resources such as finite hilbert space dimension to indicate orientations , we expect decoherence in the post - measurement state .",
    "the fact that it is a relational measurement means that it can be made independent of any background reference frame . in the following ,",
    "we construct the relational povm and update map for this measurement , and prove key properties of the construction .",

    "a povm allows us to calculate the probabilities of the @xmath97 outcomes for an input state , but here we are equally interested in the post - measurement state .",

    "balanced homodyne detection is a measurement technique in quantum optics in which two beams are incident on either side of a beamsplitter .",
    "the angle of incidence with the plane of reflection is @xmath332 so that reflected and transmitted beams are on two paths , but these can not mix with the incident beams . the beams on the two transmission paths are then measured with photon counters , returning numbers of photons @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "therefore the projected state is a simultaneous number eigenstate for each path .",
    "it has total photon number @xmath335 , and difference in photons @xmath336 where @xmath337 to @xmath261 in integer steps @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the outcome @xmath338 is related to the relative phase of the two beams .",
    "if @xmath261 is large , there are more outcome possibilities , admitting a greater resolution of relative phase .",

    "if it is , it provides an immediately experimentally accessible way to study the change of quantum reference frame procedure for phase references .",
    "indeed , there exists a coherent state amplification scheme using balanced homodyne measurement @xcite , which may be considered as a specific change of quantum phase reference operation , from one coherent state to an amplified coherent state .",
    "the standard treatment of balanced homodyne detection is that one input is the quantum state with a phase to be measured , and the second input is a classical ` local oscillator ' , providing the phase reference for the measurement @xcite . in the scenario suggested in this section , whereby two quantum phase references are directly measured in a single measurement , we would need to consider the general situation where each input state is of finite size .",
    "also we want to analyse the possibility of measurement of two phase eigenstates , as well as two coherent states .",
    "since this view of a balanced homodyne detection treats both input beams equally as quantum states , the interpretation of the measurement is then that it measures relative phase of the two optical states , and requires no phase reference to do so .",

    "from we saw that the @xmath4 variance and expectation value of phase eigenstates depends on their cutoff and phase orientation . from our picture of phase eigenstates in phase space this overlap is the outer part of the pseudo - distribution of a phase eigenstate , without the inner part of the state .",
    "since this becomes an isolated packet away from the origin , it allows some accuracy in correlation of a position measurement with the cosine of the phase .",
    "notice however , as @xmath261 falls to @xmath380 , the state becomes a complete phase eigenstate , so the overlap produces great inaccuracy mapping position to phase .      in each case of study in this section",
    ", balanced homodyne detection provides a relational measurement of a parameter related to relative phase or quadrature . since balanced homodyne detection projects to total photon number @xmath261 and a higher photon number offers more possible outcomes @xmath345 ,",
    "large coherent states are better suited to this type of measurement than phase eigenstates .",

    "however , only the relative phase modulo @xmath320 is measured .",
    "a final remark on the viability of balanced homodyne detection for use in the change of quantum reference frame procedure is that the homodyne detection destroys the state by absorbing the photons , so we would not be able to continue with the remainder of the change of reference frame procedure .",
    "perhaps an extended optical setup could be utilised to produce an output state , similar to the balanced homodyne coherent state amplification scheme by @xcite ."
