    "building on the classical fields of graph theory , statistical physics , and nonlinear dynamics , as well as leveraging the recent advances in collecting large - scale network data , the field of network dynamics has flourished over the last 15 years .",
    "much of the current effort in this area is driven by the premise that understanding the structure , the function , and the relation between the two will help explain the workings of natural systems and facilitate the design of engineered systems with expanded capability , optimized performance , and enhanced robustness  @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive studies on this structure - dynamics relation  @xcite in the context of network synchronization  @xcite , reaction and/or diffusion dynamics  @xcite , as well as other types of dynamical processes on networks  @xcite .",
    "many of these studies have led to systematic methods for enhancing the dynamics through network - structural modifications .",
    "examples include controlling synchronization patterns of oscillators  @xcite or target wave patterns of excitable elements  @xcite , suppressing epidemic spreading  @xcite , and enhancing the stability of synchronous oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the latter can be achieved by adjusting coupling strengths , removing nodes , rewiring links , and even removing links and adding nodes , and has been demonstrated in applications , with examples including systems of space - filling bearings  @xcite and coupled laser networks  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question at the core of the structure - dynamics relation is that of optimization : what network structure optimizes the dynamics of the system for a given function and what are the properties of such a network ?",
    "the significance of addressing this question is two fold .",
    "first , knowledge on the properties of optimized structures informs system architecture design . in power - grid networks , for example , the structures that maximize the stability of synchronous operation of power generators  a required condition for power grids to operate ",
    "could potentially be used to devise effective strategies for upgrading the system  @xcite .",
    "second , the identification of the network structures that guarantee the best fitness of natural complex systems can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying their evolution .",
    "examples of such systems include neuronal networks , whose synaptic connectivity structure is believed to have been optimized through evolution or learning for categorization tasks  @xcite , synchronization efficiency  @xcite , dynamical complexity  @xcite , information transfer efficiency  @xcite , and/or wiring cost  @xcite .",
    "the question of optimizing the network structure can be conceptualized as the problem of maximizing / minimizing a measure of dynamical stability , robustness , or performance over all possible configurations of links connecting the dynamical units .    here",
    "we demonstrate that optimized dynamics is often highly sensitive to perturbations applied to the structure of the network . for concreteness , we focus on optimizing the stability against small changes in the network s dynamical states , among all networks with a given number of nodes and links .",
    "we consider dynamical states in which the ( time - dependent ) states of the individual nodes are identical across the network , such as the states of agreement in consensus dynamics , states of synchronized periodic or chaotic oscillations , and states of equilibrium in diffusion processes .",
    "the appearance of sensitivity to structural perturbations generally depends on the class of networks and the nature of perturbations considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) , and here we establish the following two types of sensitivity :    1 .   _ sensitivity of undirected networks to changing the number of nodes and links within the class of networks with optimized structure _ ( lower right red box in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) .",
    "this class consists of those networks characterized as having the inimum possible size of the largest omponents in their omplement ( mcc ) among all networks with the same number of nodes and links .",
    "we provide a full analytical characterization of the mcc networks of arbitrary finite size and study their behavior as the network size approaches infinity .",
    "for many combinations of the number of nodes and links , an mcc network actually satisfies a stronger condition , under which node groups of _ equal _ sizes are fully connected to each other , but have no internal links .",
    "such networks are referred to as _ uniform complete multi - partite _ ( ucm ) networks , and here we show that the ucm networks are optimal .",
    "sensitivity of optimal directed networks to generic structural perturbations , i.e. , small random changes to the link weights _",
    "( upper left red box in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) .",
    "we show that the tendency of optimization to induce spectral degeneracy underlies this sensitivity , which we expect to observe in many applications because spectral degeneracy appears to be common in real networks  @xcite .",
    "we also show that , even when the network has only approximate degeneracy ( and thus approximate optimality ) , it exhibits the same sensitivity , at least approximately .",
    "in addition to these two cases of sensitivity , we have results on the absence of sensitivity in the other two cases ( blue boxes in fig .  [",
    "fig : summary ] ) . for networks under non - generic structural perturbations ( bottom row in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) , our results provide a basis for a comprehensive theory of their spectral sensitivity / non - sensitivity . for networks under generic structural perturbations ( top row in fig .  [ fig : summary ] ) , we have a unified theory that determines the scaling of their spectrum with respect to the size of perturbations .",
    "we illustrate the implications of our results using a general class of diffusively coupled systems for which we establish that their network spectrum determines the stability and other aspects of the dynamics to be optimized .",
    "specific cases we analyze include the rate of diffusion over networks , the critical threshold for turing instability in networks of activator - inhibitor systems , and the synchronization stability in power grids and in networks of chaotic oscillators .",
    "we aim to address a wide range of network dynamics in a unified way . for this purpose",
    "we consider the dynamics of a network of coupled dynamical units governed by the following general equation with pairwise interactions : @xmath0 for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of dynamical units ( nodes ) , @xmath3 is the column vector of state variables for the @xmath4-th unit at time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes the time derivative of @xmath7 .",
    "the function @xmath8 is generally nonlinear and describes how the dynamics of unit @xmath4 is influenced by the other units through intermediate variables @xmath9 , where @xmath10 indicates no interaction .",
    "this means that the dynamics of an isolated unit is described by @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath13 is the same for all @xmath14 ( or more precisely , that @xmath12 is invariant under any permutation of @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , the topology of the interaction network and the strength of individual pairwise coupling are not encoded in @xmath12 , but rather in the @xmath16-dependence of the coupling function @xmath17 .",
    "this extends the framework introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and can describe a wide range of dynamical processes on networks , including consensus protocol  @xcite , diffusion over networks , emergence of turing patterns in networked activator - inhibitor systems  @xcite , relaxation in certain fluid networks  @xcite , and synchronization of power generators  @xcite as well as other coupled identical and non - identical oscillators  @xcite .    for the class of systems described by eq .",
    ", we consider _ network - homogneous states _ given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 satisfies the equation for an isolated unit , @xmath20 .",
    "each of the example systems mentioned above exhibits such a state : uniform agreement in consensus protocols , a synchronous dynamics in oscillator networks , uniform occupancy in network diffusion , uniform concentration in coupled activator - inhibitor systems , and the equilibrium in fluid networks .",
    "note that certain non - homogeneous states can also be represented by such a solution by changing the frame of reference .    to facilitate the stability analysis ,",
    "we make two general assumptions on the nature of node - to - node interactions when the system is close to the network - homogeneous state : ( a-1 ) the interactions are `` diffusive , '' in the sense that the coupling strength between two nodes , @xmath21 , is to first order proportional to the difference between their states , @xmath22 .",
    "in particular we assume that the coupling strength vanishes as the node states become equal .",
    "( a-2 ) there is a constant coupling matrix @xmath23 encoding the structure of the network of interactions , in the sense that the proportionality coefficient ( the `` diffusion constant '' ) in assumption ( a-1 ) can be written as @xmath24 , where the scalar @xmath25 represents the strength of coupling from node @xmath14 to node @xmath4 , and the vector - valued function @xmath26 is independent of @xmath4 and @xmath14 . under these assumptions ,",
    "we define a stability function @xmath27 for each complex - valued parameter @xmath28 ( see appendix  [ sec : stab_func ] ) , which captures the factors determining the stability of the network - homogeneous state but is independent of the network structure .",
    "this function , referred to as a master stability function in the literature , was originally derived for a general class of systems that is different from the one we consider here  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the network structure on the stability is only through the ( possibly complex ) eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xmath29 , defined by @xmath30 note that @xmath29 always has a null eigenvalue @xmath31 associated with the eigenvector @xmath32 , which corresponds to the mode of instability that does not affect the condition @xmath33 . the maximum lyapunov exponent measuring the stability of the network - homogeneous state is then given by @xmath34 i.e.",
    ", it is stable if @xmath35 , and unstable if @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , @xmath37 gives the asymptotic rate of exponential convergence or divergence .",
    "we first consider the following fundamental question : _ for a given number of nodes representing dynamical units , and a given number of links with identical weights , what is the assignment of links that maximize the rate of convergence to a network - homogeneous state ? _ we may assume @xmath25 to be binary ( @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) without loss of generality , since any link weight @xmath40 can be accounted for by the stability function @xmath27 ( see appendix  [ sec : stab_func ] ) .",
    "we additionally assume that there is no self - interaction , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "the binary - weight assumption is used in the following unless explicitly relaxed to extend our results to weighted networks .      for the class of networks with a fixed number of undirected links @xmath42",
    ", we have the additional constraint that the matrix @xmath43 is symmetric .",
    "this constraint can arise from the symmetry of the physical processes underlying the interaction represented by a link , such as the diffusion of chemicals through a channel connecting reactor cells in a chemical reaction network . in this case",

    "we discuss implications of these cases for concrete examples of physical networked systems .    for undirected networks ,",

    "typically the asymptotic rate of convergence @xmath293 is a smooth , monotonically increasing function of @xmath47 , and thus the maximized convergence rate exhibits the cusp - like dependence on the number of nodes and links .",
    "below we list specific cases in which sensitivity is observed in @xmath293 or a related quantity :    1 .   for networks of phase oscillators , including models of power - grid networks , the convergence rate to a frequency - synchronized , phase - locked state is a function of the laplacian eigenvalue @xmath294 associated with the matrix @xmath295 of effective interactions between generators . while @xmath47 is generally different from @xmath294 , it is strongly correlated with @xmath294 , and hence to @xmath296 .",
    "we thus expect to observe sensitive dependence of @xmath296 , which is indeed confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : example - systems]_a _ for power - grid networks with prescribed network topology and realistic parameters for the generators and other electrical components in the system .",
    "2 .   in addition to the asymptotic convergence rate @xmath296 , sensitive dependence can be observed for the convergence rate in the transient dynamics of the network , which depends not only on @xmath47 but on all laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : example - systems]_b _ using the example of coupled optoelectronic oscillator networks  @xcite .",
    "another physical quantity that can exhibit sensitive dependence is the critical coupling threshold for the stability of the network - homogeneous state in systems with a global coupling strength @xmath260 . in such systems , the functions @xmath17 are proportional to @xmath260 . for identical oscillators capable of chaotic synchronization ,",
    "the minimum coupling strength for stable synchronization is inversely proportional to @xmath47 . for the activator - inhibitor systems  @xcite",
    ", the parameter @xmath260 is interpreted as the common diffusivity constant associated with the process of diffusion over individual links . as @xmath260 is decreased from a value sufficiently large for the uniform concentration state to be stable , there is a critical diffusivity , @xmath297 , corresponding to the onset of turing instability , and this @xmath298 is inversely proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "such a critical threshold thus depends sensitively on the link density of the network ( as illustrated for the activator - inhibitor systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : example - systems]_c _ ) as well as on the number of nodes .    for directed networks , the sensitivity of laplacian eigenvalues under generic perturbations is typically inherited by the convergence rate @xmath296 for many systems governed by eq .  .",
    "in fact , @xmath296 would have the same sensitivity as the laplacian eigenvalue @xmath299 whenever @xmath296 has a smooth ( non - constant ) dependence on @xmath299 near the unperturbed values of @xmath299 .",
    "figure  [ fig : generic_perturbation_phys ] illustrates the sharp contrast between sensitive and non - sensitive cases using the example of synchronization in networks of chaotic optoelectronic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the sensitive dependence of collective dynamics on the network structure , characterized here by a derivative that diverges at the optimal point , has several implications . on the one hand",
    ", it implies that the dynamics can be manipulated substantially by small structural adjustments , which we suggest has the potential to lead to new control approaches based on modifying the effective structure of the network in real time ; indeed , the closer the system is to being optimal , the larger the range of manipulation possible with the same amount of structural adjustment . on the other hand , the observed cusp - like behavior imposes constraints on how close one can get to the ultimate optimum in practice ;",
    "given an optimal network configuration at the tip of a cusp , a small parameter mismatch or deactivation / activation of nodes or links can have a significant impact on the optimality .",
    "it is insightful to interpret our results in the context of living systems .",
    "the apparent conundrum that follows from this study is that biological networks ( such as genetic , neuronal , and ecological ones ) are believed to have evolved under the pressure to both optimize fitness and be robust to structural perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the latter means that the networks would not undergo significant loss of function ( hence of optimality ) when perturbed .",
    "for example , a mutation in a bacterium ( i.e. , a structural change to a genetic network ) causes the resulting strain to be nonviable in only a minority of cases  @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation is that much of the robustness of living systems comes from the plasticity they acquire from optimizing their fitness under varying conditions . in the case of bacterial organisms , for example",
    ", it is believed that the reason most of their genes are not essential for a given environmental condition is because they are required under different conditions .",
    "bacteria kept under stable conditions , such as intracellular ones , have evolved to virtually have only those genes essential under that condition  @xcite ; they are a close analog of optimization of a fixed objective function considered here .",
    "while there is therefore no conflict between our results and the optimization - robustness trade - off expected for biological networks , investigating the equivalent of the sensitive dependence on network structure in the case of varying conditions or varying objective function would likely provide further insights .",
    "a complementary example of interplay between optimization and robustness is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that optimization can drive a population to extinction through a global bifurcation in the structure of the state space .",
    "in general , the optimization - robustness relation may depend on the type of robustness considered . in this study we focused on",
    "how stable a state is , and hence on how resistant the network is to small changes in its dynamical state , which can be regarded as a form of robustness ( terminology used , for example , in ref .",
    "it is quite remarkable that , in seeking to optimize the network for this `` dynamical '' robustness it would lose `` structural '' robustness ( i.e. , how resistant the network is to changes in the network structure ) .",
    "but is the observed sensitive dependence on network structure really a sign of non - robustness ?",
    "the answer is both yes and no .",
    "it is `` yes '' in the sense that , because of the non - differentiability of this dependence , small parameter changes cause stability to change significantly .",
    "it is `` no '' in the sense that , because the cusps appear at valleys rather than at peaks , the stability in the vicinity of the local best parameter choices are still generally better than at locations further away ( that is , specific parameters lead to significant improvement but not to significant deterioration ) . by considering both the dynamical and structural robustness , we can interpret our results as a manifestation of the `` robust - yet - fragile '' property that has been suggested as a general feature of complex systems  @xcite .    finally , it is instructive to compare the sensitive dependence on network structure with the phenomenon of chaos , which can exhibit multiple forms of sensitive dependence  @xcite .",
    "sensitive dependence on initial conditions , where small changes in the initial state lead to large changes in the subsequent evolution of the trajectories , is a phenomenon that concerns the phase space of a fixed system .",
    "sensitive dependence on parameters may concern a similar change in the evolution of trajectories across different systems even when the initial conditions are the same , as in the case of the map @xmath300 when @xmath301 rather than @xmath302 is changed .",
    "but sensitive dependence on parameters may also concern a change in the nature of the dynamics , which has a qualitative rather than just quantitative impact on the trajectories ; this is the case for the logistic map @xmath303 , whose behavior can change from chaotic to periodic by arbitrarily small changes in @xmath304 and , moreover , whose lyapunov exponent exhibits a cusp - like dependence on @xmath304 within each periodic window .",
    "the latter concerns sensitive dependence of the stability measure of the states under consideration , and therefore is a low - dimensional analog of the sensitive dependence of network dynamics on network structural parameters investigated here . in the case of networks , however , they emerge not from bifurcations but instead from optimization .",
    "much in the same way the discovery of sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the context of ( what is now known as ) chaos set constraints on long - term predictability and on the reliability of simple models for weather forecast  @xcite , the sensitive dependence on network structure calls for a careful evaluation of the constraints it sets on predictability and model reliability in the presence of noise and uncertainties in real network systems .",

    "an argument based on the jordan canonical form of @xmath29 similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite then leads to a stability function @xmath27 , defined for given ( complex - valued ) auxiliary parameter @xmath28 as the maximum lyapunov exponent of the solution @xmath322 of @xmath323\\boldsymbol{\\eta},\\ ] ] which can be used to determine the stability of the network - homogeneous state .",
    "a key aspect of this approach is that the functional form of @xmath27 does not depend on the network structure , which influences the stability only through the laplacian eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the exponential rate of convergence or divergence is given by @xmath324 for the perturbation mode corresponding to the @xmath14-th ( possibly complex ) eigenvalue @xmath299 of the laplacian matrix @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the perturbation mode with the slowest convergence ( or fastest divergence ) determines the stability of the network - homogeneous state through @xmath325 in eq .  .",
    "for a system with a global coupling strength parameter @xmath260 , such as the networks of identical oscillators and networks of activator - inhibitor systems described in secs .",
    "s1b and s1c , respectively , the derivative @xmath326 in the condition ( a-2 ) above is proportional to @xmath260 , and @xmath26 can be chosen to include the factor @xmath260 ( thus making the stability function @xmath327 dependent on @xmath260 ) .",
    "similarly , when considering networks with equal link weights @xmath260 for all links ( as in the optimization problem described in sec .",
    "[ sec : opt ] ) , @xmath260 can be factored out of @xmath25 and absorbed into @xmath26 in the condition ( a-2 ) , so that @xmath25 represents a binary network .",
    "we note that the class of systems treated in ref .",
    "@xcite is a special case of our formulation in which @xmath8 depends linearly on the @xmath328 variables and the coupling function @xmath17 is proportional to the difference in ( some function of ) the state of the nodes ( see sec .",
    "we also note that the same stability condition @xmath329 is derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for a general class of systems that is different from the class of systems treated here .",
    "this general class does not include the networks of coupled second - order phase oscillators or power generators described in sec .",
    "s1a , since one of the assumptions on the coupling term is not satisfied .",
    "another advantage of our formulation is that the assumptions on the nature of pairwise interactions encoded in the coupling functions @xmath17 are intuitive and have clear relation to the network structure encoded in the adjacency matrix @xmath43 .",
    "for a given undirected network with @xmath2 nodes and @xmath49 links , suppose that the mean degree @xmath92 is a nonnegative integer .",
    "here we show that @xmath47 attains the upper bound in eq .   if and only if the network is a ucm network .",
    "suppose first that @xmath330 .",
    "this implies that we have @xmath331 .",
    "also , by the assumption we made above , the mean degree of the complement , @xmath332 , is an integer , and thus we have @xmath333 .",
    "then , eq .   becomes @xmath334 since this implies that the maximum and the mean degree of the complement match , i.e. , @xmath335 , all nodes must have the same degree @xmath336 in the complement .",
    "now consider a connected component of the complement .",
    "on the one hand , the maximum laplacian eigenvalue of this component is at most the maximum laplacian eigenvalue of the entire network , @xmath337 . on the other hand , it is at least @xmath338 since the maximum degree of the component is @xmath336 ( by applying proposition 3.9.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite to the component ) . combining these",
    ", we conclude that the maximum laplacian eigenvalue of this component equals @xmath338 . since the maximum laplacian eigenvalue is the maximum degree plus one , applying the second part of proposition 3.9.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite to this component , we conclude that the size of the component is @xmath339 .",
    "since each node in this component has degree @xmath336 , this component must be fully connected .",
    "note that these conclusions apply to any connected component of the complement , which implies that the number of nodes must satisfy @xmath85 for some positive integer @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the complement consists of @xmath87 isolated fully - connected clusters of size @xmath88 [ and has @xmath340 links ] , and the network is a ucm network . to prove the other direction of implication , suppose that the network is ucm with @xmath87 groups of size @xmath88 .",
    "since all components of the complement are fully connected and of size @xmath88 , the maximum laplacian eigenvalue of the complement is @xmath341 .",
    "this implies that @xmath342 .",
    "for a given @xmath2 , we first compute the function @xmath96 , which we recall is the maximum number of links possible for a network of size @xmath2 when the largest size of connected components is @xmath97 . for each @xmath88 ,",
    "the maximum number of fully - connected clusters of size @xmath88 that one can form with @xmath2 nodes is @xmath343 .",
    "forming @xmath344 such clusters requires @xmath345 links , and completely connecting the remaining @xmath346 nodes requires @xmath347 links .",
    "since any additional link would necessarily make the size of some component greater than @xmath88 , this network has the maximum possible number of links , and we thus have @xmath348 once @xmath96 is computed for the given @xmath2 and for each @xmath349 , we determine @xmath100 for a given @xmath49 as the smallest integer @xmath88 for which @xmath350 , where @xmath351 .",
    "the complement of an mcc network with @xmath2 nodes and @xmath49 links is then constructed so as to have as many fully - connected clusters of size @xmath100 as possible using all the @xmath131 available links .",
    "if one or more links remain , we recursively apply the procedure to these links and the set of remaining isolated nodes . if no cluster of size @xmath100 can be formed ( which occurs only when @xmath352 ) , we first construct a cluster of size @xmath353 , which is always possible since @xmath354 by the definition of @xmath100 .",
    "we then connect the remaining links arbitrarily while ensuring that the size of the largest connected component is @xmath100 .",
    "the resulting laplacian eigenvalues are independent of the configuration of these links , since all possible configurations are equivalent up to permutation of node indices .",
    "note that for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with arbitrary positive integers @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the procedure above results in the ucm network with the number of groups @xmath355 and the common group size @xmath356 , as it is the only mcc network in that case .",
