    "2001 ) , cluster masses and abundance ( see e.g. bahcall et al . 2002 ) and supernovae type ia ( snia ) hubble diagrams ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) indicate that the universe is currently dominated by a very weakly clustered component that is able to accelerate the expansion .",
    "this component , denoted dark energy or quintessence , is supposed to fill roughly 70% of the cosmic medium .",
    "however , the nature of the dark energy is still enigmatic ( wetterich 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ; frieman et al . 1995 ; caldwell et al .",
    "its equation of state and its interaction with dark matter are in fact so far subject only to very weak constraints ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 , huey et al . 1999 ,",
    "baccigalupi et al .",
    "2002 , corasaniti & copeland 2002 , bean & melchiorri 2002 , amendola et al .",
    "2002 ) so that there exist a large variety of different dark energy models still viable ( see for instance the review by peebles & ratra 2002 ) .",
    "perhaps the only characteristic common to almost all proposed models of dark energy is that its domination started very recently : the present epoch of acceleration was preceded by a decelerated epoch at redshift @xmath4 in which structure formed .",
    "two exceptions to this scheme are the model of dodelson et al .",
    "2000 , in which the dark energy is periodically dominating , and the generic quintessence model of lee & ng 2002 , in which the dark energy was dominating again at very large redshifts ; in both cases the expansion was however decelerated at @xmath5 of order unity .",
    "the fact that the acceleration sets in just recently in the cosmic history is one aspect of the `` coincidence problem '' that demands an explanation : see for instance the discussion based on the anthropic principle by vilenkin ( 2001 ) .",
    "another aspect of the `` coincidence problem '' is commonly phrased as why the dark energy and the dark matter densities happen to be similar just today ( zlatev et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the existence of a decelerated epoch rests on three arguments , one theoretical and two observational .",
    "the theoretical argument is based on the most common models of dark energy .",
    "in fact , a frw universe with scale factor @xmath6 filled with pressureless dark matter ( subscript @xmath7 ) and non - interacting dark energy ( subscript @xmath8 ) with a constant equation of state @xmath9 is decelerated before the epoch @xmath10^{1/(3 - 3w_{\\phi } ) } -1.\\ ] ] here and in the following the density parameters @xmath11 refer to the present quantity of the @xmath12-th component .",
    "given the current estimates @xmath13 one has @xmath14 for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "even allowing for a large curvature , e.g. @xmath16 , more than three sigma away from cmb measurements ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is not possible to go beyond @xmath17 . therefore , an hypothetical observation of a value of @xmath18 significantly larger than unity would signal that some of the assumptions leading to ( [ zacc ] ) are false .",
    "the two observational arguments are as follows .",
    "first , since gravitational instability is ineffective in an accelerated regime , it seems that an extended accelerated era is in contrast with the observed large scale structure .",
    "second , the recent supernova sn1997ff at @xmath2 is consistent with a decelerated expansion at the epoch of light emission ( benitez et al .",
    "2001 , riess et al .",
    "2002 , turner & riess 2001 ) and seems to provide `` a glimpse of the epoch of deceleration '' ( benitez et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that all three arguments are not generally true : they are in fact valid only in a restricted class of models . as a counterexample , a simple flat - space model with a constant equation of state",
    "will be explicitely constructed that can be accelerated at large @xmath1 , allows structure formation and is not in conflict with the current supernova data , including sn1997ff .",
    "such a dark energy model , based on a coupling of dark energy to dark matter ( amendola 2000 ) , makes very strong and unique predictions that can be easily tested in the near future .",
    "some of the results here reported have been already applied to a specific model of string - inspired dark energy ( amendola et al .",
    "this paper generalizes the arguments without referring to specific realizations and performs a likelihood comparison to the snia data .",
    "let us start with the last argument , i.e. the constraints imposed by the farthest type ia supernova known so far , sn1997ff ( benitez et al .",
    "the recent assessment of the lensing magnfication increased the apparent magnitude of sn1997ff by @xmath20 mag ( riess et al .",
    "the result is conveniently expressed in terms of `` milne s deviation '' , i.e. the deviation @xmath21 of the distance modulus @xmath22 from that of a milne model ( i.e. a hyperbolic empty universe , @xmath23 which has a constant expansion velocity ) . in benitez",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) and riess et al . (",
    "2002 ) it was found @xmath24 at @xmath25 , in good agreement with a best fit flat @xmath26 cosmology .",
    "as we anticipated , for such a cosmology the redshift @xmath27 is indeed already well within the decelerated epoch , which started at @xmath28 .",
    "however , this does not mean that all models which are accelerated at large @xmath1 are ruled out ( even without mentioning the still unclear experimental uncertainties of the supernova detection ) .",
    "in fact , let us calculate the luminosity distance in milne s model .",
    "the luminosity distance in a frw metric with scale factor @xmath6 is defined as@xmath29 , \\ ] ] where the function @xmath30 $ ] is @xmath31 depending on the spatial curvature @xmath32 , respectively , and where the function @xmath33 is derived from the friedmann equation written as@xmath34 for instance , in the case of a model with matter ( subscript @xmath7 ) , dark energy ( subscript @xmath8 ) with constant equation of state @xmath35 and curvature , one has@xmath36 where @xmath37 in an empty hyperbolic universe we have then @xmath38 and@xmath39 so that the luminosity distance is@xmath40 = \\frac{z^{2}+2z}{2h_{0}}.\\ ] ] it appears then that @xmath41 for large redshifts .",
    "any model with a luminosity distance that grows slower than @xmath42 yields @xmath43 ( as sn1997ff ) beyond some @xmath1 .",
    "perhaps the simplest model one can construct with such a property is a flat space with a single fluid with constant equation of state @xmath44 . in this case one",
    "has in fact@xmath45 and the luminosity distance ( for @xmath46@xmath47 .\\ ] ] for @xmath48 and large @xmath1 we have @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that , at large @xmath1 and for any @xmath50 , milne s model gives always larger distances ( and therefore fainter luminosity , i.e. larger apparent magnitudes ) than the single - fluid flat - space evolution . in fig",
    "1 i plot @xmath21 for various values of @xmath44 , along with the reference flat model @xmath26 . it appears clearly that values of @xmath44 around @xmath51 are acceptable , as it will be confirmed by the likelihood analysis below .     for two values of @xmath52 .",
    "the thick curves include a component @xmath53 of uncoupled baryons .",
    "the dashed curve is the reference model .",
    "the gray errorbars represents the high - redshift data of perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , while the black errorbars summarize all the supernova data at large @xmath54 derived from benitez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . ]",
    "however , according to the observations , our universe is composed by a mixture of , say , 30% of clustered matter ( which includes a 5% of baryons ) and 70% unclustered dark energy . therefore the single - fluid model ( [ single ] ) can account for the observations only if both components scale with the same power @xmath44 .",
    "this is exactly what happens assuming a direct interaction between dark matter and dark energy in the regime of strong coupling ( amendola 2000 , amendola & tocchini - valentini 2001 , gasperini et al .",
    "let us assume infact two fluids : one ( subscript @xmath7 ) , with equation of state @xmath55 , is later to be identified with dark matter , and the other ( subscript @xmath8 ) , with equation of state @xmath35 , to be identified with dark energy .",
    "assume then a direct interaction term @xmath56 that trasfers energy from one component to the other .",
    "the conservation equations are@xmath57 where the friedmann equation reads@xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it appears then that a solution with @xmath60 exists if ( zimdahl et al . 2001 , amendola & tocchini - valentini 2002)@xmath61 therefore , the direct interaction induces on both components an effective equation of state @xmath62 such that @xmath63 the friedmann equation becomes then @xmath64 as assumed in ( [ single ] ) .",
    "accelerated cosmological solutions with @xmath60 , denoted _ stationary _ solutions because @xmath65 , has been studied in several papers ( see e.g. amendola 1999 , chimento et al .",
    "2000 , amendola & tocchini - valentini 2001 , gasperini et al .",
    "2001 , pietroni 2002 , bonanno & reuter 2002 , gromov et al .",
    "2002 ) even before the evidences for acceleration ( carvalho et al .",
    "1992 , wetterich 1995 ) .",
    "this class of dark energy models has been invoked to explain the coincidence problem : in fact , in such models the dark matter and the dark energy scale identically with time , and as a consequence their ratio is frozen to the observed value from some time onward .",
    "it is indeed not difficult to produce accelerated expansions in which the ratio @xmath66 is of order unity at all times after equivalence ( amendola & tocchini - valentini 2001 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the contours of the likelihood function obtained analysing the snia data of perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to determine the allowed range of @xmath44 ( we consider the 38 high-@xmath1 sne plus the 16 low-@xmath1 sne of their fit c , plus the supernova at @xmath67 ) .",
    "in the upper part of the plot we show the likelihood @xmath68 for a `` standard '' flat - space model composed of two uncoupled fluid as in eq .",
    "( [ standard ] ) with @xmath69 : a fraction @xmath70 of matter with equation of state @xmath71 and a fraction @xmath72 of dark energy with constant equation of state @xmath35 .",
    "this plot reproduces the similar one in perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( see also dalal et al .",
    "2001 for a further generalization ) and has been obtained by marginalizing over the `` nuisance '' parameters @xmath73 ( the supernovae absolute magnitude ) and @xmath74 ( the slope of the stretch factor relation , see perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 for the definitions of these parameters ) . in the limit of @xmath75",
    "the luminosity distance becomes as in the stationary case ( [ dl ] ) with @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , in the lower panel we show the one - dimensional likelihood @xmath77 , corresponding to the section at @xmath78 of the upper panel .",
    "as we will show in the following , it is necessary to decouple the baryons from the dark energy , so that the simple stationary case ( [ dl ] ) has to be modified with the addition of a fraction @xmath79 of uncoupled baryons .",
    "the likelihood @xmath80 of this case is shown as a thin line . finally ,",
    "the intermediate likelihood drawn in dashed line includes also the supernova sn1997ff .",
    "the conclusion is that @xmath81 at 95% c.l .",
    "( @xmath82 at one sigma ) , with minimal variations including baryons and including sn1997ff .",
    "notice that this is a one - parameter fit to the snia , with a @xmath83d.o.f.@xmath84 for the best fit , just as good as the reference pure-@xmath85 model .",
    "naturally , the stationary solution is acceptable only if one can show that the component @xmath86 clusters while the dark energy component @xmath87 does not .",
    "this is the argument of the next section .",
    "let us now identify the dark energy component with a scalar field .",
    "it has been shown in amendola & tocchini - valentini ( 2001 ) that , assuming @xmath35 and @xmath55 constant , the only scalar field model that reduces to the equations above requires a coupling @xmath88 with @xmath89 where the second equality holds for pressureless dark matter , @xmath71 , which is the case we study below .",
    "moreover , it is easy to show that @xmath90const .",
    "implies an exponential potential @xmath91 where @xmath92\\ ] ] ( again the second equality is for @xmath71 ) .",
    "the equations for the matter ( from now on @xmath71 ) and the scalar field component are then@xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( amendola 2000 ) , the system converges toward a global attractor with a power law expansion @xmath96 , characterized by@xmath97 which is accelerated for @xmath98    the growth of perturbations in the above model has been studied in amendola & tocchini - valentini ( 2002 ) ; here we just state the results . for scales smaller than the horizon",
    "the perturbation equation for the matter density contrast @xmath99 can be written as@xmath100 where primes denote derivation with respect to @xmath101 and @xmath102 employing the trace of the einstein equations @xmath103 = -\\frac{3}{2}w_{e},\\ ] ] we find the solution @xmath104 where@xmath105 , \\ ] ] where @xmath106 .    the observational constraints @xmath107 and @xmath82 confine the parameters @xmath108 in the shadowed region in fig .",
    "3 , where we also plot @xmath109 . for instance , putting @xmath110 , as suggested by the snia , and @xmath111 we obtain a growth as fast as @xmath112 , which reduces to @xmath113 if @xmath114 .",
    "this shows that the dark matter fluctuations can grow even during the accelerated phase , due to the extra pull of the dark energy coupling .",
    "the @xmath115-th plane - wave component of the scalar field perturbation @xmath116 grows as @xmath117 where @xmath118 for subhorizon wavelengths @xmath119 ( which is proportional to @xmath120 ) remains always much smaller than @xmath99 .",
    "it is interesting that even the dark energy fluctuations grow ( as @xmath121 ) during the accelerated epoch .",
    "this demonstrates that the two components may be indeed identified with clustered matter and unclustered dark energy .",
    "naturally , we have only proved that the perturbations do grow during acceleration , not that the present level of dark matter fluctuations is compatible with observations .",
    "this requires however the knowledge of the behavior of the perturbation throughout the post - decoupling era , not only during the final accelerated stage . in detailed models such as the string - inspired one discussed in amendola et al .",
    "( 2002 ) it can be shown that it is indeed possible to match the observed level of fluctuations .",
    "as an aside , let us comments on the consequences of the above results on an application of the anthropic principle . according to vilenkin ( 2002 ) ,",
    "that generalized previous analyses by weinberg ( 1987 ) , the amount of dark energy can not exceed too much the observed value because otherwise the perturbation growth stops before galaxies can form , thereby preventing life .",
    "in particular , the anthropic principle `` predicts '' that @xmath122 has to be significanty smaller than unity , i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "however , if dark energy is coupled to dark matter , perturbations can grow even when @xmath122 is dominating .",
    "for instance , a universe with @xmath124 ( i.e. @xmath125 ) admits a growth rate @xmath126 if @xmath127 is very large ( @xmath128 in this case ) .",
    "it seems therefore that the anthropic principle is unable to constrain @xmath122 in the general case .",
    "we have shown so far that the past duration of the present acceleration is not limited by the supernovae data nor by the structure growth . but how far in the past can we extend the accelerated stationary solution ? in this section we show that the limiting factor is to be found in the present observed abundance of baryons .",
    "in fact , the coupling between matter and dark energy is a `` fifth force '' comparable in strength to gravity .",
    "this can be seen already from eq .",
    "( [ deltacsimp ] ) , in which the usual force term @xmath129 is replaced by @xmath130 . in other words , to the lowest order , the effect of the dark matter / dark energy interaction is to induce an effective gravitational constant ( damour & nordvedt 1993 ) @xmath131 as long as the dark energy interacts only with dark matter , such a fifth force is of course locally unobservable .",
    "however , if the dark energy couples to baryons with strength @xmath132 then the interaction shows up to the post - post newtonian ( ppn ) order as a non - zero parameter @xmath133 defined as in hagiwara et al .",
    "the relation between @xmath133 and @xmath132 can be found by observing that the coupled system of dark energy and matter fields @xmath134 can be derived from the lagrangian@xmath135 where the metric @xmath136 is conformally related to @xmath137 by the factor @xmath138 and where the dimensionless field @xmath139 has been introduced to match the definition of damour & esposito - farese ( 1992 ) , hagiwara et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and will ( 2002 ) .",
    "then , according to damour & esposito - farese ( 1992 ) ( see also will 2002 ) , the ppn parameter @xmath133 is defined as@xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath142 are of the order of @xmath143 ( hagiwara et al .",
    "2002 ) , so that @xmath132 is constrained to be smaller than @xmath144 roughly . for as concerns the cosmological evolution at small @xmath1 , this is equivalent to assuming @xmath145 , so that our starting assumption that the dark energy couples only ( or preferentially ) to dark matter , is justified .",
    "similar species - dependent couplings have been discussed in other contexts since the first proposal by damour , gibbons , & gundlach ( 1990 ) , see e.g. the astrophysical bounds discussed by gradwohl & frieman ( 1992 ) .",
    "however , if the baryons are uncoupled they dilute with the usual behavior @xmath146 i.e. faster than the coupled dark energy / dark matter fluid .",
    "this modifies the friedmann equation ( [ dl ] ) as follows @xmath147.\\ ] ] there appears therefore an epoch in the past before which the baryons were dominating and , as a consequence , the expansion decelerated .",
    "denoting with @xmath148 a generic uncoupled component ( in this case the baryons ) this epoch @xmath18 in flat space is @xmath149^{1/(3 - 3w_{e})}-1,\\ ] ] which therefore replaces ( [ zacc ] ) .",
    "it appears then that the factor that limits the acceleration epoch is the present abundance of baryons .",
    "assuming @xmath150 the maximum @xmath18 turns out to be around 5 as shown in fig .",
    "4 .    it is to be noticed that if @xmath127 and @xmath151 are constant at all epochs , the present accelerated epoch is preceded by a decelerated baryon - dominated epoch before @xmath18 .",
    "such an epoch would however be in conflict with the cmb , as shown in tocchini - valentini & amendola ( 2001 ) , because of an extremely large integrated sachs - wolfe effect on the cmb .",
    "it is therefore necessary to modify the simplest case with , for instance , a modulation of the coupling parameter @xmath127 or the potential @xmath152 in order to prevent the baryon domination , as in amendola & tocchini - valentini ( 2001 ) and in amendola et al .",
    ". these models also account for the observed level of present fluctuations .",
    "this paper shows that high-@xmath1 acceleration is a viable possibility if dark energy couples to dark matter .",
    "although the present abundance of baryons limit the epoch of acceleration to @xmath153 , this is still much earlier than the standard models of uncoupled dark energy , which hardly reaches @xmath154 .",
    "the future observations of snia at high redshift will be well suited to detect or reject an early acceleration .    a strong coupling between dark energy and dark matter can also be detected through the biasing and the rate of growth of perturbations , as discussed in amendola & tocchini - valentini ( 2002 ) . in principle",
    ", the coupling could be seen also in astrophysical objects like galaxy clusters by comparing the forces felt by dark matter halos and baryons ( for instance , baryons in the intracluster gas ) , i.e. as an astrophysical test of the violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "this approach , discussed in detail in gradwohl & frieman ( 1992 ) , requires several assumptions on the distribution of dark haloes .",
    "as emphasized by peebles ( 2002 ) , however , it has the potentiality to open unexplored paths in cosmology .",
