    "one puzzling mystery surrounding our neighboring spiral galaxy m31 is that while the milky way , which is comparable in mass and morphology , has 130 known high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , m31 has none",
    ". galactic high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) typically contain stars of spectral type o8b3 @xcite .",
    "these stars have @xmath0 , or @xmath1 when scaled to the distance of ( 780 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and reddening ( @xmath2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of m31 .",
    "we have performed a spectral survey of bright blue optical counterpart candidates of catalogued x - ray sources in an attempt to discover the hmxb population of m31 , and to begin measuring its characteristics .",
    "being young objects , hmxbs are associated with star formation . in m31 ,",
    "star formation is mostly associated with the disc .",
    "an investigation of the star formation rate of the disc has been conducted by @xcite , who finds that the mean sfr over the last 60 myr for 1.4 deg@xmath3 of the m31 disc is @xmath4  yr@xmath5 ( in the range 0.1 - 100 @xmath6 ) with no drastic changes .",
    "we used the calibration of @xcite to calculate the expected number of hmxbs ( see comment in @xcite , regarding the normalization ) to be @xmath72 hmxbs brighter than @xmath8 erg  s@xmath5 , and @xmath732 sources brighter than @xmath9 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , recent work on the luminosity function of hmxbs in the small magellanic cloud has resulted in a different shape than for larger galaxies @xcite . while this shape may not be relevant for the larger galaxy m31 , it is more sharply cut off at luminosities @xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath5 . scaling the smc hmxb xlf by a factor of 6 to account for the higher star formation rate in m31",
    ", we would expect @xmath740 hmxbs with a luminosity above 10@xmath11 erg  s@xmath5 , but none brighter than 10@xmath12 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the estimates are reasonable , given that the galaxy has @xmath720 hmxbs with x - ray luminosities @xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath5 @xcite , which could be detected at the distance of m31 .",
    "however , hmxbs are difficult to find at that distance , as evidenced by the fact that m33 , at similar distance and star formation rate but with lower star density and dust content , has just 3 known hmxbs @xcite , one of which has been confirmed with radial velocities @xcite .",
    "m31 has been well - observed and catalogued in the x - ray and optical @xcite , so one would expect that hmxbs would have been discovered and confirmed by now , as is the case with m33 ; however , there are several possible reasons why we have not yet found any confirmed hmxbs in m31 .",
    "the most likely is that they are more heavily crowded by other stars and more heavily reddened than in m33 .",
    "another possibility is that the relatively low star formation rate , and high metallicity ( solar  supersolar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may hamper hmxb production @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that many of the hmxbs in m31 are too faint to be detected by our currently - available surveys .",
    "while deep _ chandra _ observations of m31 are mainly limited to the central portions of the galaxy @xcite , where spectroscopic follow - up is very difficult , has surveyed the entire galaxy @xcite .",
    "epic observations taken between june 2006 and february 2008 , together with archival observations @xcite from june 2000 to july 2004 yielded a total of 1948 x - ray sources ( 0.2 - 12.0 kev ) covering ( for the first time ) the entire d25 ellipse of m 31 , down to a limiting luminosity of @xmath13 erg  s@xmath5 in the 0.2 - 4.5 kev band @xcite .",
    "these sources include ( i ) sources within m31 , i.e. x - ray binaries , supernova remnants ( snrs ) and supersoft sources , ( ii ) foreground ( galactic ) stars and ( iii ) background objects , i.e. mostly active galactic nuclei , some normal galaxies and a few clusters of galaxies .",
    "hardness ratios , x - ray variability and correlations with catalogues in other wavelengths ( optical , radio ) have been used in an attempt to classify the various x - ray sources . however , a high percentage ( 65% ) of the sources can still only be classified as @xmath14hard@xmath10 sources , i.e. it is not possible to determine whether these sources are x - ray binaries or crab - like snrs in m31 , or background x - ray sources ( mainly agns ) not associated with m31 .    here",
    ", we discuss spectroscopic results regarding the x - ray binary population revealed by these x - ray data and follow - up optical spectroscopic observations of counterpart candidates found within these data sets , including 8 bright , early - type stars that are probable hmxbs .",
    "two of these 8 have spectra with emission lines , making them good hmxb candidates .",
    "another one of these 8 has a spectrum similar to be stars , making it a strong be - hmxb candidate .",
    "many of the other spectra obtained were newly - discovered agn behind m31 which will be discussed in another paper ( green et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "section 2 describes how our counterpart candidates were selected , the data acquisition and reduction process , and the classification of the optical spectra .",
    "section 3 details our results , providing descriptions of each hmxb candidate individually , and section 4 summarizes our findings .",
    "optical counterparts of the x - ray sources were sought within the optical catalogue of m31 from the local group galaxy survey ( lggs * ? ? ? * ) , which provides stellar photometry covering the entire optical disc of m31 .",
    "the photometric accuracy is 1% down to 21st magnitude , and the positional accuracy is 0.25@xmath15 .",
    "we cross - correlated the @xcite and @xcite catalogues , using a @xmath16 ( combined x - ray and optical positional uncertainty ) search radius .",
    "typical search radii were @xmath74@xmath15 , and the local densities of bright blue stars in the @xcite catalogue within 0.1@xmath17 of our spectroscopy targets was @xmath186 arcmin@xmath19 , making the chance superposition rate @xmath188% .",
    "the optical counterparts of hmxbs are expected to be be stars or supergiants . using the v - band magnitude and colour limits for",
    "be stars from @xcite , and taking into account the distance modulus and interstellar absorption of m31 , we have estimated blue supergiants and be stars in m31 to have apparent magnitudes in the range v@xmath20 and @xmath21 , with the bright end ( v@xmath1419.5 ) being supergiants and the faint end v(@xmath1019.5 ) being be stars . among the optical counterparts of x - ray sources mentioned above , down to the limiting magnitude of 20.5 ( where the @xcite is highly complete ) , there are 91 objects within the expected colour range . however , with our available telescope and instrument ( described below ) , we were able to obtain spectra for @xmath226 objects per season . since about half of the observed sources turned out not to be stellar , our final stellar sample for this work was 20 spectra of 17 objects in the 7 season campaign .",
    "the optical data presented here were acquired with the 3.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory ( apo ) , located in the sacramento mountains in sunspot , new mexico ( usa ) .",
    "observations were carried out during fall of 2006 , 2008 and 2011 , during summer and fall of 2007 , 2009 , fall of 2011 and summer of 2012 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) , a medium dispersion spectrograph with separate collimators for the red and blue part of the spectrum and two 2048x1028 e2v ccd cameras , with the transition wavelength around 5350 . for the blue branch ,",
    "a 400 lines / mm grating was used , while the red branch was equipped with a 300 lines / mm grating .",
    "the nominal dispersions were 1.83 / pixel and 2.31 / pixel , respectively , with central wavelengths at 4500   and   7500 .",
    "the nominal wavelength coverage provided by this instrument setup around the central value was 4660  and 7620   for the two branches , respectively .",
    "however , due to vignetting towards the chip edges , the wavelength regions actually used were somewhat reduced ( blue : 3750 - 5400 , red : 5200 - 8000 ) .",
    "a 1.5  slit was employed .",
    "exposure times ranged from 900 to 2700  s , depending on the magnitude of the object , as well as on seeing and weather conditions .",
    "at least three exposures were obtained per object ; some of the targets required 4 or 5 exposures .",
    "each on - target series of exposures was followed by a comparison lamp exposure ( henear ) for wavelength calibration .",
    "spectra of two spectrophotometric flux standards ( feige110 and bd+28 - 4211 ) were acquired during the same observing runs . a series of 22 spectroscopic standards of mainly early spectral types were also observed .",
    "figure  [ locations ] shows the location of the observed sources ( red symbols ) on an optical unfiltered image of m31 obtained with the schmidt telescope on calar alto ( using hdap which was produced at landessternwarte heidelberg - knigstuhl under grant no .",

    "we have marked with cyan the locations of ob stars in m31 ( obtained using appropriate colour and magnitude cuts from the @xcite catalogue ) , which delineate the spiral arms .",
    "the vast majority of the objects were observed both in blue and red , usually with the same total exposure time .",
    "a total of 20 objects ( non - agn ) spectra have been acquired , as likely counterparts of 17 x - ray sources .",
    "16 of the spectra obtained have coverage from 3750 - 8000   , the others have only 3750 - 5200   because the red detector was not functioning from november 2006 to september 2007 .",
    "the details of the observations of stellar spectra are reported in table  [ log ] , the x - ray properties of the objects , including positional offsets , are in table  [ x - ray ] , while the lggs optical photometry data and 2mass ir photometry data for the counterparts observed are given in table  [ optical ] .",
    "the other spectra will be described in a paper detailing the agn ( j. green et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the structure of the table  [ log ] is as follows :    1 .",
    "_ column 1 _ gives the @xcite catalogue number 2 .",
    "_ column 2 _ gives the x - ray source number of the target as it appears in pfh2005 .",

    "_ column 8 _ provides the number of individual exposures acquired for the corresponding spectrum .",
    "finally , we also observed a set of early - type stars with known spectral types , given in table  [ standards ] , for use in cross - correlation tests to quantify our qualitative classifications where possible .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the _ noao - iraf _ fits image kernel ( july 2003 ) , using standard procedures : first , the frames were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "the 2-d spectra were subsequently traced and extracted using the all - in - one package _",
    "apextract_. comparison lamp spectra were then extracted from the corresponding lamp exposures , using the profiles measured for the corresponding object spectra .",
    "the comparison lamp spectra were used to provide the wavelength calibration of the object spectra .",
    "the resulting accuracy of the wavelength calibration is @xmath23(see  [ observations ] for spectral resolution ) .",
    "flux calibration was achieved using the spectrophotometric flux standard spectra .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard spectra were processed with the same tools as the object spectra .",
    "then the fluxes as a function of wavelength were compared to the published values from @xcite to produce a sensitivity map , which was then applied to all of our observed spectra .",
    "the calibrated object spectra were combined , weighting according to exposure time , to yield the final spectrum .",
    "this reduction and calibration procedure was also adopted to the spectroscopic standards .",
    "a first level of classification of the observed spectra was performed by visual inspection .",
    "the original set of spectra obtained , included several cases of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , showing characteristic , usually broad , emission lines .",
    "these will be discussed in a separate publication ( j. green et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the rest of the spectra were either stellar or nebular ( snrs or hii regions ) or a combination of the two .",
    "spectra showing a strong continuum with relatively narrow , or lack of , absorption and/or emission lines , were classified as stellar .",
    "if a spectrum showed strong h@xmath24 and [ s ii ] emission lines , it was classified as a snr or an hii region , depending on the relative strengths of these lines .",
    "blue stellar spectra were roughly classified by eye and put through the iraf cross - correlation routine fxcor against our set of spectral standards in table  [ standards ] , which returns a peak cross - correlation strength and best - fit velocity .",
    "after initial classifications into star , agn , or snr / hii region , we had 20 stellar spectra , or stellar spectra combined with diffuse emission , corresponding to 17 x - ray sources , out of spectra of counterpart candidates of 41 x - ray sources .",
    "sources [ pmh 224 ] , [ steile 235 ] , and [ pmh 367 ] each have 2 counterpart candidates for which we obtained spectroscopy .    the optical and x - ray brightness distribution of the stars , compared to the overall distribution of our sample is shown in figure  [ fluxhist ] .",
    "we then determined which of these stars were in m31 using their velocities .",
    "any star showing an emission or absorption line feature corresponding with a blue shift corresponding to the velocity of m31 was considered a m31 member .",
    "of the 20 spectra considered here , 2 are foreground objects ( lggs j004123.75 + 411459.6 , lggs j004445.06 + 415153.4 ) , 5 are unlikely to be the correct counterpart ( lggs  j003937.27 + 404928.9 , lggs  j004216.78 + 404814.4 , lggs  j004259.07 + 413731.4 , lggs  j004456.78 + 413548.0 , lggs  j004604.83 + 415142.4 ) , two are different parts of the same snr in m31 ( lggs  j004210.24 + 405149.4 , lggs  j004210.38 + 405148.1 ) .",
    "two are star clusters in m31 ( lggs j004218.72 + 411401.2 , lggs j004309.86 + 411900.9 ) the other 9 are stars in m31 .    any star in m31 with luminosities meeting our selection criteria that is a member of m31 ( v@xmath1420.5 ; m@xmath25 at the distance of m31 ) associated with an x - ray source with a hard spectrum should be considered a good hmxb candidate ; however , relatively red spectra could be low - mass stars in the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "furthermore , stellar spectra showing no atypical features ( e.g. , emission lines ) , may be chance superpositions with the x - ray source error circle .",
    "therefore , our best hmxb candidates are those that are the bluest and show atypical spectral features for single stars",
    ". there are 11 x - ray sources with a counterpart candidate spectrum of a star in m31 , 9 of these 11 have spectral types that only apply to stars with masses @xmath265  m@xmath27 ( one is a wn star , 8 are hmxb candidates ) , and 3 of these 9 have spectral features that may indicate interaction with an x - ray - emitting companion ( _ i.e. , _ emission lines ) .",
    "we discuss all of the spectra in detail below .",
    "the only optical counterpart within the positional error - circle of this x - ray source down to the lggs @xcite limiting magnitude , is the peculiar variable r066 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their object r066==r081 ) . this object is known to show repeated optical outbursts , and has been classified by rosino as either a recurrent nova in m31 , or , more likely a u gem variable ( dwarf nova from accreting white dwarf * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our galaxy .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a u gem variable classification would be consistent with the short interval between outbursts ( recurrent novae flare up more rarely ) and the very high rate of decrease in brightness following an outburst .",
    "the object is also given a u gem - variable  uncertain \" classification in the catalogue of cataclysmic variables of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* online edition updated in 2006 ) , in the general catalogue of variable stars ( as m31-v0609 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the aavso international variable star index vsx @xcite .",
    "the blue stellar spectrum we obtained for r066 ( figure  [ r066bluespec ] ) shows clear balmer line emission ( h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , h@xmath30 and h@xmath31 ) with a velocity of @xmath3270  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the red stellar spectrum ( figure  [ r066redspec ] ) is consistent with an m5/m6 dwarf in our galaxy , with prominent tio bands ( 6322 , 6569 , 6651 , 7053 , 7666 , 8206 , 8432 ) .",
    "the classification of the star as a dwarf is based on the strength of the near infrared sodium doublet ( na 8183/8195 ) , which is a sensitive gravity indicator @xcite .",
    "the 2-mass infrared colours ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) are also consistent with this classification .",
    "indeed , at quiescence , u gem variables ( dwarf novae ) are characterized by a strong balmer emission spectrum on a blue continuum , while in the infrared , in relatively long orbital period systems , the spectrum of the secondary dominates .",
    "the secondary in u - gem s is very often a mid m dwarf , as is the case here ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most bright dwarf novae at quiescence have been detected in hard x - rays ( 0.1 - 5  kev ) , while soft x - rays ( 100 - 200 ev ) have been detected in quiescence in very few systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , both optical and x - ray properties of source [ pfh2005 ] 136 are consistent with it being a dwarf nova in the galaxy .      within the 2.5-sigma error circle ( 3.65 arcsec radius ) of the x - ray position , there are 5 candidate optical counterparts in the massey catalogue .",
    "we have obtained a spectrum of the brightest and bluest counterpart , lggs_j004130.37 + 410500.9 .",
    "the others are separated by @xmath101@xmath15 , and are fainter , so that they are unlikely to have significantly affected the spectrum of lggs_j004130.37 + 410500.9 .    the x - ray source [ pfh2005 ] 146 is spatially correlated with a catalogued hii region in m31 @xcite . the object is also recorded in the radio in @xcite .",

    "the lggs object we observed is catalogued as an h@xmath24 emission line object in @xcite who have classified it as a wolf - rayet star of wnl type embedded in an hii region , on the basis of a low resolution spectrum .",
    "our spectrum of lggs_j004130.37 + 410500.9 is very similar to the spectrum of ngc604-wr12 in m33 of type wn , in @xcite .",
    "it appears to be a composite spectrum of a wr star and an hii region . in figures  [ 146_blue ] and [ 146_red ] , we label parts of the spectrum with the characteristic lines of hii regions and wr stars identified in different colours .      table  [ 146_lines ] presents a summary of the most significant nebular emission lines identified in the spectrum of the object [ pfh2005 ] 146 .",

    "there is however some evidence that reduces somewhat the confidence level of this classification .",
    "the h@xmath24 emission observed may be partly due to diffuse emission ( from an hii region , not an snr , because there is no [ sii ] visible in the spectrum ) : there is some indication of very weak diffuse h@xmath24 emission in the lggs images around the position of lggs_j003937.29 + 404925.8 .",
    "moreover the spectrum shows some weak [ nii ] 6548  emission which is consistent with nebular emission .",
    "additionally , the second candidate counterpart discussed below also shows similar emission in h@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , at least part of the h@xmath24 emission recorded maybe due to a small surrounding nebula .",
    "we have also obtained spectra for the fainter candidate optical counterpart lggs_j003937.27 + 404928.9 . the blue spectrum is dominated by noise , with no spectral features identifiable . the red spectrum ( [ 235bspec ] )",

    "as well , the object would be a good hmxb candidate .",

    "the observed brightest optical counterpart of [ pfh 2005 ] 242 is an early type ob star in m31 , with no h@xmath24 emission .",
    "the inconsistency of the x - ray hardness ratios with a hmxb render the probability that this is the correct counterpart of the x - ray source low .",

    "these types of objects can have x - ray luminosities from few @xmath103 to 10@xmath12 erg  s@xmath5 @xcite .    as the presence of a globular cluster is rather certain , with the source being definitely extended ( and not an hii region as no characteristic lines were seen ) , it is also possible that there is a bright long period variable coinciding in location with the cluster . in this case",

    "the x - ray properties of the source suggest a hard spectrum and a luminosity of @xmath121 erg  s@xmath5 .    thus , this is still a hmxb candidate , but not one of the better candidates due to the lack of emission lines , and relatively uncertain spectral classification .",
    "there is a single counterpart in the lggs catalogue for this object , lggs_j004604.83 + 415142.4 .",
    "the spectrum shows a f - g foreground star with no h@xmath24 emission .",
    "the x - ray source is classified as hard , on the basis of its hardness ratio values , therefore the star observed is not the correct counterpart . on the lggs images there are more than three faint red objects within the 3-sigma error circle , which are candidate counterparts , which however are not recorded in @xcite .",
    "there is a single counterpart candidate in the lggs catalogue within the x - ray error circle , lggs_j004557.04 + 414830.0 , with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . except for this relatively bright blue object , there appears to be another object within the error circle , visible in the near infrared image , but not recorded in the lggs catalogue .",
    "this very red object is also recorded in 2mass ( 2mass j00455703 + 4148322 ) and in the wise all - sky data release catalogue ( wise j004556.96 + 414832.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "we have obtained a spectrum for the bright blue counterpart lggs_j004557.04 + 414830.0 .",
    "the blue part of the spectrum ( see figure  [ 1716spec1 ] ) reveals a hot star with balmer line absorption , and two cii line pairs that can be identified with relative certainty , cii4738 + 4745 , cii4289 + 4293.7 , which are common features in the spectra of be stars .",
    "the balmer lines from h@xmath124 to to h@xmath125 are clearly seen in absorption at a velocity of @xmath7 - 260 km  s@xmath5 , confirming m31 membership .",
    "cross - correlation yields peaks with vor+59 97 ( b2 v ) at a velocity of @xmath41170@xmath96160 .",
    "the red part of the spectrum ( see figure  [ 1716spec2 ] ) shows the h@xmath24 line almost completely filled in with emission , resulting in a very weak line .",
    "this is a known feature of be stars . to classify the star as a be star , the h@xmath24 line should be seen in emission . in this case , the line is almost completely filled in , which indirectly indicates emission .",
    "therefore , the object is likely a be star .",
    "the hardness ratios are completely consistent with the smc bexrbs .",
    "the x - ray flux corresponds to @xmath126 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the object is a good candidate bexrb in m31 .",
    "table  [ classifications ] summarizes our classifications , on the basis of the spectral characteristics of the candidate optical counterparts . in all but two cases",
    "we have identified a source that could provide the observed x - ray emission . among these objects , there are 8 that are possible ( 5 ) or probable ( 3 ) high mass xrb in m31 .",
    "we provide their radial velocities , along with the velocity of the m31 gas disc at their projected location ( as determined from the 21  cm maps of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in table  [ velocities ] .",
    "the velocities are in general agreement with ours , which have relatively low @xmath22100 km  s@xmath5 precision .",
    "the largest outlier is [ pmh 235 ] , which is 200 km  s@xmath5 different from the local gas , but still not enough different to suggest that it is a high velocity star .",
    "it is interesting to examine the location of these objects in characteristic diagrams in the optical and in the x - rays , in comparison to the loci of confirmed hmxbs of other galaxies on the same diagrams .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] shows a diagram of apparent magnitude versus the reddening free q - parameter q@xmath127 , for all stars in the lggs - m31 catalogue with both u - b and b - v colours measured ( grey dots ) .",
    "the q parameter is used instead of the customary b - v colour , in order to compensate for the variable reddening to the individual sources of interest here . clearly , all but one of the hmxb candidates lie within the expected locus",
    ". object 620 lies outside the box , however the spectral class is consistent with an early type star , suggesting a problem with the lggs colours for this star .",
    "figure  [ hr ] shows a x - ray hardness ratio diagram , of hr4 versus hr3 ( see table  [ x - ray ] . with blue dots we mark the location of confirmed bexrbs in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , while with red dots of confirmed agns behind the smc , from @xcite . in grey",
    "we show the location of class a and class b hmxb candidates from table  [ classifications ] .",
    "generally , bexrbs and agns are relatively well separated on this diagram in the smc , although there is overlap .",
    "our candidates lie within the locus of the smc bexrbs , taking into account the observational errors , although on average they are somewhat softer that the smc objects .",
    "indeed , our only bexrb candidate ( 407 ) lies within the smc locus , and so does 1716st which is classified as a probable hmxb , but as mentioned above the absence of h@xmath24 absorption probably indicates emission that fills in the absorption line , which would make the object a very good bexrb candidate .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have observed , reduced , and classified 20 spectra of bright blue optical counterpart candidates of 17 x - ray sources in the m31 field .",
    "we have found 3 strong hmxb candidates , and 5 acceptable candidates in the field of m31 .",
    "these are likely only a fraction of the hmxbs in m31 when compared to expectations based on the star formation rate and comparisons with the galaxy .",
    "significantly more could be found with improved data sets .",
    "for example , precise source locations could be obtained by _",
    "chandra _ imaging and matched with deeper and better - resolved stellar photometry , such as that of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( * ? ? ?",
    "* williams et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .    while our candidates require very high - quality spectral follow - up on larger telescopes in order to look for radial velocity variations that would confirm their hmxb nature , the relative numbers , optical spectra , optical photometry , and x - ray properties of our best hmxb candidates suggests they should be the focus of dedicated high signal - to - noise studies at higher spectral resolution in the future .",

    "<S> we present new optical spectroscopy of 20 candidate counterparts of 17 x - ray sources in the direction of the m31 disc . by comparing the x - ray catalogue from the xmm - newton survey of m31 with star catalogues from the local group galaxy survey , we chose counterpart candidates based on optical colour and x - ray hardness . </S>",
    "<S> we have discovered 17 counterpart candidates with spectra containing stellar features . </S>",
    "<S> eight of these are early - type stars of o or b type in m31 , with hard x - ray spectra , making them good hmxb candidates . </S>",
    "<S> three of these eight exhibit emission lines , which we consider to be the strongest hmxb candidates . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our spectra reveal two likely galactic cataclysmic variables , one foreground m star , two probable lmxbs related to m31 globular clusters , one emission line region with an embedded wolf - rayet star , and one newly - discovered supernova remnant . </S>",
    "<S> finally , two of the sources have stellar spectra with no features indicative of association with an x - ray source . </S>"
