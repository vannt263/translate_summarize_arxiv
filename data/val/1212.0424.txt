    "the experimental studies on this topic have made great breakthrough .",
    "based on the berry phase effect @xcite and its non - abelian generalization @xcite , spielman s group in nist has successfully generated a synthetic external abelian or non - abelian gauge potential coupled to neutral atoms @xcite .",

    "realization of soc in quantum gases will open a whole new avenue in cold atom physics .",
    "motivated by these recent experimental progresses of ultracold fermi gases , we consider the two dimensional ( 2d ) fermi gas with soc in the repulsive regime .",

    "the repulsive fermi gas is stable when it is far away from the resonant regime , which has been successfully reached in experiment @xcite . in our previous work ,",
    "we have studied low energy single particle excitations and calculated the fermi liquid parameters such as the quasi - particle lifetime , renormalization factor and the effective mass in the repulsive regime @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the collective modes of two dimensional fermi gas with soc in the repulsive regime .",
    "the research of the low energy collective modes in degenerated quantum gases yields a wealth of insights into the properties of ultracold atomic systems .",

    "soc fermi gas has strongly correlated spin and density excitations . within the scheme of random phase approximation ( rpa ) ,",
    "we classify all the collective modes and determine their properties via the poles of corresponding rpa correlation functions .",
    "in contrast with previous works in solid state systems @xcite , the consideration of @xmath0-wave interaction in ultracold atomic systems instead of the coulomb interaction leads to qualitatively different collective behaviors .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold : first , the force range of the @xmath0-wave interaction is short and the interaction vertex is independent to the momentum transfer .",
    "second , the @xmath0-wave interaction is spin - dependent in ultracold fermi gas , which can be decomposed into the density and spin channels @xcite .",
    "the collective modes of this system are grouped into two categories : ( i ) one branch of gapless mode , namely zero sound , which is an oscillation of density coupled with the transverse spin oscillation ; ( ii ) three branches of gapped modes .",

    "there are two categories of collective modes in this system .",
    "one branch has a gapless dispersion , known as the zero sound . in presence of soc , the density oscillation",
    "is intrinsically coupled with the transverse spin oscillation for this mode .",

    "we calculated the sound speed of the gapless mode and the energy gaps of the gapped modes , and also estimated their values for typical experimental parameters .",
    "in contrast to the coulomb interaction in 2d solid state systems , the @xmath0-wave interaction leads to fundamentally different phenomena , such as the presence of linear dispersion of the zero sound and the gapped modes .",
