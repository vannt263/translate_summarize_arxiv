    "in this paper we present a high resolution simulation of a radio jet interacting with an inhomogeneous interstellar medium in the form of a turbulently supported disk which extends our previous work in several different directions : ( 1 ) the simulation is three dimensional with a resolution of 512 cells in the ( cartesian ) coordinate directions and a spatial scale of 2 parsecs per cell .",
    "( 2 ) the density structure of the warm disk is described by a log - normal distribution , typical of the warm interstellar medium in a number of different environments .",
    "( 3 ) the initial distribution of the warm medium is that of a thick almost keplerian disk supported by a combination of thermal pressure and a , dominant , supersonic velocity dispersion .",
    "this type of distribution is one of several that may be contemplated and is supported by the observation of such disks in m87 @xcite and ngc  7052 @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the soft x - ray emissivity and surface brightness of the thermal plasma is calculated , in conjunction with the radio surface brightness image .",
    "these synthetic images provide valuable insights for the interpretation of observational data .",
    "this simulation illustrates four important phases in the evolution of a young radio galaxy : ( 1 ) an initial  flood and channel \" phase wherein the radio source is beginning to be established , but is still interacting strongly with the disk material .",
    "( 2 ) a quasi - spherical jet - driven bubble phase where the jet is fully disrupted .",
    "( 3 ) a rapid jet establishment phase where the last obstruction is ablated away and the jet reforms and crosses the spherical bubble . ( 4 ) a classical jet  cocoon  bow - shock phase familiar from previous studies of radio sources in a single component , hot ism .",
    "we also determine the x - ray morphology associated with the interaction of the radio source with the disk and show that the luminosity from the disk may persist well after the initial flood and channel phase .",
    "elliptical galaxies contain both baryonic and dark matter .",
    "the former dominates on scales close to the core and the latter dominates at radii @xmath0 .",
    "since jet simulations frequently extend over such scales , we have constructed a family of potentials which we use to represent a combined , self - consistent distribution of baryonic and dark matter . in the simulation presented here ,",
    "the scale of the simulation is such that the potential is dominated by the luminous component close to the core .",
    "the potential is based on isothermal distributions of baryonic and dark matter , described in terms of isotropic distribution functions .",

    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) although perhaps not all ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the well known navarro , frenk & white , ( nfw ) , @xcite , profile arises in an empirical manner from smooth particle cosmological simulations , whereas the isothermal formalism arises from simple physical considerations @xcite . in the absence of a definitive proof either way , we choose to follow the isothermal path .",
    "we note that with a coupled baryonic / dark matter potential , the region between the baryonic core radius ( 350  pc ) and the outer dark matter core radius ( 3.5  kpc ) does produce intermediate density radial power ",
    "law indices in the range ; @xmath12 , before turning down to steeper slopes beyond the dark matter core radius ( well outside our present simulation ) .",
    "if a galaxy with such a double potential were observed with insufficient resolution to resolve the inner 300  pc , then the observed distribution inside the dark matter core radius would be observed to be steeper than a single isothermal distribution , perhaps being consistent with a more ` cuspy ' nfw distribution .",

    "the latter avoids the difficulty of prescribing an unphysically large temperature in order to achieve a reasonable disk scale height .",
    "in summary we use the double isothermal potential @xmath36with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , scaled by @xmath37  kpc , and @xmath38  km / s , and a rotation parameter @xmath39 , plus a velocity dispersion of the warm gas of @xmath40  km / s for the disk .",

    "+ if there is such a critical density @xmath105 , then we expect that in the denser model  * b * the mass _ fraction _ compressed into dense clumps would be higher since @xmath105 is determined by the jet ram pressure and the cooling function , and the corresponding fraction above a fixed point in the denser model is greater . in region 1 in model  * a * , about 60% of the original mass remains at late times , and in model  * b * at a similar late dynamical time ( estimated by the extent of the main jet - bubble ) , 72% remains .",
    "this suggests that as long as the material above a radiative critical density remains in dense , un - connected , clumps , the non - gaussian log - normal statistics of the density may influence the behavior of the global system .",
    "* inefficient transport of disk ism to outer hot atmosphere * in all cases , about 8385% of the gas starts in zones 1 and 2 combined , and 7578% remains in the two zones at the end of the simulation , with only about 47% of the disk gas being transported to the higher regions 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "only trace amounts of disk material are transported to region  6 and this is largely in the form of material diffused into the very hot radio plasma .",
    "this fraction is uncertain since it may be dominated by numerical diffusion rather than physical transport .",
    "despite the fact that the main blastwave crosses the entire disk , and locally _ many _",
    "shock crossing timescales pass , the majority of the warm clumpy disk ism is not moved out of the plane of the disk , and the jet outburst is inefficient at ` clearing out ' the disk .",
    "* transport of disk ism within the disk * in the uniform model  * c * , 75% of the disk mass initially in region 1 is swept to region 2 , and as the circular empty region increases we expect that essentially all of the inner disk would be swept clear in another @xmath107  kyr . in models",
    "* a * and * b * only 3040% of the disk in region  1 is transported to region  2 , and the timescale for clearing out region  1 is becoming greater than 150,000 years ( assuming constancy of the final mass loss rates ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that dense material will remain in region  1 for a longer time in models * a * and * b * compared to model * c*.    the clumpy nature of the models * a * and * b * significantly extend the lifetime of material in the inner zones of the outbursts , showing that in the cirumnuclear region of an active galactic nucleus , the inhomogenity of gas in the inner region makes it possible to retain gas there , maintaining a supply of accreting gas to the black hole for longer than models with homogeneous gas distributions may suggest .",
    "the relevant timescale for the duration of the outburst is determined primarily by the accretion timescale .",
    "the main simulation that we have presented , of a jet interacting with a turbulently supported disk , exhibits four interesting phases : 1 ) a ` flood and channel ' phase 2 ) a nearly adiabatic ( globally ) energy driven bubble phase 3 ) a jet breakout phase 4 ) a classical phase .",
    "these are described in detail in   [ s : slice_plots ] .",
    "the late - time morphology of the radio source manifests a clear signature of the two earlier phases .",
    "the x - ray emission also presents some further insights . not only do we see x - ray emission from the disk associated with radiative shocks in the early stages and x - ray emission associated with the bow - shock of the radio lobes but we also see persistent x - ray emission from the disk well after the radio bubble has passed through the disk .",
    "this is caused by the continued driving of radiative shocks into the disk by the high pressured bubble .",
    "the peak in the x - ray luminosity occurs during the jet breakout phase , when more of the jet energy flux is diverted into the growing , hot adiabatic bubble and there is less available for processing in the dense disk material .",
    "the behaviour of the disk is suggestive of a critical phenomenon : the critical cloud density at which the ram pressure of the jet is converted into fully radiative shocks , and the mass fraction that is available for rapid mass advection may be influenced by the log  normal density field in the disk .",
    "additionally , the global movement of disk material throughout the simulation is clearly very different for a uniform disk model compared otherwise similar , albeit somewhat ad hoc , non - uniform models ."
