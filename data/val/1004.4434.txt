    "partial separation of the dna double helix is fundamental in many processes relevant for biological functioning such as transcription and replication of the genetic information @xcite .",
    "also the packing of long dna strands into nucleosomes seems related to the local opening of a double helix segment which may provide the key mechanism for loop formation @xcite .",
    "gene transcription is possible as the hydrogen bonds , linking the pair bases on the two complementary strands , can break and expose the bases for chemical reaction .",
    "the region of open base pairs ( _ bps _ ) , the transcription bubble , is generally localized and characterized by large amplitude fluctuations known as the _ breathing _ of dna .",
    "these observations have suggested that the _ bps _ hydrogen bonds are intrinsically nonlinear @xcite thus putting some constraints on the modeling of the double helix dynamics and strands separation , the dna denaturation . the latter is driven experimentally either by increasing the temperature or reducing the proton concentration in the solvent so that the repulsion between negative phosphate groups on the two strands is less screened .",
    "also adsorption of dna on a surface affects the denaturation properties , a process widely used in biotechnologies @xcite .",
    "thermally induced bubbles can be several _ bps _ long even at about room temperature and extend by increasing @xmath0 , leading to the dna melting once the complete strand separation occurs .",
    "such process is made evident by a sharp increase in the uv absorbance @xcite of the dna solution due to the reduction of both base pairing and stacking ( along the strand ) upon denaturation .",
    "in fact substantial differences occur in the uv absorption profiles for synthetical _ homogeneous _ and natural _ heterogeneous _ dna : while the former denaturates within a narrow temperature range , the latter shows multiple steps transitions @xcite according to patterns which depend both on the length and on the sequence @xcite , that is on fraction and specific order of the strongly bonded _",
    "guanine - cytosine _ and weakly bonded _",
    "adenine - thymine _ base pairs .",
    "however , as a common signature to all different dna structures , denaturation is a highly cooperative phenomenon involving a sizeable number of _ bps_.",
    "this follows from the fact that the thermal disruption of a specific inter - strand hydrogen bond decreases the overlap between @xmath1 electron orbitals of the organic rings in the bases and favors the unstacking of intra - strand adjacent bases which , in turn , breaks the next hydrogen bond and ultimately opens a bubble in the double helix @xcite .",
    "the role of cooperativity effects in dna has been recognized since long @xcite and introduced phenomenologically in ising - like two state models in which the _ bps _ are either closed or open .",
    "such models have been applied to represent melting transitions occuring step by step in heterogeneous dna fragments @xcite . later on hamiltonian models , in which the potential energy is continuous function of the distance between the bases @xcite , have proposed a microscopic origin for cooperativity by relating it to the anharmonic character of the intra - strand stacking potential @xcite .",
    "the latter has been found responsible for a denaturation with an entropy jump corresponding to an effective latent heat reminiscent of a first order phase transition in homogeneous dna @xcite .",
    "however , no consensus has been reached so far regarding the nature of the transition , whether first or second order @xcite .",
    "the peyrard - bishop - dauxois ( pbd ) anharmonic model @xcite has also proved to be consistent with a multistep melting envisaged by experiments in heterogeneous dna @xcite and with the formation of temporary , sequence dependent openings observed by s1 nuclease cleavage experiments @xcite . instead",
    ", some discrepancies have been pointed out between the pbd predictions and the denaturation curves of specific heterogeneous sequences @xcite indicating that improvements in the theoretical modeling are still necessary . due to the huge number of degrees of freedom , fully atomistic representations for sizeable segments of dna",
    "require prohibitive computational time .",
    "accordingly , several mesoscopic models have been developed to account for the essential interactions which determine structural stability , dynamics and denaturation of the molecule @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite , the imaginary time path",
    "integral formalism has been applied to the pbd hamiltonian to investigate the occurrence of thermal denaturation in homogeneous dna .",
    "the transverse stretchings of the _ bps _ with respect to the ground state have been treated as one - dimensional paths @xmath2 depending on the imaginary time @xmath3 whose range is set by the inverse temperature @xcite .",
    "a path is defined by a set of fourier coefficients and a single base pair displacement is taken at a specific @xmath4 . then , an ensemble @xmath5 @xmath6 represents a configuration for the dna molecule made of n _ bps _ and , by varying the fourier coefficients , one builds all the possible molecule states at a selected temperature .",
    "while _ in principle _ the path integral is obtained by summing over all dna configurations , the model potential poses lower and upper bounds on the specific bps elongations which naturally restrict the path phase space for the computation of the partition function .",
    "the method accounts for the highly cooperative character of the denaturation which appears as a smooth second order transition in homopolymer dna .    in this paper",
    "the path integral formalism @xcite is extended to heterogeneous dna and , in particular , to short fragments which are _ both _ technologically interesting for fabrication of dna chips @xcite _ and _ theoretically relevant due to the enhanced role of fluctuations far from the thermodynamic limit ( finite and small @xmath7 ) @xcite . due to the direct integration over the _ bps _",
    "degrees of freedom , the path integral method naturally incorporates fluctuation effects and seems therefore particularly promising in dealing with finite size dna fragments .",
    "the pbd hamiltonian and the generalities of the path integral approach are presented in section ii .",
    "the thermodynamical properties for some specific dna sequences are discussed in section iii together with the computation of the fractions of open _ bps _ versus temperature .",
    "some final remarks are made in section iv .",
    "the pbd hamiltonian , originally introduced for homogeneous dna @xcite , is usually extended to represent a chain of n heterogeneous _ bps _ as follows    @xmath8 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & v_s(y_n , y_{n-1})=\\ , { k \\over 2 } g(y_n , y_{n-1})(y_n - y_{n-1})^2 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & g(y_n , y_{n-1})=\\,1 + \\rho \\exp\\bigl[-\\alpha(y_n + y_{n-1})\\bigr]\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & v_m(y_n ) = \\ , d_n \\bigl(\\exp(-a_n y_n ) - 1 \\bigr)^2 \\ , , \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the transverse stretching at the _ n - th _ site and measures the relative pair mates separation from the ground state position .",
    "the model is essentially one - dimensional as the longitudinal displacements , being much smaller than the transverse stretchings , are not taken into account @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath10 closes the chain into a loop whereas , in the case of an open end chain with @xmath11 _ bps _ , the single particle energy for @xmath12 should be added to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 is the reduced mass of the bases which is assumed identical both for gc and at _ bps_. this is a relevant limitation of the model @xcite which is mirrored also in the stacking potential @xmath14 whose parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent of the type of bases at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath26 and the effective stacking coupling ( along each strand ) between neighboring bases drops to @xmath15 . then , also the adjacent base tends to open as both bases are less closely packed along their respective strands .",
    "this is the microscopic origin of the cooperative character ( emphasized in the introduction ) of the interactions which determine the formation of a region with open _",
    "bps_. the interplay between anharmonicity and cooperativity is thus at the heart of the pbd model through the form of the stacking potential .    however",
    "the form for @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is not unique and other potentials have been proposed which also account for the finiteness of the stacking energy at large intra - strand base separations @xcite .",
    "typical values for dna models with intermediate anharmonicity are taken hereafter , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "as the parameters are site independent , it follows that the present discussion is neglecting stacking hetereogeneities @xcite .",
    "the latter may slightly affect the melting temperatures of specific portions of the chain @xcite although they are not expected to modify the nature of the denaturation crossover .",
    "the quantitative effects of the stacking hetereogeneities are left for next investigations .",
    "instead , heterogeneity is present in the morse potential @xmath30 which models the hydrogen bond link between bases on complementary strands @xcite .",

    "@xmath32 sets the spatial cutoff beyond which the _ bps _ tend to open .",

    "the repulsion of the negatively charged phosphate groups is described by the hard core that the base pair mates experience by coming too close to each other ( @xmath42 ) . on the opposite side ,",
    "when the relative separation grows above a given _ threshold _ , the pair opens and the force between the mates vanishes consistently with the plateau at the dissociation energy encountered for large @xmath9 .",
    "however precisely the plateau , at about @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , reveals a drawback of the model : when all _ bps _ in the chain open , the two strands separation can grow in principle to infinite with no further effort as the potential energy is flat @xcite .",
    "thus , the pbd hamiltonian assumes a single chain in a infinite solution whereas experiments deal with dna in a solvent structure at finite concentration hence , recombination of separated strands in solution is possible .",
    "here is a case of biomolecule whose structure depends on the strong interaction with the environment , a challenge to theoretical investigation @xcite . specifically , reconciling model to experiment requires some restrictions of the configuration space which have been attempted either by methods based on molecular dynamics @xcite and monte - carlo simulations @xcite or by truncating the kernel domain in the transfer integral method @xcite to prevent the two strands from going infinitely apart @xcite . in the path integral formalism ,",
    "proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and briefly outlined in the next subsection , the confinement of the phase space for the @xmath44 is naturally incorporated in the computation after imposing a macroscopic constraint to the evolution of the system which is driven by the temperature .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the lower bound confinement for the @xmath44 , physically due to the hard core potential , ensures that the _ bps _ paths are self - avoiding at complementary sites along the strands .",
    "in fact base pair mates do not overlap .",
    "however we recognize that the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , lacking of the rotational degrees of freedom , does not capture the helicoidal structure of the molecule which should be realistically embedded in the three dimensional space .",
    "accordingly , also self - avoidance is only partially considered in our investigation as excluded volume effects due to interactions between bubbles and bounded segments in three dimensions are not taken into account .",
    "this effect has been shown to be relevant in polymer network theories to drive a sharp denaturation transition at least in homogeneous dna @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the path integral approach to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) accounts for all _ bps _ fluctuations at any @xmath0 and permits to include in the computation the two competing tendencies of the system : the energetic gain associated to the ( bounded ) double strands configuration and the entropic gain due to the large number of configurations available for open strands .",
    "the idea underlying the path integral method is that of mapping the real space model in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) onto the imaginary time scale .",
    "accordingly , the transverse stretching @xmath9 is represented by a one dimensional path @xmath45 with @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 being the inverse temperature :    @xmath48    thus , at any given temperature , the finite size system of @xmath49 _ bps _ , is described by @xmath50 @xmath51 paths each of them taken at a specific @xmath4 along the time axis . along",

    "i am assuming periodic boundary conditions , @xmath54 , for all paths analogously to those imposed for the 1d finite chain described by eq .",

    "as such coefficients can be varied in the phase space , many different configurations are possible at the same temperature each of them being a copy of the molecule in the ensemble .",

    "the temperature driven strands separation in heterogeneous dna sequences has been studied by applying the path integral formalism to the nonlinear peyrard - bishop - dauxois hamiltonian model .",
    "essentially the method consists in mapping the relative base pairs elongations onto the imaginary time scale set by the temperature .",
    "a time index @xmath4 labels each base pair which is thus described by all those paths , computed at @xmath4 in the path configuration space , which are compatible with the model potential and fulfill the macroscopic constraint given by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the computational method requires that the entropy has to grow versus temperature but no _ ansatz _ has been made regarding the shape of the entropy curves .",
    "the continuity found in the latter is consistent with the view that the strand separation is an overall smooth crossover similar in this respect to the case of homogeneous dna .",
    "the model has been applied to short fragments for which chain fluctuation effects are generally expected to broaden the transition region @xcite .",
    "in fact the molecule denaturation appears here as a multistep phenomenon , promoted by the at - rich regions , whose long range effects may gradually extend over the whole fragment .",
    "the denaturation steps are signaled by a few significant enhancements in the number of paths which participate to the partition function although such enhancements are much less sharp than those previously found in homogeneous dna .",
    "these findings are consistent with the fact that cooperativity is higher in homopolymers than in heteropolymers as , in the latter , different portions of the chain denaturate at different temperatures .",
    "the specific heat shows sharp peaks at about the same temperatures for which anomalies in the path numbers plots occur . beside a main transition peak at @xmath113 ,",
    "our dna sequences display some shoulder peaks whose frequency grows with a larger at base pairs content .",
    "however some arbitrariness remains in the definition of the _ threshold _ for the occurrence of the overall molecule denaturation and much theoretical work remains to be done to unravel this issue .",
    "the present conclusions regarding the smoothness of the denaturation are at variance with previous studies of the pbd hamiltonian @xcite suggesting that denaturation is a first order thermodynamic transition microscopically driven by the backbone stiffness parameter both in homogeneous and heterogeneous sequences @xcite .",
    "in fact the latter studies considered somewhat longer fragments than those i have taken but this should not be the source of the discrepancy regarding the character of the transition as the smooth crossover persists also by increasing the system size . also some polymer network analysis based on the poland - scheraga model for dna @xcite point to a sharp denaturation which should be ascribed however to self - avoidance effects for the three dimensional molecule rather than to backbone stiffness . while the debate is open both inside the _ pbd hamiltonian_- and the _ poland - scheraga model_- research fields , the path integral results here presented",
    "show that anharmonic stiffness alone should not change the character of the transition in heterogeneous dna .",
    "some improvements in modeling heterogeneous specific sequences are certainly expected by taking stiffness parameters which appropriately account for the stacking interactions along the molecule backbones .",
    "this feature however is not expected to modify the nature of the crossover predicted by the path integral method .",
    "instead , i feel that a main reason of divergence with respect to previous hamiltonian studies lies in the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq:3b ] ) incorporates all the path fluctuations around the ground state of the double strand structure .",
    "these fluctuations , included in the computational method , soften the effect of the entropic barrier associated to the stiffness and ultimately smoothen the crossover between the double strand configuration and a state with open domains .    further , among the mesoscopic models capturing the essentials of the complex dna interactions , the path integral method has the advantage to account for a remarkable number of molecule configurations in a short computational time .",
    "nonetheless some limitations regarding both model and method should be here recognized with the purpose to be lifted in next investigations .",
    "first , the path integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3b ] ) describes a one dimensional system : extensions to higher dimensionality may permit to fully include self - avoiding paths in the computation .",
    "second , the space - time mapping technique in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) may be modified by removing the correspondence between _ one _ base pair and _ one _ point @xmath4 along the imaginary time axis . by freeing the time from such constraint",
    ", each base pair stretching would maintain the full time dependence and _ one _ point in the path configuration space would correspond to _",
    "one _ molecule whose different configurations could then be obtained by tuning the time . accordingly the configuration space spanned by the computation would describe an ensemble of molecules each of them existing in an ensemble of different states . in this way the length of the molecules in the ensemble would become a free parameter thus allowing us to examine the denaturation process both for long dna chains and fragments with only a few tens of base pairs .",
    "analysis of long sequences may permit to check the role of the path fluctuations approaching the thermodynamic limit .",
    "on the other hand , short fragments are particularly interesting also in view of the fact that experiments capable to detect intermediate states in the melting transition are becoming available .",
