    "the vortices in a type - ii superconductor are generally pinned down by pinning centers.@xcite but there is a probability for a vortex to spontaneously hop between the adjacent pinning centers due to the vortex s thermal fluctuation.@xcite the hopping motion can be described by the arrhenius equation , which shows that the hopping frequency is strongly related to the vortex s activation energy.@xcite the hopping motion causes the magnetic flux ( or current ) in the superconductor to reduce with increasing time , which is usually referred as flux relaxation .",
    "this phenomenon exhibits various time evolution behaviors because of the complicated field ( or current ) dependence of the vortex activation energy.@xcite due to its dissipation , the hopping motion determines the superconductor s current carrying ability and consequently its application fields.@xcite thus , a large number of experimental and theoretical research works @xcite have been carried out to study the vortex hopping motion .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to study the mutual vortex hopping motion between the contacting pinning regions with different pinning ability , which we shall call _ flux exchange_. more specifically , a real superconductor may be divided into smaller regions whose sizes are larger than the superconductor s penetration depth . because of the different pinning ability of the smaller regions,@xcite the vortices close to the interface between two contacting pinning regions will hop from one region into another region @xcite , and vice versa .",
    "in other words , the two contacting pinning regions exchange vortices ( flux ) .",
    "because of the different pinning ability , the vortex hopping motions in each smaller region need to be described by different equations .",
    "this indicates that a flux exchange process is determined by the parameters of both contacting pinning regions .",
    "it can not be simply described by the conventional flux relaxation theory .",
    "thus , we need to consider the _ flux exchange _ seriously and construct new mathematical equations to describe it .",
    "however , the flux exchange is usually ignored in the magnetization ( or internal field ) measurements carried out over an entire sample.@xcite to study the flux exchange phenomenon , we may consider the fact that the vortices in a weak pinning region have a higher energy and higher hopping frequency , but the vortices in a strong pinning region have a lower energy and lower hopping frequency .",
    "consequently , there should be more vortices hop from the weak pinning region into the strong pinning region in a unit time interval .",
    "this will result in a nonzero vortex migration from the weak pinning region to the strong pinning region , which changes the vortices quantity in each pinning region .",
    "thus , it is possible to study the flux exchange phenomenon by investigating its influences on the flux quantity in each pinning region .    in this work , the physical principle of the flux exchange phenomenon",
    "was analyzed using the concepts of `` average internal fields '' .",
    "first , we constructed a system of differential equations to describe the flux exchange phenomenon by investigating its influence on the flux quantity in each pinning region .",
    "next , we calculated the approximate numerical solutions and approximate analytical solutions of the system to view the time evolution behavior of the flux exchange .",
    "finally , we discussed the flux exchange between the bulk pinning region and surface pinning region , the space outside the superconductor , respectively .",
    "as mentioned before , the flux exchange in this work means the mutual vortex hopping motion between the contacting pinning regions .",
    "this motion occurs in a thin layer close to the interfaces between the contacting pinning regions .",
    "it indicates that one can study the flux exchange by watching the pinning regions edge and counting how many vortices hopped into and hopped out of the pinning region . on the other hand",
    ", a vortex must first go to a pinning region s edge and then can hop out from this pinning region .",
    "thus , one can also obtain the information about the vortex motion in the pinning region s center by studying the flux exchange at the pinning region s edge .",
    "let us now consider an inhomogeneous superconductor which includes many small regions with different pinning ability ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the materials in each small region are uniform . below its critical temperature @xmath0",
    ", each pinning region has a maximum internal field @xmath1 ( or melting field @xmath2 ) due to its limited pinning ability . above @xmath1 ,",
    "the vortices can not be pinned down and exhibit fluidity .",
    "below @xmath1 , the vortices are pinned down and can only move through thermal fluctuation by hopping between adjacent pinning centers with a probability.@xcite    [ figure1 ]    -th pinning region and @xmath3-th pinning region of a type - ii superconductor .",

    ", scaledwidth=25.0% ]    we shall focus on the vortex hopping motion ( below @xmath1 ) in this section , but discuss the vortex flowing motion ( above @xmath1 ) at the end of this paper",
    ". the vortex hopping motion can be described by the arrhenius equation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is hopping frequency , @xmath10 is attempt frequency , @xmath11 is vortex activation energy , @xmath12 is boltzmann constant , and @xmath13 is temperature .",
    "multiplying @xmath9 by an average hopping distance @xmath14 , we obtain the vortex velocity @xcite @xmath15    let @xmath16 be the maximum internal field of the @xmath17-th pinning region . apply a uniform field , @xmath18 , to the superconductor at room temperature and then cool the superconductor down to a temperature @xmath13 below its transition temperature @xmath0 . a uniform starting field",
    "is then realized in the sample .",
    "when the applied magnetic field is turned off , the vortices in various pinning regions are then in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "this is because the vortex migration rate depends on @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is vortex velocity and @xmath21 is vortex density .",
    "eq.([vv ] ) shows that @xmath20 varies in different pinning regions , which means that a uniform vortex density can not maintain an equilibrium state between different pinning regions .",
    "thus , the vortices start to migrate from a weak pinning region to a strong pinning region . as the vortices migration goes on",
    ", a vortex gradient could be formed over the interface . according to maxwell s equation , a persistent",
    "current may flow around the pinning regions edge to maintain the vortex density gradient .",
    "any current in a superconductor exerts a lorentz force on the vortices , such as the persistent current circulating in a ring shape superconductor ( or a cylindrical superconductor ) for maintaining the flux trapped in the superconductor s hole , or the injected current flowing in a superconducting wire .",
    "the lorentz force can reduce the vortex activation energy @xmath11 and increase the vortex hopping rate .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is usually expressed as a decreasing function of the current density @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23.@xcite on the other hand , each current has a corresponding magnetic field according to the biot - savart law .",
    "the lorentz force on a vortex is then equivalent to the expelling force from other vortices .",
    "in addition to the vortices generated by the currents , there are also some trapped vortices in the superconductor ( say , a uniformly distributed field ) that is unrelated to any bulk currents .",
    "thus , @xmath11 can also be expressed as a decreasing function of the internal field @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath24.@xcite we shall use this field dependent expression in the following discussions .",
    "one can have a clearer picture of this problem by referring to the magnetic phase diagram ( @xmath25 diagram).@xcite in this diagram , all the physical properties and dynamical behavior ( relaxation , phase transition ) of a vortex system are represented by two parameters , the field @xmath26 and temperature @xmath13 .    to avoid mathematical complexity and focus on physical analysis",
    ", we shall use the concept `` average internal field '' @xcite in each pinning region although there may be a flux distribution in the pinning region .",
    "this is possible because the vortex hopping motion can be considered globally and therefore the local vortex density distribution can be ignored.@xcite let us now define the average internal field in the @xmath17-th pinning region as , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the area of the surface perpendicular to the magnetic field and @xmath29 is the magnetic flux in this region . with definition eq.([fieldb ] ) , we shall further apply a cut off to the vortex activation energies on the interface where the flux exchange occurs .      to describe the flux exchange phenomenon with mathematical language , we need to construct a system of differential equations .",
    "this can be achieved by considering the rate of change of the magnetic flux in each pinning region , which is proportional to vortex hopping frequency @xcite , or vortex velocity ( see eq.([vv ] ) ) . to this end",
    ", we shall first consider a flux exchange process that only involves two pinning regions : the @xmath5-th pinning regions and @xmath3-th pinning regions ( whose sizes are larger than the superconductor s penetration depth , see figure",
    "later , we shall generalize it into a flux exchange process that involves @xmath30 different pinning regions ( see system ( [ sde ] ) ) .    in the @xmath5-th pinning region ,",
    "the magnetic flux variation in a time interval @xmath31 includes two parts : ( a ) due to flux exchange , the vortices ( close to the interface ) in the @xmath5-th pinning region hop into the @xmath3-th pinning region @xcite by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the average internal field ( vortex density ) in the @xmath5-th pinning region , @xmath7 is the line length on the interface perpendicular to field , @xmath34 is the vortex velocity in the @xmath5-th pinning region ( see eq.([vv ] ) ) .",

    "however , the vortices in a type - ii superconductor are the quanta of magnetic field , their motions must obey maxwell s equations @xcite , or continuity equation @xcite .",
    "thus , one may ask whether the system of flux exchange is equivalent to maxwell s equations ( or continuity equation ) ?",
    "the early works @xcite have shown that , using maxwell s equations ( or continuity equation ) , the vortex motion is governed by the following equation @xmath174 where @xmath21 is internal field ( vortex density ) and @xmath20 is vortex velocity ( see eq.([vv ] ) ) .",
    "thus , our task is to prove that eq.([epq0 ] ) , eq.([eqp0 ] ) are equivalent to eq.([maxwell ] ) .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the vortex hopping motions in the smaller regions are described by different equations .",
    "it indicates that the right side of eq.([maxwell ] ) can not be directly used to describe the flux exchange between two contacting pinning regions . to solve this problem",
    ", we may refer to the definition of one - sided derivatives in mathematics .",
    "let us now consider the left derivative of @xmath175 , that is , @xmath176    let @xmath177 be a point in the @xmath5-th pinning region and @xmath178 be a point in the @xmath3-th pinning region .",
    "therefore , eq.([maxwell ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath179 where @xmath180 is an unknown constant .    using eq.([vv ] )",
    ", one can see that eq.([epq0 ] ) and eq.([exch ] ) are the same equation by putting @xmath181 .",
    "this shows that eq.([epq0 ] ) is equivalent to maxwell s equation eq.([maxwell ] ) .",
    "similarly , one can also prove that eq.([eqp0 ] ) is equivalent to eq.([maxwell ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the flux exchange equations ( system eq.([epq0 ] ) , eq.([eqp0 ] ) ) is equivalent to maxwell s equation eq.([maxwell ] ) .",
    "if we let the pinning region s size reduce to @xmath182 , then the discrete system eq.([epq0 ] ) , eq.([eqp0 ] ) reduces to the continuous equation eq.([maxwell ] ) . in this sense",
    ", one can even used the idea of `` flux exchange '' to analysis the vortex motion at a point . more specifically , to study the vortex motion at the point , one can choose a small region that includes the point , and then consider the quantity of the vortices hopped into and hopped out from the small region .",
    "this indicates that any flux creep process ( or flux relaxation process ) can be regarded as a flux exchange process .",
    "therefore , the concept of `` flux exchange '' is not just an idle variant of `` flux creep '' .",
    "the former is more general and has richer physics than the later .    from above discussion",
    ", we see that the necessary and sufficient condition for a nonzero flux exchange between two contacting pinning regions is @xmath183 ( see eq.([bpq ] ) ) . in the continuous form ,",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for a nontrivial flux creep process is @xmath184 .",
    "this disproves the necessary and sufficient condition , @xmath185 ( or @xmath21 has a nonzero gradient ) , assumed in some early literatures .",
    "eq.([epq0 ] ) , eq.([eqp0 ] ) shows that two contacting pinning regions exchange magnetic flux even in an equilibrium state although the net exchanged flux is zero .",
    "the vortex hopping motion is still strong in the equilibrium state due to the reduced vortex activation energy .",
    "thus , @xmath186 is only the cause of a nonzero exchanged flux quantity ( or @xmath184 is the cause of a nontrivial flux creep process ) , but not a cause of vortex motion .",
    "the causes of vortex motion are the vortex thermal fluctuation and limited vortex activation energy .",
    "in a type - ii superconductor , the different pinning regions exchange magnetic flux ( vortices ) . this phenomenon causes the vortices in a weak pinning region to migrate to a strong pinning region .",
    "thus , it influences the flux quantities in each pinning region .",
    "the flux exchange phenomenon also occurs between the surface pinning region and bulk pinning region , the space outside the superconductor , respectively .",
    "but the vortices hop from the surface pinning region into the bulk pinning region has little influence on the average internal field in the bulk pinning region . in the calculation of total average internal field ,",
    "the contribution from the surface pinning region is significant in a small superconductor , but is ignorable in a large superconductor .",
    "further studies should be carried out on the solution of the generalized system of flux exchange , i.e. , system ( [ sde ] ) ."
