    "for the understanding , design and fabrication of optoelectronic devices , the optical properties of the involved materials have to be known .",
    "a well established and powerful method for the determination of these properties is spectroscopic ellipsometry @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the dielectric function ( df ) , which is usually obtained by means of numerical model analysis of the experimental ellipsometry data and then often described by a series of line - shape model dielectric functions in order to deduce phonon properties , free charge carrier concentrations and the properties of electronic transitions ( e.g ref .  ) . for isotropic materials",
    "this method is well established . however , in recent years , optically anisotropic materials , as e.g. ga@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , cdwo@xmath3 @xcite and lutetium oxyorthosilicate @xcite , went into focus of research since they are promising candidates for optoelectronic applications in the uv spectral range . however , the determination of their optical and electronic properties is more challenging compared to isotropic materials since they depend on the crystal orientation .",
    "the dielectric function is represented by a ( frequency - dependent ) tensor and the determination of its components requires a series of measurements for various crystal orientations .    for ( non - chiral ) optically anisotropic materials ,",
    "the dielectric function is in general a symmetric tensor consisting of six independent components @xcite , i.e. @xmath4 due to its symmetry , this tensor can be diagonalized independently for the real and imaginary part at each wavelength separately . in the transparent spectral range , i.e. for vanishing imaginary part , the diagonal elements are the semi - principal axes of the ellipsoid of wave normals and are often called dielectric axes . for materials with monoclinic or triclinic crystal structure ,",
    "the orientation of the dielectric axes depends on the wavelength and is often called colour dispersion . in",
    "the spectral rang with non - vanishing absorption , the situation becomes even more complex .",
    "due to the independent diagonalizability of the tensor ( [ eq : df_tensor_general ] ) for the real and imaginary part , the corresponding dielectric axes in general do not coincide which each other .",
    "thus , in general , four dielectric axes are present . for these classes of materials",
    "only few reports on the determination of the full dielectric tensor exists , e.g. for @xmath5-ptcda @xcite , pentacene @xcite , bifeo@xmath2 @xcite , cdwo@xmath3 @xcite , k@xmath1cr@xmath1o@xmath6 @xcite , cuso@xmath7h@xmath1o @xcite and effective anisotropic materials as e.g. slanted columnar films @xcite .",
    "most of these works are limited to the determination of the line shape of the dielectric function , treating each tensor component of the df independently of each other .",
    "this can , from a technical point of view , result in large correlations between the individual tensor elements causing non - physical results .",
    "more importantly , the deeper nature of polarizabilities in the material , like phonons , excitons , and electronic band - band transitions , can not be explored this way .",
    "thus , lineshape model dielectic functions ( mdf ) representing the oscillators properties like energy , amplitude , broadening , and even oscillation direction in a meaningful and physical correct way have to be used .    facing this , dressel _",
    "@xcite proposed an approach assuming that the dipole moments are aligned to three polarization axis which should coincide with the crystallographic axes . taking this model into account ,",
    "the dielectric tensor is fully described by its three independent principal elements and the known angles between the crystallographic axis . however , as a consequence of this approach the principal axes of the indicatrix ( related to the real part of @xmath8 ) coincide with those of the conductivity tensor ( related to the imaginary part of @xmath8 ) which is not generally valid as shown for instance for cdwo@xmath3 @xcite and ga@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite . to overcome this problem , hfer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used for the infrared spectral range a model , developed earlier by emslie _",
    "@xcite , which consists of a sum of damped lorentz oscillators individually aligned to the axes of their respective dipole moments . for phonons ,",
    "these axes are related to the atomic elongations and thus to some extent to the crystallographic axes .",
    "further , their dissipative spectral range is usually narrow .",
    "thus the question arises if such a model also can be applied to spectrally widespread excitations like electronic band - band transitions , which consist of numbers of individual dipoles whose axes are connected to overlapping atomic orbitals of various symmetry and therefore not necessarily coincide with crystallographic directions .",
    "further the density of states ( dos ) of the electronic band structure is distributed within a wide energy range in a complex manner causing non - symmetric line - shapes of the imaginary part of the dielectric function which spectrally overlap for different contributions and directions .    here",
    "we demonstrate that the sketched approach is generally valid for all kinds of excitations .",
    "we demonstrate this exemplarily for monoclinic ga@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath0-phase ) single crystals and thin films in the spectral range from infrared to vacuum ultraviolet .",
    "we show that this model provides a deep insight in electronic properties of the materials : comparing the directions of the electronic polarizabilities obtained by modeling the experimental ellipsometry data using lineshape mdf to the real space atomic arrangement in the crystal and considering theoretical calculated electron density distribution as well as orbital - resolved dos , allows us to assign the observed transitions to individual orbitals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : df ] , we discuss at first the dielectric tensor for all crystal symmetries and its composition .",
    "after that we demonstrate its applicability to the case of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals in the infrared and ultraviolet spectral range .",
    "finally , we show by means of a practically relevant @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 thin film which exhibit rotation domains that the approach of using directed transitions explains the effective uniaxial properties of the film and enhances the sensitivity to the out - of plane component of the dielectric tensor .",
    "[ sec : dielectric_function ] the optical response of a material is determined in first order by dipole excitations , e.g. optical phonons , electronic band - band transitions or excitons which in sum are represented by the dielectric function . for isotropic materials , the corresponding dipole moment or polarization direction of each excitation",
    "is macroscopically equally distributed in all spatial directions , resulting in an isotropic dielectric function , i.e. it is a scalar written as @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the number of excitations / oscillators .",
    "the situation changes for materials with crystal structure symmetry lower than the cubic one . in this case",
    "the excitations generally differ between the crystallographic directions in energy , amplitude , broadening , and even in the spatial direction of their dipole moment , and thus the df is a tensor ( eq .  ) .",
    "let @xmath11 being the dielectric response of the @xmath12 excitation and the coordinate system is chosen ( without loosing generality ) in such way that the polarization direction is along the @xmath13-axis . the only non - zero component is then given by @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "however , the polarization direction of the excitation and the experimental coordinate system do not coincide with each other in general and a coordinate transformation has to be performed , independently for each transition .",
    "the entire dielectric tensor then can be expressed by @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being euler angles , which are in general different for each excitation , and @xmath19 being the rotation matrix .",
    "the advantage of this expression is that the components of the resultant dielectric tensor in the cartesian coordinate system are not independent of each other but rather composed of the respective projected part of the excitation s line - shape function according to the directions of their individual dipole moment . for the entire dielectric function",
    "it follows that , due to the finite broadening of each excitation and by considering kramers - kronig relation , the orientation of the principal tensor axes of the real and imaginary parts differ from each other as it is well known and observed in experiments e.g. for cdwo@xmath3 @xcite and ga@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "equation   represents the general case which has to be used for triclinic crystals and can be simplified depending on the crystal symmetry .",
    "crystals with monoclinic structure exhibit one symmetry axes , representing a @xmath20 rotation axis or the normal of a mirror plane ( or both ) , which we identify in the following with the @xmath21-direction .",
    "the plane perpendicular to @xmath21 , the @xmath13-@xmath22-plane , reveals no symmetry which defines a cartesian coordinate system preferentially .",
    "therefore , from symmetry arguments , considering dipoles polarized either along @xmath21 or in the @xmath13-@xmath22-plane , one can simplify eq .   to @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the contribution of the respective directions . @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 represent the number of excitations with the corresponding polarization directions and as @xmath28 we define the angle between the polarization direction and the @xmath13-axes within the @xmath13-@xmath22-plane .",
    "this leads to the well known form of the dielectric tensor given by @xmath29    a further simplification can be made for orthorhombic materials containing three orthogonal twofold rotation symmetry axis , leading to @xmath30 a dielectric function tensor which contains only diagonal elements . in the case of uniaxial materials , e.g. those with a hexagonal symmetry , @xmath31 and @xmath32 holds . for isotropic material ,",
    "the numbers of oscillators in all three directions is the same and therefore the dielectric tensor reduces to the scalar given by eq .  .    for practical application eq",
    "has to be further modified .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function are connected with each other by the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "contributions of excitations at energies higher than the investigated spectral range to the real part of the df have to be considered .",
    "these contributions are usually described by a pole function . in the case",
    "presented here , this means that the identity in eq .   has to be replaced by a real valued tensor with the form given by the corresponding crystal structure where each component is represented by a pole function .",
    "by using the approach presented in sec .",

    "this can be understood considering the coordination of the o - atoms , which is higher ( 6 bonds ) for o(ii ) , suggesting the orbitals to be more @xmath50-like compared to o(iii ) ( 4 bonds ) which dominate the dos near the valence band maximum .",

    "finally , transition @xmath70 , directed almost along @xmath34 , was assigned to take place either between o(i ) and o(iii ) or between two o(ii ) atoms , or both . while the first possibility involves differently coordinated atoms suggesting dipole allowed transitions between @xmath49- and @xmath50-like orbitals , the second possibility involves only highly coordinated atoms ( @xmath50-like character ) and",

    "the relatively high amplitude of this transition is not clear at first place , because following ref .",

    "the effective dielectric function is given by @xmath79    with @xmath80 the rotation angle of the @xmath81 rotation domain ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 being the rotation matrix around the surface normal .",
    "equation   is similar to those of a uniaxial material with @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 : perpendicular and parallel to the optical axis ) with orientation of the effective optical axis along the surface normal .",

    "but there is a finite projection of the electro - magnetic field strength onto the optical axis and thus the optical response is determined by @xmath91 and @xmath90 in any case , which have to be considered in order to obtain a physical meaningful dielectric function @xcite . however , in contrast to a homogeneous uniaxial material , those effective @xmath91 and @xmath90 are not independent from each other . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : dielectric_function ] and demonstrated in sec .",

    "we relate these changes of the df properties compared to the bulk single crystal on the one hand to crystal imperfections typically lowering the oscillator strength of electronic transitions by dissipative processes . on the other hand",

    "<S> we apply a generalized model for the determination and analysis of the dielectric function of optically anisotropic materials with colour dispersion to phonon modes and show that it can also be generalized to excitonic polarizabilities and electronic band - band transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account that the tensor components of the dielectric function within the cartesian coordinate system are not independent from each other but are rather projections of the polarization of dipoles oscillating along directions defined by the , non - cartesian , crystal symmetry and polarizability . the dielectric function is then composed of a series of oscillators pointing in different directions . the application of this model is exemplarily demonstrated for monoclinic ( @xmath0-phase ) ga@xmath1o@xmath2 bulk single crystals . using this model , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to relate electronic transitions observed in the dielectric function to atomic bond directions and orbitals in the real space crystal structure . for thin films revealing rotational domains </S>",
    "<S> we show that the optical biaxiality is reduced to uniaxial optical response . </S>"
