    "the characteristic approach has been used successfully to carry out numerical simulations of space - times with and without sources  @xcite .",
    "a significant computational effort is nevertheless necessary to extend its range of applicability to the simulation of astrophysically relevant sources of gravitational radiation , such as the black hole - neutron star binary problem , where the approach can be most useful .",
    "as work on the characteristic formulation to date illustrates  @xcite , it is clear that most three - dimensional characteristic simulations , even vacuum simulations  @xcite are resolution - limited .",
    "this is particularly true of three - dimensional simulations of systems containing compact matter sources  @xcite , even when the matter source is an extended one . in general",
    ", all these simulations have been limited in resolution primarily because of the time required to integrate the equations numerically .",
    "for instance , at the finest resolution simulation considered in  @xcite , tracking a neutron star in ( close ) orbit around a black hole requires approximately 1.5 months even on one of the fastest processors currently available .",
    "this is so even though the grid in question ( @xmath0 angular points , @xmath1 points radially ) is fairly moderate by today s standards . to a lesser extent ,",
    "characteristic simulations are also limited because of memory requirements , although the characteristic scheme is particularly economic in this regard . even though it is feasible to equip a single - processor workstation with the 1.4 gbytes of memory required by that moderate grid size , the time required for the numerical solution on even the fastest processor would make such serial simulations highly impractical .",
    "most of the past code development in the characteristic approach  @xcite has been geared towards vector or single processor machines .",
    "the computational platforms available today require instead a parallel programming approach in order to perform large resolution simulations in a reasonable time , thus a parallel version of the characteristic code is clearly needed . in the present work",
    "we show how , with a well thought out yet modest programming effort , it is not only possible to produce an efficient , highly scalable parallel implementation of characteristic codes , but to do so in such a way that it becomes straightforward to extend our parallel implementation to new physical models .",
    "we aim for our numerical implementation to be particularly useful for long  time simulations of sources of astrophysical interest , which are very demanding in terms of the number of grid points on which to advance the solution , and thus on the number of floating point operations required . with that end in mind ,",
    "our numerical code must scale well in platforms with a large number of processors .",
    "we show here that our implementation meets this goal , making it a potentially valuable tool when applied to some of the most interesting astrophysical applications of numerical relativity , such as the study of black hole ",
    "neutron star binary systems , in the close orbit regime up to the tidal disruption of the companion star .",
    "the first astrophysical application we have in mind is a characteristic simulation of boson stars in orbit about a black hole .",
    "for that purpose we calibrate the current code for a massless scalar field minimally coupled with gravitation .",
    "this let us , beyond numerical tests , compare and calibrate our code with linear versions of it , radial codes , and analytic ( perturbative ) results reported in the literature about quasi - normal modes .",
    "the extension to a black hole ",
    "boson star system is straightforward but not trivial , deserving a detailed study of its own and enormous computational resources .",
    "we want to stress that the production of gravitational waves by the scattering of scalar waves has many mathematical features in common with the production of gravitational waves by the motion of fluid bodies .",

    "the characteristic approach to numerical relativity is based on null coordinates @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the retarded time , @xmath6 a luminosity distance and @xmath7 coordinates on the sphere  @xcite . in its 3-dimensional implementation , the angular coordinates chosen are stereographic coordinates @xmath8 on the sphere , which is covered with two stereographic coordinate patches , as first presented in ref .",
    "we summarize here the salient aspects of the approach to provide the motivation for ( and highlight the differences with ) , the implementation described in this article . the standard _ eth _",
    "approach  @xcite is a straightforward numerical implementation in stereographic coordinates @xmath8 of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 operators introduced by newman and penrose  @xcite .",
    "two stereographic patches are used to cover the unit sphere , with coordinates @xmath9 in the north patch and @xmath10 in the south patch , respectively , where @xmath11 are standard angular coordinates .    in terms of the dyad @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , vectors @xmath14 on the sphere are represented by a spin - weight 1 field @xmath15 ( or alternatively , by a spin - weight -1 field @xmath16 ) .",
    "this treatment generalizes to tensors on the sphere @xmath17 , which are represented in terms of spin - weighted functions obtained by contracting them with the dyad @xmath18 and its complex conjugate @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 the spin of the resulting scalar function is @xmath21 .",
    "angular derivatives of tensor fields are represented by the action of the spin - raising and lowering operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the angular derivatives of a vector field @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the derivatives compatible with the flat sphere metric in the coordinates @xmath7 , are represented by the spin-2 field @xmath24 and spin-0 field @xmath25 given by @xmath26 the @xmath2 and @xmath3 operators acting on a spin - weight @xmath27 function @xmath28 are equivalently defined by    @xmath29    [ eq : eth ]    where , in terms of the ( real ) coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "functions on the sphere with spin - weight @xmath27 transform between patches according to @xmath34    we implement this numerically by laying down a two - dimensional grid on each patch , with coordinates @xmath35 , @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and with the grid point indices in the range @xmath40 .",
    "this grid covers the coordinate range @xmath41 .",
    "ghost zones are used on each side of the grid for the discretization of angular derivatives by centered , second - order - accurate finite difference stencils .",
    "function values at these ghost zones are obtained by interpolation from the function values on the opposite patch . in order to compute second angular derivatives to second order accuracy",
    ", the interpolations must be evaluated to fourth - order accuracy , which can be readily attained using a sixteen - point stencil in two dimensions  @xcite , provided the grid covers no less than the range indicated above . for some applications  @xcite",
    ", we find it necessary to extend the grid to a finite overlap , i.e. @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "the set of ghost zones required for the north patch , maps onto the south patch ( and vice - versa ) as per the transformation @xmath44 , into a cloverleaf shape .",
    "regardless of the number of grid points ( or of ghost zones ) , there is a finite overlap between the north and south patches . while the points in the overlap area of each grid are redundant , we carry them all because we find it more efficient to work with rectangular grids .",
    "a potential problem of doing so is the development of two different numerical solutions in the overlap area of each patch , only loosely coupled at the stereographic patch edge .",
    "we now discuss briefly some of the drawbacks of the standard `` eth '' approach when applied to high resolution simulations in the characteristic approach to numerical relativity , and the motivation for the changes that we propose in the next section .",
    "the first objection that we encounter is in the process of parallelizing our characteristic codes .",
    "because of the radial march implicit in the radial integration of the hypersurface equations , the natural way to parallelize a characteristic simulation is to distribute the angular grid among processors , which would integrate the equations along a `` pencil '' of null rays . in the computational `` eth '' approach",
    "this means assigning the computation of the solution over a subset of each stereographic patch to a given processor . a similar arrangement , in the context of axisymmetric simulations ,",
    "was explored earlier by bishop et .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , given @xmath45 processors , we can simply partition the @xmath46 stereographic grid on each patch , assigning equal square subgrids of extent @xmath47 on each direction to each processor .",
    "load - balancing ( the requirement that all processors in a parallel computation do approximately the same amount of work ) would in principle be achieved , so long as we restricted ourselves to explicit methods , thus guaranteeing that the time spent per subgrid remains constant .",
    "the communication pattern imposed by the two stereographic patches implementation of the `` eth '' approach  @xcite does present an obstacle to effective scaling .",
    "the mapping of ghost zones at the edge of the grid to grid points in the opposing patch is not restricted to nearest neighbors . to provide values for these ghost zones",
    "requires data from a set of grid points whose values are scattered among processors in an irregular pattern ( in the sense that , depending on its location on the angular grid , the ghost zones may be obtained from one , two , or more processors ) .",
    "this procedure is not only cumbersome to program , but intrinsically inefficient .",
    "if the data required for these ghost zones could be obtained just from grid points at the edge of an adjoining grid , the procedure would simplify considerably . the time spent in communication",
    "would be substantially reduced and remain constant over the set of processors , with a significant impact on the scalability and overall efficiency of a code .",
    "unfortunately such an arrangement is not possible with a stereographic grid .",
    "in addition , as we point out at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : standard ] , because of the fixed overlap between patches , a significant portion of the grid is wasted .",
    "while this might be acceptable in small scale simulations  @xcite , it needs to be addressed in the context of large scale computations as in that case it translates into a serious waste of computational resources .    yet another problem that arises from the angular grid layout is that of highly non - uniform angular resolution , as a direct consequence of using a stereographic grid . considering the expression for the area element in stereographic coordinates , @xmath48 it can be seen that there is a marked disparity between the resolution at grid points at various places on the sphere .",
    "considerable better resolution is attained near the equator than at the poles , with the largest disparity between a grid zone at the pole ( @xmath49 ) and a point at a corner of the grid ( @xmath50 ) where the respective area elements have a ratio of 9:1 .",
    "for some situations , such as the case of a matter source in equatorial orbit around a black hole , this feature works to our advantage .",
    "conversely , for a matter source in a polar orbit , the matter source would be resolved three times as poorly when it lies along the @xmath51 axis ( @xmath52 ) compared to the resolution obtained when it crosses the equator , which in a second - order accurate code translates into a nine - fold increase in the intrinsic error in the numerical solution .",
    "one possible correction for this effect would be to maintain the standard stereographic grid as the basic computational grid , but introduce a physical grid related to the computational grid by a fish - eye stretch in the angular coordinates , and allow the refined portion of the grid to follow the compact object .",
    "a related issue is that of proper resolution of angular features , which is critical for characteristic simulations of compact objects in orbit around a black hole . in",
    "spherical coordinates , angular resolution decreases with distance to the center , as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "there is then a limit to the distance at which we can initialize a characteristic simulation , a limit which is not dictated by physical considerations , such as the need to avoid the formation of caustics , which would lead to a break down of the coordinate system .",
    "we are also limited by the number of points which can in practice be devoted to resolve a companion object .",
    "a proposed extension to the characteristic approach  @xcite would include an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) strategy , which indirectly would address both grid resolution issues mentioned .",
    "while this extension may prove necessary in simulations of the last stages of capture or disruption of a companion star by a black hole , the necessary technology has not yet been developed in the context of the characteristic approach ; to our knowledge , applications of amr in the characteristic framework have been made only in simplified one- dimensional models  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate stages of the black hole  neutron star problem , where the companion remains approximately contained in a finite region could , at least in principle , be equally well resolved with fixed mesh refinement , an approach successfully used , for example , in  @xcite . the introduction of amr carries with it a whole new set of issues , not the least of which is the problem of load - balancing in a massively parallel computer .",
    "current characteristic codes present serious obstacles to the implementation of an amr strategy by the nature of the angular grid alone . to be effective",
    ", an amr implementation would have to be capable of dealing with refined meshes in multiple coordinate patches .",
    "to our knowledge , few existing implementations have this capability  @xcite , and none have been applied in numerical relativity . in the present work we present a parallel implementation on a single distributed grid , and we defer the discussion of possible techniques for fixed and adaptive mesh refinement for future work .",
    "a key consideration for the present work is that different numerical representations of the @xmath53 approach can be developed by laying down different types of grids on the sphere .",
    "we consider here an alternative to the standard `` eth '' approach , based on the `` cubed sphere '' or `` gnomic '' covering of the sphere introduced by ronchi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on earlier work of sadourny  @xcite .",
    "this approach is now in common use in global weather simulations , such as in the mit general circulation model ( mitgcm ) , for example  @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied in astrophysical simulations  @xcite , in the study of wave propagation methods on the sphere  @xcite , and more recently , in the evolution of scalar fields in a fixed background  @xcite . while preparing this manuscript , we learned  @xcite of work being carried out by bishop _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , on a similar grid arrangement , based on work by thornburg  @xcite .        in the ` cubed sphere ' method , a covering of the unit sphere with six non - overlapping patches results from projecting the sphere from its center onto the six faces of a circumscribing cube ,",
    "whose edges have length two .",
    "for example , for points on the sphere with cartesian coordinates @xmath54 and angular coordinate @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) , we project the point by tracing a line from the center of the sphere though the point @xmath57 to the @xmath58 face of the circumscribing cube , determining a point with cartesian coordinates @xmath59 , we then label the point on the sphere according to the cartesian coordinates @xmath60 of its projection on the plane @xmath58 .    in order to obtain a covering of the sphere with nearly uniform area , we label the points on the sphere by angular coordinates @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , introducing an equally spaced grid in the angular coordinates @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "similar projections from the center of the sphere to the other faces of the cube provide a covering of the sphere with six patches .    for a finite - difference code , this arrangement is ideal , as the grid on each patch is equally spaced in the angular coordinates , and the same angular coordinate is used on any two patches in the direction perpendicular to a boundary .",
    "thus any additional layers of ghost zones in the adjacent grid will fall on coordinate lines parallel to the boundary . evaluating function values at those ghost zones",
    "requires only one  dimensional interpolation along coordinate lines parallel to the boundary .",
    "for example , an @xmath67-th order centered stencil requires @xmath68 additional layers of ghost cells to be supplied along the edge of each spherical cap .",
    "the order of the interpolations used to supply these points can be selected so as to preserve the accuracy and maintain the desired dissipation properties of the numerical scheme . in the standard configuration  @xcite ,",
    "the spherical caps share common points along the edges of the grid , where two grids abut , and at the corners of each patch , where three grids meet .",
    "these common points must have a unique value on each of the grids that share them .",
    "an approach advocated in the literature  @xcite is to replace the function values at these shared points by some form of weighted average .",
    "here we dispense with this procedure , by carefully selecting the range of the angular coordinates in each patch , in a way that precludes the existence of points common to two ( or three ) cubed  sphere patches .",
    "an advantage of a _ gnomic _ decomposition of the sphere , crucial to an efficient parallel implementation of the numerical @xmath2 approach , is that the patches can be laid out so that they are non - overlapping .",
    "in contrast , in a stereographic covering , there is a finite overlap , which does not shrink in size as we increase the grid resolution .",
    "although it is possible to construct a six  patch stereographic covering of the sphere , in which the amount of overlap is reduced with respect to the two  patch covering , the area of the overlap zone remains constant , regardless of grid size .",
    "non - conformal projections are based on non - orthogonal coordinates , thus there is no symmetry in some operators such as the laplacian on the sphere .",
    "it is still straightforward to couple a gnomic grid layout with the existing @xmath2 approach , i.e. while continuing to express the @xmath2 and @xmath3 operators of ref .",
    "@xcite on stereographic coordinates . in the following we",
    "detail how this is implemented by expressing the angular ( stereographic ) derivatives in terms of angular derivatives in gnomic coordinates .",
    "a gnomic covering of the sphere is given by six coordinate patches    @xmath69    where @xmath70 , @xmath71 are the cartesian coordinates of the points , @xmath72 are coordinates on the sphere in the range @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
