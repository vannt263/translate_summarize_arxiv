    "the recent progress in ultracold atomic gases experiments provides an important test bed for studying the isolated quantum many - body systems , where these systems are sufficiently weakly coupled to the external environment  @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics after quenching in quantum systems is one of the hot topics . in an isolated system of conserved finite particles",
    ", one may ask in what conditions the microcanonical and cannonical ensembles are equivalent ?    according to statistical mechanics , the momentum distribution function ( mdf ) in a canonical ensemble is the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) function for a system of identical fermions ( bosons )  @xcite . the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) function",
    "is first derived in an ideal gas of fermions ( bosons ) , but now they are generally used in interacting systems in terms of fermi liquid theory  @xcite , where the free fermions ( bosons ) are replaced by the emergent quasiparticles with renormalized energies . however , the mdf in a microcanonical ensemble is difficult to calculate directly .",
    "a textbook derivation of the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) function in microcanonical ensembles  @xcite is based on an assumption that the mdf is the most probable distribution guaranteed by the principle of the equivalence of ensembles , which states that the macroscopic observables ( e.g. , the mdf ) in canonical and microcanonical ensembles are the same in the absence of long - range interactions in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "however , it is obliged to study in which conditions the equivalence of ensembles breaks down in a finite system .",
    "recently , the mdf in cold - atom systems after a quantum quench causes great interests both in theory and experiments  @xcite . in a system",
    "far from integrability , according to the eigenstate thermalization hyperthesis  @xcite , the steady state after a quench can be described by an ensemble of eigenstates  @xcite , close to each other in energy . in other words",
    ", a non - integrable system will thermalize into a microcanonical ensemble  @xcite . at the same time , a typical cold - atom system in experiments contains only a few thousand particles  @xcite , far from the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the mdf of microcanonical ensembles in a finite system is now accessible in experiments implemented on ultracold atoms .",
    "then it is necessary to revisit the mdf in microcanonical ensembles when the equivalence of ensembles breaks down in a finite system .    in a finite one - dimensional system ,",
    "rigol studied the inequivalence of the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles  @xcite . in a system of non - interacting fermions a numerical comparison between the mdfs in microcanonical and canonical ensembles with equidistant single - particle levels",
    "is discussed at some special energies  @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic study of the inequivalence between microcanonical and canonical ensembles is still lack .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the low - energy state , when the system energy is comparable with the inverse of the single - particle density of state which is nonzero in a finite system .",
    "obviously , the mdf must be zero when the single - particle energy exceeds the system energy , indicating that it is not a smooth function , different from the fermi - dirac ( boso - einstein ) function at finite temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the mdf in microcanonical ensembles .",
    "we suppose that the system is finite by setting a finite single - particle density of state .",
    "we calculate the microcanonical mdf ( mmdf ) by relating it to the canonical mdf ( cmdf ) .",
    "a well - known relation between canonical and microcanonical ensembles is that canonical ensembles describe the subsystems of a microcanonical ensemble  @xcite . in this paper , we show that the mmdf of a system can also be calculated according to its cmdf .",
    "we find that the mmdf deviates from the cmdf at low energies , while becoming equivalent at high energies .",
    "our results show the breakdown of the equivalence principle , at the same time provide a way to understand the mdf in cold - atom systems after a quench , which is believed to be the mmdf , while difficult to address directly due to the lack of reliable analytical or numerical methods  @xcite .",

    "its mdf is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inverse of the temperature and @xmath2 the quasiparticle energy .",

    "( [ emdfmicro ] ) is exactly the average of the microcanonical ensemble of the mdf , denoted as @xmath17 .    the definition of microcanonical ensemble demands that the number of eigenstates in the energy interval must be large enough to make the function @xmath17 smooth .",
    "this condition can be naturally satisfied by converting the sum to @xmath12 into an integral over @xmath12 ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",

    "we find that the equivalence of ensembles breaks down at low energies by showing that the mmdf is different from the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) function .",

    "the inequivalence of ensembles has been intensively discussed in classical mechanics in the presence of long - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "our results must be distinguished from those discussions , because the inequivalence of ensembles in our paper is a finite - size effect due to the quantization of excitations .",

    "this suggests that the system is two- or three - dimensional , since the one - dimensional fermions are described by a luttinger liquid  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the condition that the inequivalence of ensembles is obvious in two dimensions .",

    "we use the relation between the temperature and the system energy obtained above and finally we get @xmath81 . the inequivalence of ensembles is obvious as @xmath82 . then the temperature must be inversely proportional to the system area .",
    "when considering a system of @xmath83k atoms  @xcite with the mass @xmath84 and a typical area of two - dimensional fermi gas @xmath85 , we obtain the typical temperature @xmath86 where the inequivalence of ensembles can be observed .",

    "the mmdf is a step function at low energies , while changes into a smooth one as the energy increasing .",
    "taking the limit @xmath68 , we get @xmath98 .",
    "this indicates that at low energies the bosonic mmdf as a function of quasiparticle energy decreases in a power way instead of in an exponential way suggested by the bose - einstein function .",
    "the condition of observing this power law decay is that @xmath63 is not too large so that the second order approximation to @xmath48 is effective .",
    "in summary , we calculate mmdfs in a system of fermions and bosons . the mmdf given in this paper is universal in systems where the corresponding cmdf of quasiparticles is the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) function and the low energy excitations are gapless .",
    "the mmdf is found to be different from the cmdf at low energies as @xmath75 , where @xmath88 is the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "it shows a sawtooth shape for fermions and a power - law decay for bosons .",
    "our results show the breakdown of the equivalence of ensembles , as a result of the quantization of quasiparticle excitations which can only be observed in small systems , since @xmath88 is proportional to the system volume .",
