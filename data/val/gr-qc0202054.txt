    "the special theory of relativity deals with physics in minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "the test observers in this theory are in general noninertial ; for the results of measurements of a noninertial observer , the theory asserts that such an observer is locally inertial (  hypothesis of locality \" ) . in this way",
    ", lorentz invariance may be applied in a pointwise manner to make physical predictions regarding what accelerated observers measure .",
    "thus lorentz invariance and the hypothesis of locality together constitute the pillars of the special theory of relativity .    the inhomogeneous lorentz transformations ( i.e. elements of the poincar group ) connect the physical measurements of ideal inertial observers .",
    "these have a special significance : the fundamental laws of microphysics involve quantities that are ultimately measured by such ideal inertial observers .",
    "however , all actual observers are accelerated .",
    "it is therefore necessary to specify how the measurements of an accelerated observer can be connected with the basic laws of physics ; that is , a connection is needed between the accelerated and inertial observers .",
    "the hypothesis of locality provides such a connection as it postulates that an accelerated observer is at each instant equivalent  in terms of measurements of physical quantities  to an otherwise identical hypothetical inertial observer that has the same state ( i.e. position and velocity ) as the accelerated observer .",
    "the approximate nature of this assumption , which is natural from the standpoint of newtonian mechanics , was discussed by lorentz in the specific context of his electron theory @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of locality extends to all measuring devices the assumption that the rods and clocks of the standard theory of relativity are locally inertial @xcite .",
    "if the duration of the basic phenomenon measured by the noninertial observer is such that its velocity vector and spatial reference frame do not change appreciably over this time interval , then the observer may be regarded as inertial and the hypothesis of locality is valid ; that is , the acceleration of the observer is locally immaterial . to quantify this criterion",
    ", we note that there are certain invariant acceleration time scales @xmath1 , given typically by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , associated with a noninertial observer .",
    "these are related to the magnitudes of the observer s translational acceleration @xmath4 and the rotational frequency @xmath5 of its spatial frame , respectively @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is the intrinsic time scale of the phenomenon under observation , then the expected deviation from the hypothesis of locality is @xmath7 .",
    "such a deviation turns out to be too small to be detectable in most physics experiments . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us note that experiments are typically performed in a laboratory fixed on the rotating earth , where @xmath8 year and @xmath9 hours , while for a laser beam @xmath10 second .",
    "in this way , one can account for the great success of the standard theory of relativity . as a matter of principle , however , it would be interesting to construct a viable theory of accelerated observers in minkowski spacetime that goes beyond the hypothesis of locality .",
    "such a nonlocal theory of accelerated systems is described in section  2 . for the sake of concreteness , electromagnetic radiation fields",
    "are considered throughout this paper ; however , the final results in their general form would be valid for any field .",
    "the nonlocal theory of section  2 involves a kernel that needs to be determined on the basis of physical principles discussed in section  3 . in this way ,",
    "a class of bounded continuous kernels is identified . in section  4 , the resulting nonlocal theory is confronted with observational data regarding the measurement of electromagnetic radiation fields by a uniformly rotating observer .",
    "thereby a unique kernel is tentatively identified .",
    "the final section contains a discussion of our results .",
    "we consider a global inertial frame in minkowski spacetime with coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "this is the only coordinate system that is needed here ; in particular , we avoid the use of  accelerated coordinate systems \" due to their fundamental limitations associated with the measurement of distance in such systems @xcite .",
    "the accelerated observer follows a worldline with tangent vector @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the proper time along the path .",
    "the observer refers its measurements to an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath14 defined along its worldline such that @xmath15 here the scalars @xmath16 form an antisymmetric acceleration tensor such that the  electric \" and  magnetic \" parts correspond to the acceleration @xmath4 of the observer @xmath17 and the rotation frequency @xmath5 of its spatial frame @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we note that along its worldline the accelerated observer passes through a continuous infinity of hypothetical instantaneously comoving inertial observers each with the instantaneous tetrad frame @xmath14 . to avoid unphysical situations involving the expenditure of an infinite amount of energy in order to keep the observer accelerated ,",
    "we assume that the acceleration is turned on at @xmath19 and turned off at a later time @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be an electromagnetic radiation field in minkowski spacetime ; in fact , @xmath21 is the faraday tensor as measured by the standard set of static inertial observers in the background global frame .",
    "let @xmath22 be the corresponding radiation field as measured by the accelerated observer .",
    "the hypothesis of locality implies that the field as measured by the accelerated observer is given at each point along the worldline by the field as measured by the hypothetical momentarily comoving inertial observer .",
    "for such an observer the measured field is the projection of @xmath23 upon its tetrad frame by lorentz invariance , i.e. @xmath24 the accelerated observer passes through an infinite sequence of such momentarily comoving inertial observers ; therefore , the most general linear relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath25 consistent with causality is @xcite @xmath26 it is important to recognize that this ansatz only involves spacetime scalars ; moreover , the kernel @xmath27 must vanish for an inertial observer .",
    "therefore , the nonlocal ansatz is physically reasonable if @xmath27 is related to the acceleration of the observer .",
    "equation   has the form of a volterra integral equation of the second kind @xcite .",
    "it follows from volterra s theorem that in the space of continuous functions the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath21 is unique @xcite .",
    "this uniqueness result has been extended to the hilbert space of square - integrable functions by tricomi  @xcite . in this sense , therefore , we assume boundedness as well as continuity throughout this paper . further details regarding acceleration - induced nonlocality can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of locality has a consequence that goes against the spirit of relativity theory : a pure radiation field can stand completely still with respect to a uniformly rotating observer .",
    "this is most easily seen for the case of an observer rotating uniformly with frequency @xmath28 about the direction of propagation  characterized by the unit vector @xmath29of a plane electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the fourier analysis of @xmath31 in this case reveals that @xmath32 , where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to positive ( negative ) helicity incident radiation .",
    "this result differs from the transverse doppler effect @xmath33 that involves the time dilation factor @xmath34 ; moreover , the subtraction and addition of frequencies has a simple intuitive interpretation .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation field rotates about the direction of propagation with frequency @xmath35 for a positive ( negative ) helicity wave ; therefore , the rotating observer perceives radiation of definite helicity but with frequency @xmath36 .",
    "the deviation of this result from the transverse doppler effect provides an instance of the general phenomenon of spin - rotation coupling .",
    "partial observational evidence for this general coupling is reviewed in @xcite . in the case of electromagnetic radiation with @xmath37 ,",
    "experimental results in favor of this coupling are available in the microwave and optical domains @xcite ; moreover , this effect has been observed for radio waves @xmath38 as a phase wrap - up in the gps system as described in @xcite .",
    "in all the experimentally viable cases at present @xmath39 ; in this regime , the spin - rotation coupling has therefore a solid observational basis for electromagnetic radiation @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath40 for positive helicity radiation of frequency @xmath41",
    ", i.e. the wave stands completely still with respect to the observer . more generally , for oblique incidence @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , is the multipole parameter such that @xmath44 is the component of the total angular momentum of the radiation field along the axis of rotation of the observer ; as before , a multipole radiation field with @xmath45 can stand completely still with respect to the rotating observer  @xcite . in the case of inertial observers , this can not occur since the speed of the observer is always less than the speed of light @xcite .",
    "thus in the formula for the doppler effect @xmath46 , @xmath40 implies that @xmath47 .",
    "we demand that the same should happen for the accelerated observer in the nonlocal theory .",
    "that is , we postulate that a fundamental radiation field can never stand completely still with respect to _ any _ observer . thus if @xmath22 turns out to be constant in equation  , then @xmath21 should be constant as well . expressing the faraday tensor as a six - vector @xmath48 and writing equation   in matrix notation as @xmath49",
    ", we note that equation   can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the restriction of the field measured by the standard static inertial observers to the worldline of the accelerated observer .",
    "thus in equation   a constant @xmath52 would imply a constant @xmath53 only if @xmath54 where @xmath55 . once the kernel is determined using equation  , it follows from the volterra - tricomi uniqueness theorem that for any true radiation field @xmath21 , the accelerated observer will never measure a constant field ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .    to determine the kernel @xmath56 , equation",
    "must be solved under the requirements that ( i ) @xmath57 exists due to the temporal variation of @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 if @xmath58 is constant , since the kernel must vanish for an inertial observer and ( ii ) the nonlocal contribution to the field in equation   is always bounded .",
    "this latter requirement turns out to be crucial . to see this ,",
    "let us consider two possible solutions of equation   assuming that @xmath57 is a function of only one variable : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in the first case , equation   is solved by simple differentiation and the result is @xcite @xmath62 the second case involving a convolution kernel is more complicated ; nevertheless , equation   is sufficient to determine @xmath63 uniquely .",
    "requirement ( i ) is satisfied in either case ; moreover , they give the _ same _ kernel for _ uniform _ accelerated motion .",
    "however , for nonuniform acceleration the convolution kernel can lead to divergence @xcite in contrast to equation  .",
    "thus the first case , where the kernel is directly proportional to the acceleration of the observer gives an acceptable solution called the _ kinetic kernel _ @xcite .",
    "once an acceptable solution of equation   is available , such as the kinetic kernel @xmath64 , then the general solution may be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a @xmath67 matrix that vanishes for constant @xmath58 and involves bounded continuous functions such that @xmath68 it follows from an application of the general theory of fourier series that over the interval @xmath69 $ ] , @xmath70 is a linear superposition of functions of the form @xmath71 for any integer @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are bounded continuous matrix - valued functions . in this way ,",
    "equation   is satisfied and all that remains is to ensure that the time dependence of @xmath74 is _ solely _ due to the variation of @xmath75 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath70 must vanish for a constant @xmath58 is satisfied by expressing @xmath76 as a double series @xmath77 where @xmath78 are constants such that the double series is absolutely convergent . here",
    "@xmath79 is a @xmath67 matrix that is constant with respect to @xmath80 and such that @xmath81 whenever @xmath58 is constant . a class of such functions is given by @xmath82 where",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 are bounded continuous functions and @xmath85 let us note that @xmath78 may also be proportional to constants of the form given by equation  . combining these results , we may therefore express @xmath70 as a uniformly convergent series @xmath86 where @xmath73 is given by equations  . substituting equation   in equation  , we find the general form of the kernel @xmath57 that satisfies our physical requirements .",
    "we must next consider the physical consequences of the general kernel for the nonlocal theory .",
    "the field measured by the accelerated observer is obtained from the substitution of equation   in equation  .",
    "we observe that in the calculation of @xmath87 beyond the kinetic kernel , all terms would involve expressions of the form @xmath88 for @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that @xmath89 thus the measured field consists of a superposition of what would be expected on the basis of the kinetic kernel alone together with @xmath90 that consists of the extra terms proportional to @xmath91",
    ". it would be interesting to examine the physical consequences of the presence of the extra terms in the field as measured by an accelerated observer .",
    "this is done in the next section for an observer rotating uniformly with @xmath92 , since excellent observational data are available in this case for the coupling of the angular momentum of the electromagnetic radiation field to the rotation of the observer @xcite .",
    "the observational results regarding spin - rotation coupling for electromagnetic radiation described in @xcite may be used as evidence against the presence of @xmath90 in equation  . to this end",
    ", we consider a plane monochromatic wave of frequency @xmath30 and definite helicity that is normally incident on an observer rotating uniformly with frequency @xmath93 on a circle of radius @xmath94 in the @xmath95-plane .",
    "experiments indicate that the measured frequency is @xmath96 , where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to incident positive ( negative ) helicity radiation and @xmath97 is the lorentz factor corresponding to @xmath98 with @xmath99",
    ". we will compare and contrast this result with the predicted spectrum based on equations   and .",
    "the uniformly rotating observer has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we assume that for @xmath100 the observer moves along a straight line with uniform speed ( @xmath101 ) such that @xmath102 and @xmath103 and at @xmath104 begins uniform circular motion with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 .",
    "the natural orthonormal tetrad frame of the uniformly rotating observer is given by @xmath108 the acceleration tensor @xmath16 is given in this case by a centripetal acceleration @xmath109 and a rotation frequency @xmath5@xmath110 with respect to the tetrad frame .",
    "the incident field along the worldline of the observer may be expressed as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant complex amplitude , `` c.  c. '' indicates the corresponding complex conjugate term , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the upper ( lower ) sign indicates positive ( negative ) helicity radiation . here",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 indicate unit vectors along the positive @xmath117 and @xmath118 axes , respectively .",
    "the field as measured by the hypothetical comoving inertial observers is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 the kinetic kernel , which can be worked out using equations  , and turns out to be a constant matrix @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 . here",
    "@xmath124 , is a @xmath125 matrix proportional to the operator of infinitesimal rotations about the @xmath126-axis . if in equation   @xmath127 for all integers @xmath72 , then @xmath128 and the observed field is @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 this field is only due to the kinetic kernel  @xcite . for @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath52 involves a small constant term with amplitude @xmath132 and a harmonic term of frequency @xmath133 , as expected .",
    "the predicted constant term is a direct result of nonlocality and has not yet been experimentally verified ; however , it may be rather difficult to search for such a term of very small amplitude @xmath132 in the presence of noise .    to find the frequency spectrum of the extra field @xmath90 ,",
    "let us note that the substitution of equation   in equation   results in an expression for @xmath134 that exhibits transient as well as steady - state behaviors .",
    "the nature of the transients is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "for observational purposes , we are only interested in the steady - state behavior of @xmath91 . at late times",
    "@xmath135 , @xmath91 approaches a steady state given by @xmath136 which is independent of @xmath137 .",
    "once the steady state is established , @xmath91 is real and can be expressed as a constant term together with a harmonic term of frequency @xmath33 .",
    "let us next consider the frequency content of @xmath74 given by equation  .",
    "we note that @xmath138 we can determine the frequency content of @xmath74 by taking derivatives of equation   with respect to @xmath13 and using the fact that for @xmath139 @xmath140 where @xmath141 indicates terms proportional to either @xmath142 or @xmath143 with amplitudes that are smaller than the corresponding amplitude of the main term by a factor of @xmath144 . combining these results ,",
    "we find that the fourier content of @xmath90 is given in this case as follows : the term proportional to @xmath145 consists of a constant plus a harmonic term of frequency @xmath146 , which disagrees with observation . the next term proportional to @xmath147",
    "consists of harmonic terms with frequencies @xmath133 and @xmath148 ; the latter term is contrary to observation .",
    "moreover , the term proportional to @xmath78 for @xmath149 would contain principal harmonics @xmath150 and @xmath151 that would be in contradiction with experimental results as well as terms whose amplitudes would be smaller by a factor of @xmath144 . we can thus conclude that either @xmath128 or that its amplitude is so small as to have escaped detection thus far . we may therefore proceed with the tentative assumption that @xmath128 and the kinetic kernel is unique , while keeping in mind the possibility that future experimental data may prompt us to take @xmath90 into account as well .",
    "this eventuality appears highly unlikely , however , from a theoretical standpoint since @xmath152 for @xmath92 emerges from the simple kinematics of maxwell s theory @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have looked for bounded continuous kernels within the framework of the nonlocal theory of accelerated observers that would be consistent with lorentz invariance and satisfy the requirement that a basic radiation field would never stand completely still with respect to an accelerated observer .",
    "concentrating on electrodynamics and taking into account observational data regarding spin - rotation coupling , we find that the kinetic kernel @xmath153 given by equation   is the only one consistent with the data thus far .",
    "we therefore adopt the kinetic kernel for the nonlocal theory in general , regardless of the nature of the field .    for the kinetic kernel , the nonlocal contribution to the field has the character of a weighted average such that the weight function is proportional to the acceleration of the noninertial observer .",
    "this result is consistent with the idea put forward by bohr and rosenfeld  @xcite that the measured field is an average over a spacetime region . for the case of an accelerated observer",
    ", the spacetime region reduces to the past worldline of the observer due to certain basic limitations on the measurement of distance discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bohr and rosenfeld  @xcite considered only inertial observers for which the weight function would be unity due to the homogeneity and isotropy of inertial frames of reference .",
    "however , the field measurements of a noninertial observer would be weighted according to its acceleration along its past worldline .",
