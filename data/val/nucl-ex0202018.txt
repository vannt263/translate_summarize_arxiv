    "in heavy ion reactions particle production at high transverse momentum is expected to result from parton scatterings with large momentum transfer . in n+n reactions these hard scatterings",
    "dominate particle production above @xmath2  gev/@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "hard scattering in heavy ion collisions will occur in the early stage of the reaction , well before a quark - gluon plasma is expected to form .",
    "thus , fast partons produced in hard scatterings interact with the extended medium that is subsequently produced in a heavy ion reaction .",
    "the interaction of partons with hot and dense nuclear matter leads to an energy loss of the partons .",
    "this parton energy loss is considered as a potential signature of a quark - gluon plasma formation since the energy loss in a medium of deconfined quarks and gluons is expected to be higher than in hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "an observable consequence of parton energy loss is the suppression of hadron production at large transverse momenta relative to a baseline expectation in the absence of energy loss .",
    "the construction of this baseline necessarily relies on model assumption . for the description of",
    "hard scattering processes the nucleons of the two colliding nuclei can be approximated as incoherent superpositions of partons . in this picture the particle yields in a heavy ion reaction are expected to scale with the number @xmath4 of inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions , since the cross - section for hard processes is small .",
    "thus , the results on neutral pion production are presented in terms of the following ratio of invariant yields @xmath5 : @xmath6 this ratio is usually denoted as the nuclear modification factor . in the absence of nuclear modifications to hard scattering @xmath7 will be unity .",
    "calculations based on perturbative qcd are a second possibility for the construction of a baseline expectation .",
    "these calculations usually also phenomenologically model the multiple initial scatterings of the partons in a a+a reaction . by just comparing the hadron yield in a+a reaction with the scaled n+n reference , as in equation  [ eq : raa ]",
    ", the effect of multiple parton scattering is not taken into account .",
    "multiple parton scattering can explain the enhancement of high-@xmath1 hadron production in p+a reactions relative to a @xmath4-scaled n+n reference .",
    "this anomalous enhancement is usually referred to as the cronin - effect . in order to fix",
    "the strength of initial parton scattering in the modeling of a+a reactions data for p+a reactions at the same energy are very important .",
    "the wa98 experiment at the cern sps and the phenix experiment at rhic reconstruct neutral pions on a statistical basis via their decay into two photons .",
    "the photon detector leda of the wa98 experiment consists of 10.080 lead glass modules and covers the pseudorapidity interval @xmath8 .",
    "after the last wa98 data taking in 1996 the wa98 lead glass detector was brought from cern to the brookhaven national laboratory and is now part of the phenix experiment .",
    "phenix consists of two separate electromagnetic calorimeters : the lead glass detector ( pbgl ) and a lead - scintillator ( pbsc ) sampling calorimeter .",
    "both detectors cover the pseudorapidity interval @xmath9 .",
    "the pbgl and pbsc data were analyzed separately .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi0cen ] shows the agreement of the final @xmath10 spectra @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath4 of inelastic binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in wa98 and in phenix is determined within a glauber model framework @xcite .",
    "the glauber - model is based on a purely geometric picture of a nucleus - nucleus collision : nucleons travel on straight - line trajectories and a collision between two nucleons takes place if their distance in the plane transverse to the beam axis is smaller than a certain value given by the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section increases from @xmath11  mb at cern sps energies ( @xmath12  gev ) to @xmath13  mb at the rhic energy of @xmath14  gev .",
    "the neutral pion yields in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath15  gev and in central au+au collisions at @xmath16  gev are shown in figure  [ fig : pi0cen ] @xcite .",
    "the yields are normalized to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the measured @xmath10 spectra are compared to results for nucleon - nucleon reactions .",
    "the n+n references is a parameterization that is based on an interpolation of existing data to the respective center - of - mass energy @xcite .",
    "one observes that the @xmath10 spectrum in n+n reactions at the rhic energy is significantly flatter than the corresponding spectrum at the cern sps energy .",
    "the curvature of the @xmath10 spectrum in a+a reactions , however , changes only moderately when going from sps to rhic .",
    "figure  [ fig : cen_pp ] shows the ratio @xmath7 as defined in equation  [ eq : raa ] .",
    "the phenix pbgl and pbsc results were averaged for this plot .",
    "a striking difference between the results for the sps and rhic energy can be seen .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 for @xmath15  gev is qualitatively in line with expectations from the cronin effect : @xmath7 increases with @xmath1 and the neutral pion yield increases stronger than @xmath4 above @xmath19  gev/@xmath3 . at @xmath16  gev , however , @xmath7 is basically flat .",
    "moreover , @xmath7 is significantly below unity over the entire @xmath1 range .",
    "thus , high-@xmath1 neutral pion production at rhic energies is suppressed compared to the @xmath4-scaled n+n reference .     as defined in equation  [ eq : raa ] for neutral pion spectra at cern sps and rhic energy . for the wa98 data",
    "points the error due to the uncertainty of the n+n reference and due to the uncertainty of @xmath4 is indicated by brackets .",
    "the errors bars of the phenix data points indicate the statistical errors .",
    "the systematical errors , indicated by shaded areas , include the uncertainties of the n+n reference and of @xmath4 .",
    ", height=264 ]    one can now replace the n+n reference by the @xmath4-normalized @xmath10 spectrum measured in peripheral a+a collisions .",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ fig : cen_per ] .",
    "the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions for the peripheral samples are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cen_per ] indicates that the @xmath4 normalized peripheral @xmath10 spectrum at rhic is very similar to the respective n+n spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the comparison of the sps results in figure  [ fig : cen_pp ] and figure  [ fig : cen_per ] shows that the shape of the @xmath10 spectrum changes significantly when going from n+n to peripheral pb+pb collisions with @xmath22 .",

    "a pqcd calculation from wang described in @xcite is compared to the central @xmath10 spectrum for pb+pb collisions at @xmath15  gev/@xmath3 in figure  [ fig : pqcd]a . in the range around @xmath23",
    "gev/@xmath24 the pqcd calculation overpredicts the experimental data by around 30% . in a recent publication",
    "also lvai et al .",
    "compare their pqcd calculations to wa98 data @xcite . in agreement with wang s calculation",
    "they find that their pqcd calculation predicts more neutral pions at high @xmath1 than actually measured .",
    "thus , one can conclude that a possible parton energy loss effect ( `` jet quenching '' ) is not ruled out at sps energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : pqcd]b shows a comparison of the phenix neutral pion spectrum in central au+au collisions with a pqcd calculation from wang @xcite .",
    "the standard pqcd calculation without parton energy loss effects clearly fails to describe the data points . by introducing a parton energy loss parameter a reasonably description of the data",
    "can be reached . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that when the expansion of the fireball is appropriately taken into account the energy loss of @xmath25  gev / fm in an expanding system effectively corresponds to a much higher energy loss in a static system .",
    "this implies that the energy loss in the initial fireball produced in a a+a collision at rhic is significantly higher than in cold nuclear matter .",
