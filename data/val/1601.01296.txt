    "two - particle correlations in azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity ( @xmath10 ) is an valuable tool to study the space - time dynamics of the heavy ion collisions .",
    "one important recent result is the observation of the long - range ridge correlation in @xmath3 and @xmath1 collisions , with a magnitude comparable to those observed in pb+pb collisions at similar multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "there are presently significant debates on the origin of the apparent collectivity in small collision systems , whether this is a final state effect signifying a qgp - like matter or this is a initial state effect associated with strong qcd field .",
    "to clarify the situation , it is crucial to understand the nature of the sources of particle production that seed these long - range collective ridges : what are these sources made of and how many ?",
    "what are their sizes and distribution in the transverse direction ?",
    "forward - backward ( fb ) multiplicity correlation provides a handle on these questions . due to quantum fluctuations of the nuclear wavefunction ,",
    "the number of colliding objects , participating nucleons or in general colliding partons , in the target and those in the projectile are not the same on the event - by - event ( ebye ) basis  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry leads to correlation of particles with large pseudorapidity separation ( long - range correlations or lrc ) .",
    "the colliding objects also serve as the sources for particle production which drive the transverse flow dynamics : the eccentricity of a collision depends on the distribution of the sources in the transverse plane , and it usually decreases with the number of sources @xmath11 as @xmath12 . therefore measuring the lrc also provides important information on the initial condition for the transverse collective dynamics in @xmath3 , @xmath1 and pb+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "many previous studies in this direction are based on fb correlations of particle multiplicity in two @xmath10 ranges symmetric around the centre - of - mass of the collision system .",
    "this study is based on measuring a simple 2-d correlation function in @xmath10  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the multiplicity density distribution in a single event and @xmath15 is the average distribution for a given event - multiplicity class .",
    "the correlation function is directly related to a single - particle quantity @xmath16 , which characterizes the fluctuation of multiplicity in a single event relative to the average shape of the event class .",
    "the @xmath17 is constructed using the usual event - mixing method , and a renormalization procedure is used to remove the residual centrality dependence in @xmath18 , with the resulting correlation function denoted by @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the @xmath16 in three typical pb+pb events in the 10 - 15% centrality interval  @xcite .",
    "the apparent non - uniform structures reflect both the statistical fluctuations and dynamical fluctuations of interest .",
    "the advantage of the correlation function is that the statistical fluctuations natrually drop out after the averaging ( eq .  [ eq:1 ] ) and only the dynamical fluctuations remain .",
    "the multiplicity distributions of three typical events in 15-20% centrality interval .",
    "they are divided by the average distribution of all events in the same centrality interval .",

    "events are classified according to the total number of reconstructed charged particles , @xmath23 , with @xmath6 and transverse momentum @xmath7 gev .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , the range of @xmath23 distribution is much broader in pb+pb collisions than that in @xmath1 collisions which in turn is much broader than that in the @xmath3 collisions .",
    "therefore , the probability for events with large @xmath23 in @xmath3 collisions is much smaller than that in pb+pb collisions .",
    "one interesting question is whether the long - range multiplicity correlation is controlled by @xmath23 similar to the ridge phenomena or it also depends on other quantities .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows charge dependent pb+pb correlation functions in @xmath24 multiplicity range .",
    "the correlation functions show a broad peak along @xmath25 associated with short - range correlations ( src ) , and a depletion at large @xmath26 associated with lrc .",
    "the src reflects correlations within the same source , while the lrc reflects fb - asymmetry of the number of sources .",
    "the magnitude of src differs by more than factor of three between same - charge and opposite - charge pairs , while the lrc are nearly identical between the two charge combinations .",
    "based on this , a data - driven method was developed to separate the src from lrc .",
