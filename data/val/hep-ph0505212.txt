    "a heavy ion collision first produce a quark - gluon plasma that is in approximate local equilibrium and/or expanding hydrodynamically ? at the very least , it would be useful and interesting to answer this question in a simplifying theoretical limit : that of arbitrarily high - energy collisions , where the running strong coupling @xmath0 at relevant scales is arbitrarily small due to asymptotic freedom",
    ". even this weak - coupling limit is rich and complicated .",
    "various authors have used weak - coupling techniques to study the initial creation and interaction of the non - perturbatively dense small-@xmath1 glue which will eventually develop into the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the effects of two - particle scattering and bremsstrahlung on subsequently equilibrating the plasma , once the initial small-@xmath1 glue has expanded and diluted to perturbative densities , where it can be treated as a collection of individual gluons .",
    "however , it now seems clear that the process of thermalization is not controlled solely by such individual particle collisions in the weak - coupling limit @xcite ; one must account for collective processes in the plasma in the form of plasma instabilities .",
    "the instabilities are known as weibel or filamentary instabilities @xcite , and they have a very long history in traditional plasma physics . their possible relevance to qgp equilibration has been proposed for roughly twenty years by  and others .    in the case of electromagnetism ,",
    "a simple example of a weibel instability appears for two uniform , interpenetrating beams of charged particles traveling in opposite directions , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : filaments]a . crudely think of each beam as a superposition of many wires carrying current , and recall that parallel wires magnetically attract if their currents are aligned , or repel if opposite .",

(",
    "a ) two uniform , inter - penetrating beams of charged particles , moving left and right ; ( b ) the filamentation of those beams by the weibel instability . ]",
    "there are magnetic fields associated with the filaments in fig .",
    "[ fig : filaments]b .",
    "as the instability progresses , these fields become stronger and stronger .",
    "growth of the instabilities is initially exponential in time . in electromagnetic plasmas",
    ", growth stops only when the magnetic fields become so large that they have a non - perturbatively large effect on the particle trajectories .",
    "these effects of these large fields can drive isotropization of plasmas that are initially anisotropic @xcite .",
    "this isotropization due to collective plasma phenomena is the basis of our own recent scenario ( with lenaghan ) for the early onset of hydrodynamic behavior in the weak coupling limit @xcite , as compared to estimates based on individual 2-particle collisions . to analyze correctly the effects of plasma instabilities",
    ", however , it is crucial to understand whether the ( chromo-)magnetic fields grow as large in non - abelian gauge theories as in abelian ones . because non - abelian fields interact with each other , there are two possibilities for what might limit their growth .",
    "they might stop growing when ( i ) their effect on typical particles in the plasma becomes non - perturbative , as in the abelian case , or ( ii ) when their interactions with each other become non - perturbative .",
    "the first case occurs when gauge fields @xmath2 and magnetic fields @xmath3 are of order @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the typical momentum of the particles , and @xmath6 is the wavenumber associated with the weibel instability .",
    "the second case corresponds to @xmath7 for weakly - interacting plasmas at times late enough that the particles have diluted to perturbative densities ( number densities small compared to @xmath8 ) , one finds that @xmath9 and so the second scale ( [ eq : bna ] ) is parametrically smaller than the first ( [ eq : ba ] ) .",
    "based on arguments about the form of the magnetic potential energy in anisotropic plasmas , arnold and lenaghan @xcite conjectured that the fields associated with non - abelian plasma instabilities are dynamically driven to line up in color space at the scale ( [ eq : bna ] ) when their self - interactions become important , and that they then grow as approximately abelian configurations to the larger scale ( [ eq : ba ] ) .",
    "they tested this conjecture numerically in a simplified 1 + 1 dimensional toy model of qcd fields in an anisotropic plasma .",
    "subsequently , rebhan , romatschke , and strickland @xcite simulated the full hard - loop effective theory of the problem in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "they indeed found unabated exponential growth beyond the non - abelian scale ( [ eq : bna ] ) , although the abelianization of the fields was not as global as that of the earlier toy model simulations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate , through simulations , whether the full 3 + 1 dimensional theory behaves similarly .",
    "we find significant differences .",
    "we will soon discuss the details of precisely what we simulate , but here we give a preview of our results and conclusions .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] shows the growth of magnetic energy with time for a representative simulation . for comparison",
    ", the dashed line shows a similar 3 + 1 dimensional abelian simulation , and the dotted line a 1 + 1 dimensional non - abelian simulation . in the lower - left shaded region of the plot ,",
    "the fields are perturbative , and all the curves grow at an exponential rate ( as predicted by linearized analysis of the instability ) . for the non - abelian curves ,",
    "a change takes place in the unshaded region , which turns out to roughly correspond to the non - abelian scale ( [ eq : bna ] ) where self - interactions of the fields become important .",
    "the 1 + 1 dimensional non - abelian simulation soon resumes exponential growth .",
    "the 3 + 1 dimensional non - abelian simulation , however , has a different large - time behavior .",

    "these simulations are designed for the sole purpose of cleanly studying what happens as one passes through the non - abelian scale ( [ eq : bna ] ) . for similar reasons ,",
    "the dependence of our results on @xmath18 is determined by trivial scaling arguments : in the effective theory we use , all dependence on @xmath18 can be absorbed by simple rescaling .",
    "the only assumptions are that @xmath18 is small enough , and the separation ( [ eq : separation ] ) of scales significant enough , for the hard - loop effective theory to be valid .",
    "given these assumptions , the numerical results we quote are valid for any @xmath18 .",
    "the primary motivation of studying instabilities in non - abelian plasmas is to help understand what happens in an expanding quark - gluon plasma produced in a heavy - ion collision . in this work , however , we simulate non - expanding systems , both for simplicity and to isolate the particular issue we are studying . ignoring the expansion is a perfectly good approximation in cases where the instability growth rate is large compared to the expansion rate . for example , in the context of the original `` bottom - up '' thermalization scenario of baier _",
