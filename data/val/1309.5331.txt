    "microwave spectroscopy on a solid , i.e.  measuring its frequency - dependent response at ghz frequencies , gives experimental access to the optical properties of a material at comparably low frequencies ( 30  ghz @xmath0 1  @xmath1 @xmath0 124  @xmath2ev @xmath0 1.4  k).@xcite we are interested in the study of conductive bulk materials such as metals or superconductors ; here microwave spectroscopy can reveal low - energy charge dynamics and electronic or magnetic excitations.@xcite these low probing energies correspond to the low temperatures where many of the most interesting effects occur in this context .",
    "therefore , several experimental approaches have been developed to study the microwave properties of metals and superconductors at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "ideally , the technique for such an experiment would have the following properties : broad spectral range ( complete frequency dependence ) , full complex response ( amplitude and phase ) , good sensitivity ( also applicable for low - loss samples ) , and compatibility with cryogenic temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , so far there is no technique available that fulfills all of these options : corbino reflection spectroscopy is applicable in extremely broad frequency ranges ( up to 40 ghz)@xcite and at cryogenic temperatures,@xcite is phase - sensitive , and has been used in the study of conventional and exotic superconductors @xcite , correlated metals,@xcite , and materials close to a transition between conductive and insulating states.@xcite while the corbino approach is applicable for bulk samples of lossy conductors,@xcite its comparably poor sensitivity restricts its applicability for highly conductive metals and superconductors to geometrically strongly confined samples,@xcite such as thin films . since many particularly interesting conducting materials are only available as bulk samples , the corbino approach is not applicable here .",
    "a broadband microwave technique that is sensitive enough to study bulk superconductors well below the critical temperature is the bolometric spectrometer,@xcite but this only measures the amplitude of the microwave absorption , i.e.  it does not give phase information .",
    "an approach that can both be very sensitive and reveal phase information are resonant measurements , where the sample acts as perturbation to a microwave resonator . from measurements of resonance frequency and quality factor ,",
    "one can in principle determine amplitude and phase of the microwave properties of the sample .",
    "another advantage are the rather loose requirements concerning calibration of microwave lines that transmit the signal in the cryogenic environment . amongst the different resonator",
    "techniques,@xcite cavity perturbation has been used for several decades already and probably is the most generically applied microwave technique to study metals and and in particular superconductors at cryogenic temperatures.@xcite however , there are two main disadvantages of cavity measurements : firstly , it is often very difficult to obtain absolute values . secondly , and more fundamental , cavity resonators",
    "are usually operated at a single resonance frequency , and therefore one does not obtain any information on the frequency dependence .",
    "obtaining spectral information from cavity measurements either requires operation of a cavity at different modes or of separate cavities;@xcite in both cases it is difficult to obtain quantitative information . a recent development to use the high sensitivity of a resonator and",
    "simultaneously obtain spectral information is operating a dielectric resonator at different resonance frequencies , and this technique has been applied successfully to the study of bulk superconductors at mk temperatures.@xcite    in our work , we follow a somewhat different experimental approach .",
    "our goal are cryogenic microwave measurements that are sensitive enough for bulk samples of good metals or superconductors , that reveal the frequency dependence , and that are compatible with operation at mk temperatures in a dilution refrigerator .",
    "all these requirements are met by superconducting stripline resonators where the sample acts as one of the ground planes .",
    "superconducting stripline ( also called triplate ) resonators,@xcite as well as the similar microstrip resonators,@xcite have been used since the 1980s to study thin films of superconductors . a related technique",
    "are superconducting coplanar resonators , which have also been used to study the microwave properties of superconducting thin films,@xcite and which recently became very popular for photon detection ( as microwave kinetic inductance detectors)@xcite and in the field of quantum information science ( e.g.  as building blocks for circuit qed architecture).@xcite while coplanar resonators have advantages compared to stripline and microwave resonators in terms of achievable quality factors , scalability , and ease of fabrication , it is difficult to combine them with bulk samples if one is interested in quantitative information about the sample s microwave properties.@xcite    therefore , we employ superconducting stripline resonators.@xcite while previous applications of this technique focused on thin film samples,@xcite diiorio _",
    "et al . _ also demonstrated measurements on a bulk sample of gold as a reference.@xcite starting from these previous works , we have developed stripline resonators for the particular goal of studying bulk samples of highly conductive metals or superconductors . with the high achievable quality factors of these resonators ,",
    "we are sensitive enough to detect the response of such low - loss samples .",
    "furthermore , because these resonators are based on one - dimensional transmission lines , we can easily operate them not only at the fundamental mode , but also at numerous higher harmonics .",
    "thus we obtain data at a set of roughly equidistant frequencies , with typical frequency spacings around 1  ghz .",
    "while this can not compete with the complete frequency dependence accessible with broadband techniques , it is sufficient for many questions in the field of superconductors and correlated metals , where spectral features are usually broad . finally , the compact design of the probe can easily be implemented into a dilution refrigerator , opening a route toward microwave studies on bulk metals and superconductors at temperatures well below 1  k , a temperature range that has rarely been explored for microwave spectroscopy on conducting materials so far.@xcite",

    "for a resonator that is undercoupled to the external circuitry ( @xmath15 ) and comprises of low - loss dielectrics ( @xmath16 ) , the measured quality factor will be solely determined by the losses in the conductors ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "we are currently looking forward to applying these methods for studies of materials that can only be synthesized as bulk samples such as most heavy - fermion materials or unconventional superconductors.@xcite many of these materials display features worth taking a closer look in this frequency and temperature region , making our method a useful tool in an active field of present research .",

    "wheeler gives the approximate impedance for a stripline with infinitely thin center strip and parameters substrate height @xmath30 , zero - thickness strip width @xmath113 , and dielectric permittivity @xmath114 as@xcite @xmath115 for finite strip thickness the equivalent zero - thickness strip width @xmath113 can be evaluated by@xcite @xmath116 ^ 2+\\left[\\frac{1/4\\pi}{w / t+1.10}\\right]^\\frac{6}{3+t / h } } } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the real strip width and @xmath29 the center strip thickness .",
    "+ the calculated values for the two different geometries we used can be found in table [ table : geometry ] .",
    "an estimation of @xmath117 is used for the sapphire permittivity that can lead to small deviations in the values for @xmath31 . however",
    ", this does not affect the resulting values for the surface resistance as the permittivity is canceled out in the expression for the @xmath23-factor .",
    "as derived from the wheeler incremental inductance rule , the @xmath23-factor for a superconducting stripline where the sample substitutes one ground plane is calculated from the characteristic impedance , its derivative in direction of skin layer penetration , and the magnetic constant @xmath118 : @xmath119 in our case the penetration can be seen as an effective increase in substrate height , so the derivative is taken in respect of @xmath30 .",
    "+ for a stripline where all conductors consist of the same material , losses in all their surfaces have to be considered . following the concept of receding surfaces",
    ", this translates to an increase in @xmath30 for both ground planes , as well as a decrease in @xmath28 and @xmath29 from both sides of the center strip . with all these parts considered in the attenuation constant",
    "this leads to a different @xmath23-factor @xmath120 the resulting @xmath23-factor values for each of the two used stripline geometries are also displayed in table [ table : geometry ] .",

    "<S> we present a method to measure the absolute surface resistance of conductive samples at a set of ghz frequencies with superconducting lead stripline resonators at temperatures 1  - 6  k. the stripline structure can easily be applied for bulk samples and allows direct calculation of the surface resistance without the requirement of additional calibration measurements or sample reference points . </S>",
    "<S> we further describe a correction method to reduce experimental background on high - q resonance modes by exploiting tem - properties of the external cabling . </S>",
    "<S> we then show applications of this method to the reference materials gold , tantalum , and tin , which include the anomalous skin effect and conventional superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we extract the complex optical conductivity for an all - lead stripline resonator to find a coherence peak and the superconducting gap of lead </S>",
