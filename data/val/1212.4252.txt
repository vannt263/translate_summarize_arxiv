    "the chemostat was introduced in the fifties as an experimental device to study the microbial growth on a limiting resource @xcite .",
    "it is also often used as a mean to reproduce situations where ( limiting ) nutrients are fed to micro - organisms , typically in a liquid medium , in natural ecosystems @xcite or anthropized environments @xcite .",
    "more generally , the chemostat is largely used as a scientific investigation tool in microbial ecology @xcite .",
    "the mathematical model of the chemostat has been extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) and used as a reference model in microbiology @xcite , microbial ecology @xcite or biotechnological industries such as the waste - water treatment @xcite . more generally , the chemostat serves to describe resource - consumer relations , where the resource is supplied at a constant rate .",
    "however , in many applications , the assumption of perfectly stirred chemostats is , in general , too restrictive . in the eighties , the gradostat , as an experimental device composed of a set of chemostats of identical volume interconnected in series ,",
    "was introduced to represent spatial gradient @xcite , in a marine environment @xcite or to model rhizosphere @xcite .",
    "it motivated several mathematical studies @xcite .",
    "similarly , an interest for series of bioreactors appeared in biochemical industry , with tanks of different volumes to be minimized @xcite . in ecology ,",
    "island models have been proposed since the late sixties @xcite to study the effects of heterogeneous environments with more general patterns than serial ones .",
    "several studies of prey - predator in patchy environments have been conducted since then @xcite .",
    "comparatively , relatively few studies have considered non - serial interconnections for resource - consumer models or chemostats @xcite . in natural reservoirs such as in undergrounds or ground - waters , a spatial structure with interconnections between several volumes",
    "is often considered , each of them being approximated as perfectly mixed tank .",
    "those interconnections can be parallel , series or built up in more complex networks . to our knowledge",
    ", the influence of the topology of a network of chemostats on the overall dynamics has been sparsely investigated in the literature .",
    "however , the simple consideration of two interconnected habitats can lead to non - intuitive behaviors @xcite and influence significantly the overall performances @xcite .",
    "recently , literature in ecology has raised the relevance of `` source - sink '' models for describing plants / nutrients interactions , and predicting ecosystems performances @xcite .",
    "those models are mathematically close to general gradostat models , but with a significant difference concerning the resources compartments , for which the input rate mechanisms ( due to atmospheric depositions or rock alterations ) are assumed to be independent of the nutrient leaching ( and not modeled as a transport term as in hydrology or in chemostat - like models ) .",
    "it is also well - known since the seventies that microbial growth can be inhibited by large concentrations of nutrient .",
    "such inhibition can be modeled by non - monotonic response functions @xcite and lead to initial - condition dependent washout @xcite .",
    "non - monotonic response functions occur in predator - prey models , for instance , when the predation decreases due to the ability of the prey to better defend when their population get larger .",
    "this non - monotonic functional response could also lead to bi - stability and possible extinction of the predator @xcite .",
    "several control strategies of the input flow were proposed in the literature to globally stabilize the chemostat @xcite but the ability of a spatial structure to passively stabilize such dynamics has not been yet studied ( in @xcite a general structure of networks of chemostats is considered but with monotonic growth rates , while in @xcite non - monotonic functions are considered but for the serial gradostat only ) .    the present work considers a particular interconnection of two chemostats of different volumes , one being a buffer tank . to our knowledge , this spatial structure , that is neither serial nor parallel , has not yet been considered in the literature . this structure is analogous to refuges in patchy environments @xcite , but here both consumer and resource are present in each vessel .",
    "we prove that it is possible with such a configuration to obtain repulsive washout equilibrium , while any serial , parallel or single tank structures with the same total volume exhibits multi - stability .",
    "this result brings new insights into the role of spatial patterns in the stability of bio - conversion processes in natural environments , where buffers can occur such as in soil ecosystems .",
    "it has also potential implications for the design of robust industrial bio - processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ hypo ] presents the hypotheses and the buffered configuration , comparing with serial and parallel interconnections .",
    "section [ section3 ] studies the multiplicity of equilibria and their stability for such configurations , considering a general class of response functions ( monotonic as well as non - monotonic ) .",
    "section [ section4 ] discusses the biological and ecological implications of the results of section [ section3 ] in terms of persistence of microbial species in a non - homogeneous environment , along with some industrial perspectives .",
    "numerical simulations illustrate the results on an haldane function in section [ section_example ] .",
    "all the proofs are postponed to the appendix .",
    "we consider the chemostat model with a single strain growing on a single limiting nutrient . the system is fed with nutrient of concentration @xmath0 with flow rate @xmath1 .",
    "the total volume @xmath2 is assumed to be constant ( i.e. input and output flow rates are supposed to be identical ) .",
    "when the concentrations of nutrient ( or substrate ) and biomass , denoted respectively @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are homogeneous , as it is the case in perfectly mixed tanks , the system can be modeled by the well - known differential equations : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the uptake function and @xmath7 the yield coefficient of the transformation of nutrient into biomass . without any loss of generality ,",

    "consider the case for which the washout equilibrium is attracting in the chemostat model ( cases 1 and 2 of proposition [ prop - chemostat ] ) .",
    "furthermore , consider spatial configurations with the same input flow and residence time than the perfectly mixed case , i.e. with the same total volume @xmath2 and input flow @xmath1 .",

    "this lemma shows that when a bacterial species can not persist in a chemostat , from any or a subset of initial conditions , this property persists in at least one vessel of any serial or parallel interconnection of chemostats with the same total volume . in the present work , we study a different kind of spatial configuration with an asymmetry created by two interconnected volumes , one of them serving as a buffer ( see figure [ fig - pocket ] ) .",
