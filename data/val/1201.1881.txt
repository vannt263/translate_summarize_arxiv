    "higher order flow coefficients have recently been recognized as a new observable to gain information about the creation of the quark gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion reactions and its properties @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow , the second order fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of the particles in the final state , has been investigated in detail during the last decade , since it is the crucial observable that is responsible for the proof that the quark gluon plasma is a nearly perfect liquid @xcite .",
    "pressure gradients translate the initial state coordinate space eccentricity to the final state momentum space ellipticity and this connection is affected by the viscosity and the equation of state .",
    "triangular flow and even higher moments of the fourier decomposition have been measured during the last year by various experimental collaborations at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "the higher odd anisotropic flow coefficients require the treatment of event - by - event fluctuations , since they vanish averaged over events .",
    "a lot of recent theoretical development has been aimed towards a better understanding of the correlations between initial and final state .",
    "most of these models work in a simplified framework , using e.g. linearized hydrodynamics or rotated averaged initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the initial state of a heavy ion reaction that is needed to run a ( viscous ) hydrodynamic evolution is usually modeled following a glauber or cgc approach @xcite .",
    "also more realistic initial conditions have been investigated using event generators like nexus , urqmd , etc @xcite .",
    "some people have also studied simplified models like the one - tube model @xcite or just a statistical number of hot spots to get a more systematic handle on understanding initial state structures @xcite .    between all these different approaches",
    "there seems to be agreement , that the flow coefficients can be used to constrain the initial state dynamics and have the potential to sort out different models @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal is to understand the initial energy deposition which has fundamentally to do with the distributions of the nucleons / partons in the incoming nuclei and the interactions they are undergoing .",
    "the systematic study that is presented in this paper constitutes one step on the way to constrain the initial state granularity . by using a hybrid transport approach that is based on the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics including an ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional ideal hydrodynamic expansion ,",
    "we demonstrate that triangular flow is directly related to the amount of fluctuations in the initial state . by using a full event - by - event setup we can calculate the triangular flow via the event plane method as it is measured by the phenix collaboration and",
    "put some first constraints on the initial state granularity .    in section [ hybrid ]",
    "the hybrid model is described and it is explained how different granularities are obtained by initially averaging over different numbers of events .",
    "the following section [ basics ] demonstrates that the chosen setup does not change the bulk properties of the system by looking at pion and kaon transverse mass spectra and elliptic flow in non - central collisions .",
    "after that , we come back ( in section [ en_dist ] ) to the initial state eccentricity and triangularity distributions as a function of granularity leading directly to the resulting anisotropic flow coefficients in section [ vn_data ] . in the end",
    ", we will draw conclusions from the presented results and outline further research .",
    "the initial state profile and its granularity are mainly influenced by the following three things : the shape of the incoming nuclei , the interaction mechanism and the distribution of binary collisions and the degree of thermalization . in our approach",
    "all of these are given by a dynamic transport model , namely ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) @xcite .",
    "the incoming nucleons are sampled according to woods - saxon profiles and the initial nucleon - nucleon scatterings and non - equilibrium dynamics proceed according to the boltzmann equation . after the two nuclei have passed through each other , at @xmath0 fm , local thermal equilibrium is assumed to perform the transition to the ideal hydrodynamic description .",
    "the particle degrees of freedom are represented by three - dimensional gaussian distributions in the following way @xmath1 to obtain energy , momentum and net baryon density distributions that are smooth enough for the hydrodynamic evolution . here , @xmath2 is the energy density at position @xmath3 that a particle with energy @xmath4 at position @xmath5 contributes .",
    "the gaussians are lorentz contracted in z - direction by @xmath6 to account for the large longitudinal velocities . only the matter at midrapidity @xmath7",
    "is assumed to be locally equilibrated , whereas the other hadrons are treated in the hadronic cascade .",
    "a similar procedure is often employed in monte carlo approaches for hydrodynamic initial conditions .",
    "the width of the gaussians representing the individual particles or tubes that lead to hot spots in the initial state is then varied and the granularity changes .",
    "the disadvantage of adjusting this parameter is that the overall features of the initial state change as well , e.g. the entropy density or the maximum value of the profile and need to be re - adjusted . in @xcite",
    "we have shown how bulk observables are affected by variations of the obvious initial state parameters , the starting time and the gaussian width .",
    "for the present systematic study we have chosen a different path : by averaging over different numbers ( @xmath8 - @xmath9 ) of initial events at the same beam energy , impact parameter and collision system , the bulk properties of the system are kept constant , while the granularity is varied .",
    "the disadvantage of the averaging procedure is that the direct connection to the initial state physics is lost .",
