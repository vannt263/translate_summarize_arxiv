    "a remarkable aspect of one - dimensional interacting electron systems ( we will use one - dimensional electrons as a concrete example throughout the paper , but our results immediately generalize to any system with an internal  spin \" degree of freedom , _ e.g. _ cold atomic gases ) is that a perturbative treatment of the interactions about the non - interacting limit , and thus fermi liquid theory , fails .",
    "this is a consequence of the pervasive nesting taking place at all densities and polarizations , due to the simple fact that the fermi surface reduces to two fermi points .",
    "the central result to emerge in one dimension is that , for many realistic parameters , the low - energy physics is gapless and described by a universal low - energy theory called ",
    "luttinger liquid \" ( ll ) theory.@xcite according to ll theory , there are no electron - like quasi - particles analogous to those found in fermi liquid theory ( which describes interacting electrons in three dimensions ) . instead , the low energy physics is dominated by bosonic collective excitations .",
    "ll theory also states that for finite interactions there will be a spin - charge separation with distinct collective spin and charge excitations that each have their own characteristic velocity and hamiltonian .",
    "the spectral properties of the ll are very different from a fermi liquid , but have been computed and are known.@xcite    a particularly good realization ( low disorder ) of one - dimensional electrons is found in high mobility semiconductor heterostructures of the type often used to study the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "related systems were used recently to establish the presence of ll physics in quantum wires.@xcite while previous carbon nanotube experiments @xcite demonstrating a power - law form of the tunneling density of states were correctly interpreted as an indication of ll behavior , they did not unambiguously establish its existence because they did not probe the full spectral function of the system due to the local tunneling of electrons ( which does not allow momentum resolution ) .",
    "the key feature of the semiconductor heterostructure devices is that parallel wires can be fabricated and momentum - resolved tunneling experiments performed .",
    "it is the momentum resolution that allowed the dynamical properties of the wires to be measured and ll behavior to be unambiguously observed.@xcite    however , these experiments also showed a distinct set of behaviors when the temperature was estimated to be of the order or much larger than the characteristic spin energy.@xcite in this regime , ll theory is not expected to hold , but rather a separate theory describing  spin - incoherent \" electrons takes over .",
    "@xcite it turns out this  spin - incoherent luttinger liquid \" ( sill ) has many _ more _ universal properties than the ll , @xcite but its conclusive demonstration in experiment is not yet universally agreed upon.@xcite part of the challenge is that for realistic parameters many one - dimensional systems fall in the crossover regime between ll and sill , greatly complicating the interpretation of the experiments.@xcite this crossover regime is not easily or accurately handled by existing analytical methods , so a numerical approach is required .    in this work ,",
    "we describe a technique well suited to this challenge and compute several quantities that can be directly compared to experiment . the qualitative agreement with existing experiments in ref .",
    "[ ] provides further evidence that the spin - incoherent regime has indeed been reached . at present , there are no other numerical methods that have been demonstrated to accurately access the parameter regimes and system sizes we study here .",
    "a strength of our density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)-based calculation is that it free of the artifacts introduced by statistical sampling , such as in quantum monte carlo .",
    "our calculations start deep within the spin - incoherent regime and approach the crossover regime  from above \"",
    "( i.e. from temperatures above than the crossover temperature ) , complementing existing analytical methods that attempt to approach the crossover regime  from below \" using ll theory .",
    "most importantly , the method accurately captures the crossover regime allowing its properties to be revealed .",
    "such information can be crucial in the proper interpretation of experiments in the strongly interacting regime ( which are always at finite temperature ) and can be used as an aid in the development of approximate analytical methods to describe this regime .",
    "to be concrete , we study the one - dimensional hubbard model : @xmath3 where @xmath4 creates an electron of spin @xmath5 on the @xmath6 site along a chain of length @xmath7 .",
    "the hopping parameter of the hubbard chain is @xmath8 , the onsite interaction energy is @xmath9 , and we take the inter - atomic distance as unity . in the limit of large repulsive @xmath9",
    ", we can equivalently consider the @xmath0 model , defined as @xmath10 where the constraint forbidding double - occupancy has been imposed .",
    "the natural excitations of this model are charge and spin collective modes ( holons and spinons , respectively ) with different velocities that depend on the ratio @xmath11 , or @xmath1 . in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 limit",
    ", the ground state factorizes into the product of a fermionic wave function @xmath14 , and a spin wave function @xmath15 @xcite @xmath16 the first piece , @xmath14 , describes the charge degrees of freedom , and is simply the ground state of a spinless non - interacting tight - binding hamiltonian . at finite @xmath9 ,",
    "the spins are governed by a heisenberg interaction @xmath17 where @xmath18 depends on the charge wave - function and is proportional to @xmath19.@xcite in the @xmath12 , @xmath20 limit , the spin states are degenerate and the dispersion is just a non - interacting band @xmath21 , but any finite interaction will lift this degeneracy and give the spin degree of freedom some dispersion . the factorized wavefunction approach has been used in a number of key earlier studies@xcite in the strongly interacting regime , but _",
    "we do not make such an approximation here_.    in fig.[fig1 ] we show the momentum resolved spectrum of a chain with @xmath22 sites and @xmath23 particles , for values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( all quantities are in units of the hopping ) , obtained with time - dependent dmrg at zero temperature.@xcite the spectrum is clearly gapless , displaying a weakly dispersive spinon band of width @xmath26 , and broad holon bands of width @xmath27 .",
    "our results agree in the @xmath28 limit with the dispersion calculated in refs .",
    "[ ] using the factorized wave function , eq . ( [ gs ] ) , and also with the exact diagonalization results for the @xmath0 model in ref . [ ] , at the same density and similar value of parameters . for small values of @xmath18",
    "we see an almost non - dispersive spinon band . in this case , a spin - incoherent behavior would be observed at a finite temperature larger than the characteristic spin energy scale , but much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath29 .",
    "when these conditions are realized , the spins are totally incoherent , effectively at infinite temperature , while the charge sector remains very close to the ground state .",
    "the key idea behind our calculation is thermo field dynamics.@xcite this construction allows one to represent a mixed state of a quantum system as a pure state in an enlarged hilbert space .",
    "consider the energy eigenstates of the system in question @xmath30 , described by a hamiltonian @xmath31 , and introduce an auxiliary set of fictitious states @xmath32 in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath30 .",
    "we can then define the unnormalized pure quantum state , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a copy of @xmath35 in the auxiliary hilbert space , @xmath36 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath37 is our thermal vacuum",
    ". then the exact thermodynamic average of an operator @xmath38 ( acting only on the real states ) , is given by @xmath39 where the partition function is the norm of the thermal state @xmath40 .",
    "we can clearly see how the calculation of a thermodynamic average reduces to calculating a conventional expectation value of an operator in a pure quantum state , at the price of working in a larger hilbert space .    at @xmath41 ,",
    "the state @xmath42 is the maximally entangled state between the real system and the fictitious system .",
    "we can see that this is independent of the representation , and we can choose any arbitrary basis .",
    "in particular , is natural to work in an occupation number representation where the state of each site @xmath43 takes on a definite value @xmath44 .",
    "one finds @xmath45 of site @xmath43 with its `` ancilla '' , the local degree of freedom in the auxiliary system . at this point it becomes convenient to perform a time - reversal transformation on the ancillas .",
    "therefore , for the case that concerns us , where double - occupancy is forbidden , this state can be written as @xmath46 .",
    "this simple step allows us to work in a basis where the total spin projection @xmath47 of the chain - ancilla system is effectively zero.@xcite we emphasize that both spin and charge degrees of freedom appear in @xmath48 , and are therefore treated on equal footing as regards finite - temperature effects .",
    "( subject , of course , to the no double occupancy constraint . )    the state of the system at an arbitrary temperature @xmath49 is obtained by evolving the maximally mixed state in imaginary time , eq .",
    "( [ thermoa ] ) with @xmath41 , using the hamiltonian acting on the real degrees of freedom .",
    "the ancillas do not have any interactions controlling their dynamics .",
    "they evolve only by their entanglement with the physical spins , effectively acting as a thermal bath .",
    "this is the basis of the finite - temperature dmrg method.@xcite notice that at zero temperature , the site and the ancilla are totally disentangled , while at finite temperature there is always a finite degree of entanglement that only depends on the dynamics of the system .    an important consequence of the previous description is that it would correspond to working in the grand canonical ensemble : even though the spin and charge quantum numbers are conserved for the enlarged system , this is not the case if we restrict ourselves to the physical chain . in order to work in the canonical ensemble we need to start from a thermal vacuum where the physical states @xmath50 and their copies @xmath51 have each a fixed number of particles . to achieve that",
    ", we are going to construct a state that is a sum of all possible states of charge and spin , with the constraint that the total number of particles on the chain has to be equal to @xmath52 , and that the charge state of the ancillas is an exact copy of the charge state of the physical chain .",
    "we achieve this by calculating the ground state of a very peculiar hamiltonian , using conventional dmrg : @xmath53 the operator @xmath54(@xmath55 ) creates ( annihilates ) a singlet between the physical spin and the ancilla , @xmath56 where the `` tilde '' operators act on the ancillas on site @xmath43 .",
    "the ground state of this hamiltonian is precisely the equal superposition of all the configurations of @xmath52 `` physical site - ancilla '' singlets on @xmath7 sites .",
    "this state can be represented very efficiently in terms of a matrix - product state , and consequently , by the dmrg method . in practice ,",
    "the number of dmrg states required is of the order of the number of particles .",
    "we find the use of the `` entangler '' hamiltonian practical and convenient .",
    "note that it does not disrupt the su(2 ) symmetry of the @xmath0 model .",
    "we study the spectral properties of a spin - incoherent chain by evaluating the green s functions at time @xmath8 at finite spin temperature : @xmath57 where the generic operators of interest @xmath58,@xmath59 act on the system at site @xmath60 , and the hamiltonian @xmath61 governs the physics of the actual physical chain , not including the ancillas .",
    "we use a similar method to the one described in ref . [ ] .",
    "the calculation proceeds as follows : first , we evolve the maximally entangled state in imaginary time to the desired value of @xmath49 measured in units of @xmath62 , _ e.g. _ @xmath63 means @xmath64 .",
    "then , an operator @xmath65 is applied in the center of the chain .",
    "the resulting state is evolved in real - time , and at every step we measure the overlap with the state @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain the desired green s function in frequency and momentum by fourier transforming the results in real space and time . both states , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , have to be evolved in real time .",
    "in this work we use a third order suzuki - trotter decomposition with a typical time - step @xmath69 , both for the real - time and imaginary - time parts of the simulation , keeping 800 states , enough to maintain the truncation error below @xmath70 . as customary in most dmrg calculations , we used open boundary conditions , and by doing the fourier transform we are assuming that boundary effects can be ignored , as though the system were translational invariant . in order to minimize the finite - size effects induced by the boundaries @xcite we evolve to times @xmath71 , and fourier transform to frequency using a gaussian window or width @xmath72 in the time domain , which in turn leads to a mode getting an artificial broadening in frequency proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "we point out that we have not used the linear prediction method introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] , but the bare data obtained from the simulation . at zero temperature we have found that this works well , reproducing the features observed in the bethe ansatz solution of the hubbard chain ( compare our fig.2(c ) to fig.7 in ref . [ ] ) , namely , the singularity at @xmath74 ( seen at @xmath75 ) . at finite temperatures the system develops a finite correlation length , which is further enhanced at higher temperatures due to the spin - incoherent mechanism  to be discussed below .",
    "this is reflected in a localization that makes the boundary effects irrelevant .",
    "working with open boundary conditions also avoids the degeneracy occurring in systems with periodic boundary conditions and size @xmath76 , with @xmath35 being an integer.@xcite the numerical errors can be attributed to the accumulation of truncation error , and the trotter decomposition .",
    "the latter are under control , while the truncation error would translate into error bars that are much smaller than the broadening in frequency , and are therefore ignored for visualization purposes .",
    "in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we show some characteristic physical quantities at finite temperature , such as the specific heat @xmath77 , spin structure factor @xmath78 , and momentum distribution function @xmath79 , for a chain with @xmath80 sites and @xmath81 fermions ( 3/8-filling ) .",
    "all results correspond to a value of @xmath25 .",
    "the correlation functions are defined as : @xmath82 @xmath83 the specific heat in fig.[fig2 ] shows a clear peak at a value of the temperature @xmath84 , signaling the onset of the spin - incoherent regime where the spin degrees of freedom are highly thermalized . at larger temperatures ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are saturated , but a broad peak associated with the charge degrees of freedom is apparent .",
    "the spin structure factor in fig.[fig3](a ) shows a peak at momentum @xmath85 that develops precisely at low temperatures @xmath86 .",
    "the zero temperature result is consistent with that computed in ref .",
    "[ ] . the momentum distribution in fig.[fig3](b , c ) displays the expected luttinger liquid profile , with no discontinuities at the fermi point . below this value of the temperature we also notice the onset of a singularity at @xmath87 in the momentum distribution.@xcite this singularity corresponds to the transfer of spectral weight to the shadow bands , that originate from the scattering with the spin fluctuations that diverge at @xmath85.@xcite while this behavior had already been seen in finite - temperature calculations using the factorized wave function ( [ gs ] ) in ref .",
    "[ ] , our calculations do not rely on the factorized wavefunction , or the xy approximation in the spin sector ( rather than full heisenberg symmetry ) . moreover , they can be readily generalized to a number of other spin symmetries , including the incorporation of spin - orbit effects .",
    "we approximated the _ temperature - dependent _ fermi momentum @xmath88 by taking the inflection point where @xmath79 changes curvature , and plotted the result in fig.[fig3](c ) .",
    "the fermi momentum moves continuously from the zero - temperature value @xmath89 to @xmath90 , with the crossover region centered around @xmath84 , as expected.@xcite we actually observe a saturation value below @xmath90 , but this is an artifact of taking the non - rigorous definition of @xmath91 as the inflection point in @xmath79 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath79 for the hubbard or @xmath0 models changes its form qualitatively for fillings larger than 1/4 , but less than 1/2.@xcite    the  special \" value of 1/4 filling in the lattice models ( as opposed to the effectively low - energy theories ) is related to the underlying hubbard model , and the qualitative change for fillings above it and below it can be understood in the following way : the shadow bands carry a significant ammount of spectral weight above @xmath92 .",
    "when the density is larger than quarter - filling , the shadow band covers all @xmath93-space from 0 to @xmath94 .",
    "this translates into and increase of weight above @xmath91 .",
    "( recall that @xmath79 is the integrated weight for @xmath95.@xcite )    one further feature of @xmath79 is particularly striking : the values @xmath96 and @xmath97 are temperature independent within the accuracy of our calculation , with @xmath98 and @xmath90 twice @xmath91 , rather than the value obtained by the inflection point of @xmath79 .",
    "the same behavior was also observed in the factorized wavefunction approach with xy symmetry described in ref .",
    "[ ] . evidently , then",
    ", it is independent of the spin symmetry , and probably results from an _ effective _ temperature independence of the charge sector ( temperature is taken to be precisely zero with respect to the charge sector in ref . [ ] ) .",
    "since both calculations are effectively in the large @xmath9 limit , it may be that the temperature independence of these two points can be attributed to two extreme  charge configurations \"",
    "one  evenly spaced `` and one ' ' maximally paired \" ( two sitting right next to each other ) . in the density - density correlations , the former would correspond to @xmath99 oscillations and the latter to @xmath90 oscillations . in the large @xmath9 limit , it must be that these are both extreme  spin - independent \" configurations in the sense that  evenly spaced \" electrons or  maximally paired \" paired electrons have only minimal contributions from the spin energy , leading to the temperature independence of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "qualitatively , the shift from @xmath91 to @xmath90 ( as measured by the inflection point of @xmath79 ) when the spin - incoherent regime is obtained can be understood as a shift from particles with spin dynamics to particles that are effectively spinless.@xcite in the large but finite @xmath9 limit of the hubbard model , electrons at zero temperature  dimerize \" ever so slightly and in this way maintain a  memory \" of their non - interacting @xmath91 .",
    "however , once @xmath2 , this dimerization is washed out ( because the energy scale for dimerization is set by @xmath18 ) and effectively shifts @xmath91 to its  spinless \" value , @xmath90.@xcite    fig.[fig4 ] shows the momentum resolved photoemission spectrum obtained by taking @xmath100 in eq.([gf ] ) in the previous treatment . at infinite temperature ,",
    "it resembles a band of non - interacting spinless fermions , following a @xmath101 dispersion with a  width \" much larger than seen in a zero temperature calculation ( _ e.g. _ , the result in fig.[fig1 ] for a larger system size ) .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , and @xmath49 increased , we see spectral weight being transfered from positive to negative energies . at the same time , the band appears to broaden in the momentum direction , also splitting into seemingly discrete weakly dispersive levels . at a value of @xmath102 ,",
    "the strongest features of the dispersion describe a number of discrete levels on top of a band that follows the spinless dispersion , with very small weight above the fermi level .",
    "the high weight at zero momentum corresponds to the high density of states in the van hove singularity of the spinless band . at temperatures below @xmath103 ,",
    "the dispersion splits into two  echoes \" , centered at @xmath104 , showing the emergence of the shadow bands and features more reminiscent of a ll .",
    "we have verified that the gap between the horizontal levels are a finite - size effect , and the spacing grows as @xmath105 as we reduce the system size .",
    "the two - peaked features for @xmath106 in the horizontal dispersion correspond to scattering of charge states with the non - dispersive spins present in the spin - incoherent regime .    many of these features can be qualitatively understood within sill theory .",
    "first imagine a system at zero temperature with @xmath107 . at the fillings we consider ,",
    "this system will behave as a ll because it is gapless .",
    "the spectral function will exhibit cusp - like singularities at @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the spin velocity and @xmath111 is the charge velocity .",
    "@xcite since @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the  sharpness \" of the cusps are determined by the interaction parameters of the ll theory in the spin and charge sectors.@xcite if one now adds a small finite temperature ( so as to remain in the ll regime ) the ll correlation functions obtain a finite correlation length @xmath114 .",
    "this correlation length will smear and broaden the cusp - like singularities .",
    "as the temperature is further raised , there is a smallest correlation length than can be obtained : the interparticle spacing . in the spin - incoherent regime ,",
    "@xmath115 effectively saturates at this value and leads to a universal broadening@xcite of @xmath116 of the singularity associated with the charge mode and a vanishing of the singularity associated with the spin mode .",
    "this effect is evident in fig.[fig4 ] for @xmath117 when one compares to the zero temperature result in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "for @xmath118 the shadow bands are beginning to emerge and the spin degrees of freedom are starting to become dynamical leading to a complicated spectral form .    finally , we focus on the crossover regime at @xmath119 . the spectrum is shown with clarity in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "these results can be compared to experiments in nanowires.@xcite ( see _ e.g. _ , their fig.3 . )",
    "the qualitative agreement indicates that the experiments were most likely in the regime of highly thermalized spin states .",
    "moreover , our calculations conclusively demonstrate that disorder effects need not be invoked to explain the data.@xcite these results can also be compared to high - energy angle - resolved photoemission experiments on quasi one - dimensional srcuo@xmath120 , where the v - shaped dispersion is also observed.@xcite",
    "we have presented a numerical study of the spectral properties of @xmath0 chains at finite temperature , using a generalization of time - dependent dmrg techniques that combines evolution in real and imaginary time .",
    "the study of finite temperature effects on the spectral functions of one - dimensional systems using quantum monte carlo techniques @xcite has mostly focused on the interpretation of photoemission experiments on quasi one - dimensional compounds such as srcuo@xmath120@xcite and ttf - tcnq.@xcite while the monte carlo technique is free of the sign problem in one - dimension , the calculation of spectral properties involves an analytic continuation from matsubara frequencies which is not straightforward in the spin - incoherent regime .",
    "the application of a maximum entropy method to the results is affected by statistical uncertainties , inherent from the stochastic qmc approach . on the other hand ,",
    "our method is naturally applied to study the spin - incoherent regime and we have demonstrated it is quantitatively accurate by comparison with bethe ansatz results in various limits .",
    "we have clearly seen that at temperatures of the order of @xmath84 , the system experiences a crossover from a spin - coherent to a spin - incoherent regime , which is clearly manifest in the spectra .",
    "our results in finite systems show a compelling qualitative agreement with experiments in nanowires.@xcite the fact that our systems have a finite size works to our advantage since our parameters are similar to the experimental conditions , which involve wires at low densities with few electrons .    in summary",
    ", we have been able to address an important and analytically inaccessible regime of strongly correlated one - dimensional systems .",
    "the time - dependent dmrg method has the power to access the full crossover from sill to ll behavior as a function of temperature and therefore is a powerful tool in the interpretation of experimental results , and as a guide to analytical approximations not yet developed",
