    "a comparison between the 2007 and 2008 images show a similar overall morphology , but the lobes in the former appears to be more extended in r.a .  and have slightly different orientations than those in the latter .",
    "there is also additional emission in 2007 to the south between the two lobes , which is not observed in 2008 .",
    "we believe that these discrepancies are mostly due to artifacts in the image reconstruction , as a result of sparse @xmath4-@xmath5  sampling of the data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , we argue that the two main lobes are physical , because they are present in both observations which have different hour angle coverage . the total cleaned flux density in the 2007 and 2008 images are 120 and 50mjy , respectively , much lower than the values 350 and 410mjy obtained from atca monitoring at a similar frequency in the same time period @xcite . with a minimum baseline of @xmath18300k@xmath7 ,",
    "the vlbi observations are insensitive to features larger than @xmath19 .",
    "hence , our result indicates that the majority of the remnant flux density is contributed by smooth diffuse emission of at least a comparable scale , implying a substantial thickness of the radio shell .    in figure  [ img]b the 2008 vlbi image",
    "is compared to lower resolution atca images at 9 and 36ghz taken at similar epochs ( 2008 october ) @xcite . since all these observations",
    "are phase - referenced to the same nearby calibrator , we estimate that the astrometric accuracy should be @xmath20mas and therefore did not perform any manual alignment .",
    "the lobes found in the vlbi images closely match the brightest part of the shell at 9 and 36ghz .",
    "however , regions of lower brightness temperature tracing the remainder of the remnant , seen in the latter two images , are not detected in the vlbi observations .",
    "this is likely because the large - scale diffuse emission is resolved out in the vlbi images , and any compact features ( see  [ compact ] below ) fall below the detection sensitivity .",
    "figure  [ img]b also presents a comparison of the vlbi result to h@xmath21 and x - ray images obtained from the _ hst _ and the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ on 2007 may and 2008 april , respectively ( j.c.s .",

    "these images were fitted to a simple torus to determine the remnant center , then aligned with the vlbi image using the supernova position reported by @xcite .",
    "there appears to be no detailed correlation of the brightness distribution at small scales in the radio , optical and x - ray bands .",
    "moreover , the images indicate that the radio shell has a comparable size to the optical inner ring and the x - ray shell .",
    "the latter result is consistent with the findings by @xcite .      to quantify the remnant geometry",
    ", we employed the fourier modeling technique described by @xcite to fit the vlbi visibility data with a truncated - shell model tilted at 434 to the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "the model parameters include the center position , flux , mean shell radius ( averaged between the inner and outer shells ) , half - opening angle , shell thickness , and a linear gradient in the surface emissivity that accounts for the observed asymmetry ( see figure  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed definition of all these parameters , ) .",
    "given the limited @xmath4-@xmath5  coverage of the data , we fixed the gradient using the 9ghz results @xcite in order to improve the fit stability .",
    "the level of gradient is fixed at 36% ( ratio between the surface brightness at the edge and at the center ) with a position angle at 109  ( measured from the observer s line - of - sight projected on the shell s equatorial plane ) .",
    "all other parameters , including position , flux , radius , half - opening angle and thickness , are free to vary in the fit .",
    "the @xmath22 values are calculated by weighting the fit residuals with the measurement uncertainties of each data point , which are estimated from the scatter of the visibility amplitudes among the four channels , because information on individual measurement errors were not available .",
    "table  [ table ] summarizes the main results : the best - fit models have radii 082 and 084 in 2007 and 2008 , respectively , half - opening angle @xmath23 and thickness @xmath24 of the radius .",
    "we note that the measured thickness should be considered only as a lower limit , since the data are insensitive to large - scale structure .",
    "the small reduced @xmath22 values suggest that the measurement uncertainties are likely overestimated . to determine the confidence intervals of the best - fit parameters , we scaled the uncertainties such that the reduced @xmath25 , and found very small formal statistical errors .",
    "this implies that the systematic errors dominate , which could be introduced by calibration errors or by the weighting scheme of the fits .",
    "while the former is difficult to estimate , we attempted to quantify the latter with simple least - square fits ( i.e.  without weighting ) .",
    "the difference in the model parameters give the uncertainties reported in table  [ table ] .",
    "based on the best - fit model parameters for 2008 , we simulated a visibility data set using the @xmath4-@xmath5  sampling of the 2008 vlbi data .",
    "the simulated data were then imaged and deconvolved identically as the real observations , and the resulting image is shown in figure  [ sim]a .",
    "the truncated - shell model successfully captures the overall shell morphology , but fails to reproduce the double - peak feature of the eastern lobe .",
    "a direct comparison between the best - fit parameters in 2007 and 2008 indicates no significant change in the shell s geometry .",
    "the difference in radius gives an expansion velocity of @xmath26kms@xmath2 , consistent with the result from @xcite , within the sizeable error due to the relatively short time period between the observations .",
    "the vlbi images show no obvious point source at the remnant center , and the 2008 vlbi image gives a 3@xmath0 upper limit of 0.3mjy  on the flux density of any possible central object , such as a radio pulsar or pulsar wind nebula at 1.7ghz .    as listed in table  [ table ] , the best - fit radii are significantly smaller than the value 089 obtained from the atca 9ghz observations in 2008 @xcite . to determine if the discrepancy could be caused by the limited @xmath4-@xmath5  coverage of the vlbi data , we simulated an image with the best - fit truncated - shell model of the 9ghz data , and using the 2008 vlbi observations @xmath4-@xmath5  coverage .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ sim]b , clearly indicating a larger shell size than observed .",
    "this suggests that if the 9ghz model were the correct description of the remnant geometry , then the vlbi observations should be able to recover the geometric parameters .",
    "we compare in figure  [ radius]a the mean shell radius obtained from fourier modeling of different radio observations @xcite , and found that the best - fit radius appears to be largest at 9ghz and smallest at 1.4ghz , while the sizes at 18 and 36ghz are in between .",
    "discrepancy in shell radius at different frequencies has been claimed for the radio remnant of sn  1993j , with a progressively smaller radius at 5ghz than at 1.6ghz since day 1500 @xcite .",
    "a few possible explanations have been proposed , including difference in electron synchrotron lifetimes , a radially increasing magnetic field , or frequency - dependent changes in the opacity of the medium @xcite . for our case of",
    "sn  1987a , the non - monotonic change of the mean shell radius with frequency presents a more complex picture , suggesting that the above physical explanations may not apply . in figure",
    "[ radius]b we plot the deviation of radius from a linear fit to the 9ghz radius after day 4000 against the theoretical ( i.e.   diffraction - limited ) angular resolution . we found a trend of decreasing radius as the beam size gets smaller , independent of the observing frequency .",
    "we have examined whether biases in our fitting technique may give rise to such a result , but as the fits are carried out in the fourier domain rather than the image domain , our procedure is relatively immune to this .",
    "therefore , we suggest that measurements at higher spatial resolutions are biased by unmodeled components in the radio emission , likely to be bright knots near the shell s inner surface .    to test this idea , we tried applying the fourier modeling to the 18 and 36ghz atca data , but restricted on the @xmath4-@xmath5   range @xmath27 , corresponding to the same coverage as the 9ghz atca observations . in all cases , this results in a @xmath28% increase in the best - fit radii when compared to fits on the full dataset , giving values closer to the 9ghz results , thus , providing further support to the picture above . as a final check",
    ", we simulated visibility data based on a toy model of a truncated shell plus few point sources .",
    "the shell has a radius of 09 and 10% thickness , and we added four point sources , two at each side , at a distance 08 from the center and with a total flux density of 15% of the remnant .",
    "based on this toy model , we simulated two visibility data sets using the @xmath4-@xmath5  sampling of the 2008 vlbi and atca 9ghz observations , then applied the fourier modeling as in the real observations .",
    "this gives radii of 085 and 088 for the two simulated data sets , respectively , confirming that our radius measurements made with a truncated shell could be biased by compact features in the remnant , especially at high spatial resolution .",
    "this result is consistent with previous findings @xcite , in which the radius is always smaller when fitted with a single shell than with a shell plus point sources .",
    "we note that although previous results at 9ghz based on fourier modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are likely biased too , our simulations suggest that this is at a much lower level than the vlbi case . also , the bias is systematic , therefore , it should have a minimal effect on the expansion rate measurements .",
    "results from the fourier modeling above present evidence of small - scale features in the radio remnant of sn  1987a . as hinted by the double - peak structure of the radio lobes seen in figure  [ img]a , these features likely consist of discrete clumps near the inner surface of the shell . to constrain their flux density and spatial extent",
    ", we assume an extreme case that all diffuse emission is resolved in the vlbi observations , such that the structure seen in the images represents only the compact emission . we fitted the 2008 vlbi visibility data with a simple model of four gaussian blobs , two at each lobe , and found that the clumps have size smaller than @xmath29 , with a distance 078 - 083 from the remnant center , and a total flux density @xmath3050mjy .",
    "the size limit is only marginally larger than the restoring beam , and converts to a physical extent @xmath31 cm ( @xmath32pc ) at the distance 51.4kpc .",
    "this is comparable to the scale @xmath33 cm of the optical hot spots , for which hydrodynamic simulations suggest a physical size of @xmath34 cm , too small to be resolved by the _",
    "hst _ @xcite .",
    "while it is tempting to associate the radio clumps with the optical hot spots , which are dense gas protruding inward from the inner ring , figure  [ img]b shows no correlation between the radio and optical brightness distribution .",
    "also , the first optical hot spot emerged in the northeast with a position angle 29  ( see inset of figure  [ img]b ; * ? ? ? * ) , significantly offset from the radio peak .",
    "alternatively , the compact radio emission could indicate sites of enhanced cosmic ray acceleration , either with magnetic field amplification or with a local field orientation parallel to the shock normal .",
    "hence , tracing the evolution of the clumps in future observations may give direct constraints on the acceleration time scale and the magnetic field strength ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we present a detailed study of vlbi observations of sn  1987a taken in 2007 and 2008 at 1.4 and 1.7ghz , respectively .",
    "this gives the first vlbi detection of the radio remnant , revealing extended lobes that are consistent with the overall shell morphology in previous radio studies .",
    "we found that the fourier modeling made with a simple truncated shell gives a smaller mean shell radius for the vlbi data than for other radio observations at lower spatial resolutions .",
    "this suggest small - scale features in the radio emission that are not captured by the smooth model .",
    "these features are likely to be discrete clumps near the shell s inner surface .",
    "we obtain a limit of 02 on their spatial scales , with a flux density limit 50mjy , corresponding to @xmath35 of that of the remnant .    although only part of the shell is detected in our vlbi observations , this study demonstrated vlbi imaging as a powerful tool to trace the fine structure of the radio emission .",
    "further observations utilizing the full capability of the lba , including more antennas and wider bandwidth , will offer images with better sensitivity and resolution .",
    "in addition , the on - going interaction between the supernova blast wave and the dense csm has induced a rapid brightening of the remnant .",
    "altogether , we expect future vlbi images to reveal more clumps around the shell , and potentially their substructure .",
    "the new observations will also provide a direct measurement of the remnant s expansion rate , tracing the shock evolution in the csm .",
    "finally , we note that if in future the clumps start to dominate the remnant flux , this will have a significant impact on the fourier modeling of the radio data .",
    "in particular , the east - west asymmetry of the shell could depend sensitively on the brightness of individual clumps , as a result , the simple linear gradient approximation used by @xcite may no longer hold .",
