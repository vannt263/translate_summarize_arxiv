    "the study of exoplanetary systems is arguably the most rapidly developing field in modern astrophysics .",
    "surprisingly , much progress has been made without directly imaging a single planet : radial velocity / microlensing and primary and secondary planet eclipses provide limited , but valuable insights .",
    "direct imaging of planetary systems will have a fundamental impact on the field  a single , low ",
    "resolution 35 @xmath4 m spectrum of a planet may carry more information than all existing spitzer transit photometry combined . as was the case in the search for the first brown dwarf , or for radial velocity and planet transit techniques , achieving the first firm detection is a very difficult and often frustrating challenge .",
    "but these investments paid off rapidly by opening whole new classes of objects for study .",
    "using rotational subtraction of the persistent speckle pattern and the image artifacts , adaptive optics systems are capable of reaching very high contrast .",
    "low thermal  background telescopes , such as very large telescope ( vlt ) and the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) , can utilize this technique in the l  band where the superior adaptive optics  correction ( strehl ratios 80%90% vs. 3045% in h  band ) further increases the contrast .",
    "our recent vlt / naco l  band observations routinely achieved @xmath5l=11 mag contrast at 1 \" and larger separations .",
    "this contrast , in combination with the typical color of older planets ( h@xmath6l=5.5 mag , 2 gyr , 5 m@xmath7 , @xcite ) , provides more than 1  mag sensitivity increase over spectral differential imaging @xcite .",
    "using the l  band angular differential imaging technique on the vlt / naco we carried out a survey of 21 young stars , members of the nearby tucana  horologium ( 1030 myr ) and the @xmath0 pictoris moving groups ( @xmath812 myr ) .",
    "no substellar companions were found around the target stars , but the companion to 51 eri , gj 3305 , was found to be a very close binary on an eccentric orbit .",
    "our sensitivity would have allowed the detection of companions as small as a jupiter mass at orbital distances typically of 5 au .",
    "the absence of detected companions sets constraints on the frequency and maximum orbital distance of giant exoplanets .",
    "we show that a radial distribution of planetary companion with a maximum orbital radius exceeding 30 au  in combination with a power  law index of 0.2  can be rejected at a 90% confidence level ( see , fig . 1 and @xcite ) .",
    "this demonstrates that giant planets are relatively rare at large separations .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached subsequently by other independent surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the result of our naco survey also offers an explanation of why most current and past direct imaging surveys failed to detect a giant planet population : most of these focus on near  infrared wavelengths ( 12.2 @xmath4 m ) , representing a trade  off between the rise of the thermal background toward the longer wavelengths and the adaptive optics performance degrading toward the shorter wavelengths .",
    "_ however , the fact that the 12.2 @xmath4 m flux of giant planets rapidly declines with time limits the age of the ideal target stars to less then 3050 myr . _",
    "because young stars are typically at 40 pc or beyond , even the highest - order adaptive optics - based systems can only probe the outskirts ( @xmath91 \" or @xmath940 au ) of these exoplanetary systems , where giant planets are rare @xcite .",
    "the key novelty of the l  band angular differential imaging is that it is also sensitive to planets as old as a few gyr .",
    "this enables the study of relatively old nearby stars , whose proximity allows us to directly planets on orbits comparable to that of jupiter ( @xmath10  au ) .    exploiting the strength of this technique we are carrying out a 6  pc volume  limited survey of m  stars using the mmt / clio 35 camera ( e.g. @xcite ) . with 14 allocated nights we are covering 35 northern m",

    "contrast imaging technique .",
    "our naco survey of 21 nearby young stars demonstrates that the giant planet population does not extend beyond 30 au and suggests a cut - off at radius @xmath1 15 au .",
    "most previous imaging surveys have not detected planets because they targeted young stars ( @xmath9 20 pc ) forcing them to probe orbital radii @xmath920  au .",
