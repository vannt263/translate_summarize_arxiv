    "in the last few years there has been a revival of interest in the lowest - lying scalar mesons .",
    "various authors @xcite-@xcite have debated evidence that their masses lie below @xmath8 gev and do not fit the pattern expected if they were conventional @xmath9 states in the quark model .",
    "this question has also stimulated investigations of meson - meson scattering , where these particles should be `` seen '' and which anyway is one of the classical problems of elementary particle physics .",
    "now it is accepted that the solution to this problem should look like chiral perturbation theory very close to the meson - meson scattering threshold .",
    "but when one moves away from threshold into the resonance region , this essentially polynomial fit to the scattering amplitude requires many higher order terms and is practically difficult to implement . an alternative approach which is the stimulus for the present work , involves retaining chiral symmetry but using a resonance rather than a polynomial basis for the scattering amplitude .",
    "this will not be as accurate near threshold but may be expected to give a simple reasonable picture in the energies up to the @xmath8 gev region .",
    "the @xmath10 approximation to qcd @xcite provides a motivation but not a strict proof of this method .",
    "recently it has been applied to @xmath11 scattering @xcite , @xmath2 scattering @xcite and to @xmath12 decays @xcite . a light scalar - isoscalar  @xmath13  and a light scalar - isospinor ",
    "@xmath14  were found to be necessary to fit the @xmath11 and @xmath15 scattering data .",
    "the known @xmath5 was also included as a direct channel resonance in the @xmath11 case and the known @xmath6 was observed to play an important role in the @xmath16 decay processes . in the present paper",
    "we directly investigate the @xmath17 scattering process which is expected to feature the @xmath6 as well as the higher scalar isovector @xmath7 .",
    "we are employing the same method as in the previous treatments in the hope of checking the validity and improving our understanding of the approach .",
    "as before , the amplitude will be constructed from a chiral invariant lagrangian treated at tree level but `` regularized '' near the direct channel poles .",
    "the regularization will be regarded as restoring unitarity in the vicinity of the poles .",
    "the resulting amplitude starts out crossing symmetric but not exactly unitary .",
    "the burden of the method is to approximately satisfy unitarity as well as crossing symmetry .",
    "it seems reasonable to include in the effective lagrangian all resonances in the range up to the maximum energy of interest .",
    "we follow this rule up to about 1 gev but , for simplicity , only keep the clearly relevant direct channel pole @xmath7 above this energy .",
    "the @xmath17 scattering actually does turn out to contain some interesting differences from the @xmath11 and @xmath2 cases . in those cases the direct poles @xmath13 and @xmath4 had to have a modified breit - wigner shape , with an extra parameter , in order to fit the experimental data .",
    "this is not unreasonable since these resonances appear in direct competition with the large `` current - algebra '' contact terms , as well as strong vector meson exchange contributions , and thus do not dominate their own channels .",
    "as already seen in the discussion of @xmath12 decay @xcite , vector meson exchanges and `` current algebra '' contact terms do not contribute to @xmath17 scattering in the elastic region .",
    "thus it is appropriate to use the ordinary breit - wigner unitarization for the @xmath6 .    in section ii we give our notation for the scattering problem and treat @xmath17 scattering in the region where the elastic approximation seems reasonable .",
    "this leads to a description of the @xmath6 which is consistent with recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "section iii contains a discussion of the problem of unitarizing the @xmath18 partial wave amplitude and a comparison of the unitary amplitude with our crossing symmetric one . in section",
    "iv the @xmath17 channel is discussed in the inelastic region , up to about @xmath19 gev , which contains the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "the model was simplified by leaving out a number of higher mass resonance crossed - channel exchanges .",
    "a start on the more involved problem of including other channels is made in section v. multi - channel unitarity is checked for the simplified model .",
    "a brief summary and directions for further work are given in section vi .",
    "appendix a gives our chiral lagrangian and numerical parameters , while appendix b shows the elastic @xmath18 @xmath17 partial wave amplitude to interested readers .",
    "we now discuss @xmath17 scattering in a similar way to that previously employed for @xmath11 and @xmath2 scattering . in this section",
    "we limit attention to the energy range ( up to roughly 1.2 gev ) where the elastic approximation seems at least qualitatively reasonable .    the amplitude , as in the previous treatments ,",
    "will be obtained from the tree graphs of the chiral lagrangian of pseudoscalars , vectors and scalars given in appendix a. this is motivated by the large @xmath21 approximation to qcd .",
    "as is well known experimentally , the low energy @xmath17 scattering is dominated by the @xmath6 scalar resonance .",
    "in detail the @xmath17 scattering turns out to be much simpler than the @xmath11 and @xmath2 @xcite cases . in those examples the leading contributions near threshold were due to the so - called current algebra contact term ( from the first term of eq .",
    "( [ lag_psv ] ) ) and the terms associated with vector meson exchange .",
    "it is easy to see , using g - parity and isospin conservation , that there are no vector meson exchanges possible for @xmath22 scattering at tree level .",
    "similarly the pseudoscalar contact contribution ( first term of eq .",
    "( [ lag_psv ] ) ) which has the same structure as the vector meson exchange contribution , vanishes identically for @xmath17 scattering .",
    "thus , considering at first only exchanges of particles less than about 1 gev in mass , restricts us to the scalar mesons .",
    "this process then provides a very clean channel for studying the scalar meson properties .",
    "feynman diagrams , representing the contribution of the scalar mesons to the scattering amplitude , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fd_pe2pe ] .",
    "the tree level invariant amplitude is then simply    @xmath23    here @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the @xmath27 s , scalar @xmath28 pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants , were numerically determined in previous papers @xcite . finally , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ ape ] ) is a small correction which arises from the pseudoscalar symmetry breaker of eq .",
    "( [ pssb ] ) and involves the @xmath29 mixing angle @xmath30 .",
    "numerical values of this and other relevant parameters are listed in appendix a. note that the momentum dependences in the numerators of the scalar exchange diagrams originate from the chiral symmetric interaction of eq .",
    "( [ lag_scalars ] ) .",
    "the structure of this amplitude is similar to that for the decay process @xmath12 .",

    "( [ lag_scalars ] ) was able to explain the dalitz plot and overall rate for the decay process ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 had previously been found from @xmath11 and @xmath2 scattering @xcite ) .",
    "an important check of the amplitude is that it obeys the general crossing symmetry relation : @xmath35 while this maps the physical @xmath17 scattering region to an unphysical one , it is a restriction on the analytic form of @xmath36 .    of course , as written , eq .",
    "( [ ape ] ) can not be meaningfully compared with experiment for a range of energy beyond 1 gev because there is a physical divergence at @xmath37 . a usual way to handle",
    "this problem is to `` regularize '' the expression by making the substitution : @xmath38 } , \\label{reg}\\ ] ] where the @xmath39 function guarantees that there is no imaginary part below threshold . a similar substitution for @xmath40 which maintains crossing symmetry ( eq . ( [ crossing ] ) )",
    "gives no imaginary piece since @xmath41 in the physical scattering region .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 in the elastic approximation is interpreted as the decay rate for @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the final pion s momentum in the @xmath46 rest frame .",

    "thus the elastic approximation for @xmath17 scattering seems not too bad even slightly beyond the @xmath49 threshold .",
    "the effect of this small inelasticity is taken into account by using @xmath50 mev rather than 65 mev .    to go further in the analysis it is important to discuss the unitarity constraint on the scattering amplitude .",

    "the s - channel graph contribution violates unitarity by itself but the @xmath86 and other exchanges act to restore the bound .",

    "all in all , the essentially zero parameter prediction shown in fig .",
    "[ pe2pe_bg ] seems reasonable .",
    "of course , satisfying the unitarity bound is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition for unitarity .",
    "to go further one may take different points of view . the simplest is to consider that our prediction is most accurate and just given for the real part of the amplitude .",
    "the motivation for this is that the tree graph approximation is purely real .",
    "imaginary parts are introduced   and @xmath2 scattering @xcite the regularizations for the @xmath86 and @xmath87 were introduced as arbitrary parameters which were varied to make @xmath83 agree with its experimental shape .",

    "we note that the problem of constructing an invariant amplitude satisfying both crossing symmetry ( eq .",

    "( [ unitaritycircle ] ) such that partial wave unitarity in the @xmath81 channel was satisfied .",

    "[ mods_pe2pe ] .",
    "it is seen that the unitarity violation in the elastic case ( dashed line ) is not very severe ; this is due to the fact that the @xmath6 resonance , which is approximately of breit - wigner shape , dominates .    if @xmath95 had turned out to be greater than @xmath96 at some values of @xmath24 , we would have of course been unable to impose unitarity with the above method .",
    "it seems interesting to discuss a more or less conventional type of unitarization procedure which can be used in such a case .",

    "this results in an overall minus sign which converts the resonance peak into a dip .",
    "this is the same mechanism  the ramsauer - townsend effect  which was observed in atomic scattering @xcite a long time ago .",

    "of course the large current algebra and vector meson pieces were very important in previous discussions of the @xmath11 and @xmath2 scatterings . in this sense , since they only enter through the `` back door '' of an off - diagonal channel for @xmath17 scattering , the @xmath17 scattering is effectively simpler to treat in our model .    here , as mentioned above , we have just made an initial exploration of the coupled - channel @xmath17 scattering problem .",
    "a fuller treatment would include the exchanges of spin 2 and other higher mass resonances and also scattering processes having @xmath49 and @xmath165 initial states .",
    "for example important contributions in the @xmath49 case may be expected from the @xmath126 .",
    "we studied @xmath0 scattering in a model where the starting amplitude was computed at tree level from a phenomenological chiral lagrangian containing exchanges of resonances having masses within the energy range of interest .",
    "divergences at the direct channel poles were regularized in a conventional manner .",
    "previously this method was applied to @xmath1 scattering and @xmath2 scattering ; consistency required the existence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 scalar resonances . from that work and also from a related study of @xmath166 decay , all the light scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants were determined .",
    "these were used without change in the present work , which essentially involves no new parameters .",
    "we first examined the roughly elastic region ( up to about 1.2 gev ) which is dominated by the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "it is noteworthy that neither vector mesons nor large `` current algebra '' contact terms can contribute in this region , unlike the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cases .",
    "the non - trivial contributions all arise from light scalar meson exchanges .",
    "thus @xmath167 scattering seems an excellent channel for learning more about these resonances which are of great current interest .",
    "our model in section ii was exactly crossing symmetric , but not exactly unitary . to see why that model which features an @xmath6 with mass and width consistent with the experimental values",
    "is not automatically unitary we note the following two points : first , the amplitude is more general than a pure breit - wigner pole for the @xmath6 s - channel since @xmath86 and @xmath168 t - channel exchanges and @xmath6 u - channel exchange also exist .",
    "furthermore chiral symmetry dictates a non - trivial momentum dependence of the coupling factors .    to further investigate this question we constructed ( in section iii ) a related partial wave amplitude which we made unitary without regard for crossing symmetry .",
    "a comparison of the unitary and the crossing symmetric amplitudes showed that they were in fact close ; the difference between them gives an estimate of the uncertainty of our approach .",
    "it is encouraging to us that treating the @xmath6 in @xmath17 scattering by the same method as used in earlier discussions of @xmath11 scattering ( in which a @xmath13 and the @xmath5 appeared ) and @xmath15 scattering ( in which a @xmath14 was needed ) seems to be reasonable .",
    "now , all the members of a possible low - lying scalar nonet have been studied through their appearance in meson - meson scattering .",
    "of course , many questions remain .",
    "one concerns the `` family '' structure of such a possible nonet ; we have discussed some speculations on this aspect elsewhere @xcite . from the present viewpoint , the most important aspect concerns improving our understanding of the meson - meson chiral scattering amplitude .",
    "clearly , one way to proceed is to examine the model at higher energies .",
    "we thus made a preliminary exploration in section iv of the nearby inelastic region ( roughly @xmath169 gev ) .",
    "this range features the @xmath7 scalar resonance .",
    "it turns out that the earlier terms produce essentially zero background interference at the position of the @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is natural to add this particle into the picture directly , yielding a crossing symmetric amplitude .",
    "this amplitude was seen to satisfy the unitarity bounds when the effects of inelasticity were incorporated in the regularization of the @xmath7 pole .",
    "the incomplete experimental data on the @xmath7 branching ratios were interpreted with the aid of a simple model .",
    "similar preliminary discussions were given for the @xmath118 and @xmath164 off - diagonal processes .",
    "an additional complication showed up in the @xmath118 case . here",
    "the vector meson @xmath170 exchange and a large current algebra contact term both contribute as in the @xmath11 and @xmath2 scatterings .",
    "nevertheless it was found that the exactly crossing symmetric amplitudes for @xmath22 , @xmath49 and @xmath171 satisfied the unitarity relation amongst themselves to a reasonable accuracy until about 1.4 gev .",
    "there are many interesting directions for future work . clearly a full 3-channel analysis and investigation of various alternative unitarization schemes is suggested .",
    "inclusion of the many resonances in the @xmath169 gev range which can be exchanged is also desirable .",
    "especially interesting are the effects of the isoscalar scalars in this energy regime . together with",
    "parallel expanded treatments of the @xmath11 and @xmath2 cases we may hope to learn about a second possible scalar nonet containing the @xmath7 and @xmath172 .",
    "the knowledge of the scalar coupling constants obtained from refined analyses can be useful in the treatment of other physical processes .",
    "the recently measured @xcite radiative decay @xmath173 is especially important .",
    "we would like to thank francesco sannino for helpful discussions .",
    "the work has been supported in part by the us doe under contract de - fg-02 - 85er 40231 .",
    "first we write the chiral lagrangian of pseudoscalars and vectors .",
    "this makes use of the @xmath174 matrix @xmath175 wherein @xmath176 represents the usual @xmath174 matrix of pseudoscalar fields . defining the square root @xmath177 by @xmath178 we consider the combinations @xmath179 under a chiral transformation @xmath180 , @xmath177 transforms as : @xmath181 which defines @xmath182 .",
    "a vector meson nonet @xmath183 transforms as a gauge field @xmath184 similarly @xmath185 while @xmath186 the chiral invariant ( neglecting quark mass induced terms ) langrangian of pseudoscalars and vectors may then be written as @xmath187 -\\frac{1}{2 } m_{\\rho}^2 \\mbox{tr }    \\left(\\rho_\\mu - \\frac { v_\\mu}{\\widetilde{g } } \\right)^2 - \\frac{m_0 ^ 2 f_\\pi^2}{96 } { \\left ( { \\rm { ln } } \\frac { { \\rm { det } } u}{{\\rm{det}}{u}^{\\dagger } } \\right ) } ^2 ,   \\label{lag_psv}\\ ] ] where @xmath188 $ ] is the vector meson _ gauge field strength_. @xmath189 gev is the pion decay constant , @xmath190 is the vector meson gauge coupling constant and @xmath191 is a mass for the unmixed @xmath192 field .",

    "we take @xmath198 gev , @xmath199 gev , @xmath200 gev , @xmath201 gev and @xmath202 gev .",
    "next consider the chiral invariant lagrangian involving the scalar nonet field @xmath203 .",

    "( [ lag_scalars ] ) consider @xmath208 which yields the identification @xmath209 .",
