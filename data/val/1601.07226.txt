    "the idea of using a corrugated structure as a  dechirper \" in a linac - based x - ray fel was first proposed in ref .",
    "the idea was to use a passive device to remove residual energy chirp in the beam before it enters the undulator for lasing .",
    "the original report considered a round structure .",
    "however , to allow for adjustability , it was next proposed to use a corrugated structure in flat geometry .",
    "but because of an unavoidable quadrupole wake excited in flat geometry , the structure is best built in two halves , with one half rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other , in order to , in principle , have the quad wake forces cancel .",
    "such structures have been built by radiabeam and tested , first at pohang  @xcite and more recently at the linac coherent light souce ( lcls )  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the radiabeam / lcls dechirper is the first one that has been tested at high energies ( multi gev ) and short bunch lengths ( 10 s of microns ) .    for a nominal set of parameters for the lcls , the dominant wavelength of the wakefields @xmath0  mm  ( see _",
    "@xcite ) . the full bunch length , however , is normally small , @xmath1  @xmath2 m .",
    "thus , we can expect that a model of the longitudinal ( steady - state ) wake that assumes that it is constant and equal to its value at the origin can be used to approximate the wake effects of the beam in such machines .",
    "the real wake will drop from the origin  ( see @xcite ) , and such a model will give a maximum bound of the wake , one that becomes more accurate as the bunch becomes shorter ( assuming it is not so short that the transient component of the wake becomes significant ) .",
    "for the transverse wake , equal to zero at the origin , we use an approximation of a linear function with the constant slope equal to that at the origin .",
    "we will see that , compared to numerically calculating the wakes , we gain by obtaining simple analytical functions that show us the structure of the wakes .",
    "the calculation of wakes of corrugated structures has been performed for round structures , assuming small corrugations and using perturbation methods  @xcite , @xcite . the same has been done for flat geometry  @xcite.time domain simulations have been performed for more accurate results , particularly when the corrugation parameters are not small compared to the dechirper gap  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , a detailed analysis of the radiabeam / lcls dechirper has been performed using field matching methods  @xcite . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the case of flat geometry and assuming the impedance can be characterized by a surface impedance , equations for the _ generalized _ wakefields , valid for arbitrary bunch length , are derived . by",
    " generalized \" we mean ( point charge ) wake functions for which the transverse positions of driving and test particles are arbitrary , and are not limited to being near the symmetry plane .",
    "we begin the present report with the results of  @xcite and obtain the values at the origin of the ( generalized ) longitudinal wake and the slope of the transverse wakes .",
    "that is enough to obtain an approximation to the energy loss and kick experienced by a pencil beam ( one with no transverse extent ) .",
    "there is some interest in using a dechirper as a fast kicker , by passing a beam close to one jaw ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , and the case of the beam near the wall is automatically included .",
    "then , assuming that the transverse beam sizes are small compared to the gap , we derive perturbation solutions of the wakes , valid over a small neighborhood around the beam centroid .",
    "this allows us to find wake effects like slice energy spread increase and projected emittance growth .",
    "next , we briefly investigate the accuracy of our model .",
    "we finally end with conclusions . in the appendix",
    ", we give a more accurate derivation , than found in @xcite , of the flat geometry wakes for arbitrary bunch lengths .",
    "representative beam and machine parameters for the lcls , which will be used in example calculations in this report , are given in table  i. note that the entire radiabeam / lcls dechirper assembly comprises two 2-m - long sections , one oriented horizontally , the other vertically .",
    "the wakes are given here in cgs units ; to convert to mks one merely needs to multiply by @xmath3 , with @xmath4  @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "wakefield induced energy loss , however , has been converted to mks units , for convenience .",
    ".selected beam and machine properties ( at the dechirper ) used in example calculations .",
    "this is a typical combination of parameters found in ref .",
    "the longitudinal bunch distribution is taken to be uniform .",
    "in the current lattice , the first ( second ) dechirper is vertically ( horizontally ) orientated , with positive ( negative ) @xmath7 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2_tab ]",
    "we began with general expressions for the wakefields in a corrugated structure dechiper with flat geometry , derived in  @xcite .",
    "we took the limits of short bunch length and obtained simplified , approximate expressions for the longitudinal and transverse wakefields , functions that are reasonably accurate for the type of bunch lengths used in _",
    "e.g. _ the lcls .",
    "we then used these functions to obtain , for a short bunch passing through a dechirper : the energy loss as function of gap , the transverse kick as function of beam offset , the slice energy spread , and the emittance growth of the beam .",
    "we performed a thick lens calculation of emittance growth for the two - dechirper system applied to representative lcls bunch and machine parameters and found that the cancellation does indeed work ; the final projected emittance growth is modest : @xmath8 ( 1.12 ) in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we briefly investigated the accuracy of our model , and find that it overestimates the wakes by @xmath1130% for the type of parameters considered in this study ( in particular , full bunch length @xmath12  @xmath2 m and dechirper half - gap @xmath13  mm and the bunch on axis ) . for shorter bunches the model becomes more accurate .    in the appendix",
    "we perform a more accurate derivation of the general wake solution for the dechirper ( the starting point of the main work of this report ) than found in ref .",
    "we find that the results of @xcite are valid provided that the bunch length over half gap , @xmath14 , is small , which is indeed the parameter regime of interest .",
    "although in our example calculation the emittance increase was modest , and the cancellation of emittance growth using the two dechirper sections was effective , we would like to point out that large emittance growth is not far away in parameter space , especially if the gap is decreased ( note the @xmath15 dependence in eq .",
    "[ epsf_eq ] ) .",
    "for example , if in the example calculation above we reduce the energy from @xmath16  gev to @xmath17  gev , and the half gap @xmath13  mm to 0.5  mm , we find that @xmath18 . for this example we obtain a large emttance growth for the full , two dechirper , thick lens calculation : @xmath19 ( 2.5 ) in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that although we started with a surface impedance , the surface impedance itself never is part of the solution .",
    "this means that the results given here are valid not only for the corrugated pipe dechirper , but rather for _ any _ structure with flat geometry where the impedance can be described by a surface impedance .",
    "such problems include the resistive wall , the shallow corrugated structure ( often used as a model for surface roughness ) , and a metallic pipe lined with a thin dielectric layer .",
    "the only condition for their applicability is that the bunch lengths of interest are small compared to the characteristic distance of the problem .",

    "we begin from maxwell s equations in which we assume that all quantities depend on time and @xmath20 as @xmath21 with @xmath22 and make the fourier transform over @xmath9 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a component of the electromagnetic field . to simplify the notation , in what follows",
    ", we drop the hats in the fourier transformed components of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the trajectory of the driving particle has a zero horizontal offset , @xmath25 , but it is offset in the vertical direction , @xmath26 . the current density corresponding to the the driving particle in @xmath27 representation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the amplitude of the fourier component of the current .",
    "the electromagnetic field generated by the driving particle satisfy the maxwell equations in free space : @xmath30 the last term on the right - hand side accounts for the current associated with the particle .",
    "given that the solution of these equation is proportional to the current @xmath29 , to simplify notation , below we set @xmath31 ; this makes the last term on the right - hand side of the last equation in   equal to @xmath32 .",
    "the maxwell equations are supplemented by the boundary conditions at the upper and lower walls , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the surface impedance .",
    "we seek @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the following form @xmath37 where the terms with @xmath38 are due to the presence of the delta function source in   and the amplitudes @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are arbitrary numbers . substituting these equations into the last equation of   we find the longitudinal electric field",
    "@xmath43 similarly , @xmath44 , @xmath36 and @xmath45 can be expressed through @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the hyperbolic functions from the third , fourth and the fifth equations of  .",
    "after that the amplitudes @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be found from the four boundary conditions  . substituting them in   we obtain the following result , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 the longitudinal impedance is related to @xmath49 by the following formula @xmath50 where in the last equality we recalled our assumption @xmath51 . substituting   into eq .",
    "gives a general expression for the longitudinal impedance without any assumption .",
    "the expression   that we use in the main body of this paper is obtained from   and   if one takes into account that @xmath52 and also assumes @xmath53 .",
    "the latter is justified for short bunches with @xmath54 . with these assumptions",
