    "<S> using worm - type quantum monte carlo simulations , we investigate bosonic mixtures on the triangular lattice of two species of bosons , which interact via nearest - neighbour intraspecies ( @xmath0 ) and onsite interspecies ( @xmath1 ) repulsions . for the case of symmetric hopping amplitude ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we determine a rich ground - state phase diagram that contains double solid , double superfluid ( 2sf ) , supersolid ( ss ) , solid - superfluid ( solid - sf ) and counterflow supersolid ( css ) states . </S>",
    "<S> the ss , solid - sf and css states exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking among the three sublattices of the triangular lattice and between the two species , which leads to nonzero crystalline density wave order in each species . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore show that the css and the ss states are present for @xmath4 , and the latter even survives up to @xmath5 or @xmath6 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the effects induced by the variation of @xmath7 and by the imbalance of particle numbers of the two species are also explored . </S>"
