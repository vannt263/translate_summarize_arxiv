    "the study of regularity of solutions of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) has been a topic of great interest within stochastic analysis , especially since malliavin calculus was founded .",
    "one of the main motivations of malliavin calculus is precisely to study the regularity properties of the law of wiener functionals , for instance , solutions to sdes , as well as , properties of their densities .",
    "a classical result on this subject is that if the coefficients of an sde are @xmath0 functions with bounded derivatives of any order and the so - called hrmander s condition ( see e.g. @xcite ) holds , then the solution of the equation is smooth in the malliavin sense .",
    "then p. malliavin shows in @xcite that the laws of the solutions at any time are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure and the densities are smooth and bounded .",
    "another approach is attributed to n. bouleau and f. hirsch where they show in @xcite absolute continuity of the finite dimensional laws of solutions to sdes based on a stochastic calculus of variations in finite dimensions where they use a limit argument .",
    "also , as a motivation of @xcite , d. nualart and m. zakai @xcite found related results on the existence and smoothness of conditional densities of malliavin differentiable random variables .",
    "it appears to be quite difficult to derive regularity properties for the densities of solutions to sdes with singular coefficients , i.e. non - lipschitz coefficients , in particular in the drift",
    ". nevertheless , some findings in this direction have been attained .",
    "let us for instance remark here the work by m. hayashi , a. kohatsu - higa and g. yki in @xcite where the authors show that sdes with hlder continuous drift and smooth elliptic diffusion coefficients admit hlder continuous densities at any time .",
    "their techniques are mainly based on an integration by parts formula ( ipf ) in the malliavin setting and estimates on the characteristic function of the solution in connection with fourier s inversion theorem .",
    "another result in this direction is due to s. de marco in @xcite where the author proves smoothness of the density on an open domain under the usual condition of ellipticity and that the coefficients are smooth on such domain .",
    "a remarkable fact is that hrmander s condition is skipped in this proof .",
    "moreover , estimates for the tails are also given .",
    "the technique relies strongly on malliavin calculus and an ipf together with estimates on the fourier transform of the solution .",
    "one may already observe that integration by parts formulas in the malliavin context are a powerful tool for the investigation of densities of random variables as it is the case in the work by v. bally and l. caramellino in @xcite where an ipf is derived and the integrability of the weight obtained in the formula gives the desired regularity of the density . as a consequence of the aforesaid result and t. nilssen give in @xcite a criterion to obtain regularity of densities of solutions to sdes according to how regular the drift is .",
    "the technique is also based on malliavin calculus and a sharp estimate on the moments of the derivative of the flow associated to the solution .",
    "this result is a slight improvement of a very similar criterion obtained by s. kusuoka and d. stroock in @xcite when the diffusion coefficient is constant and the drift may be unbounded .",
    "another related result on upper and lower bounds for densities is due to v. bally and a. kohatsu - higa in @xcite where bounds for the density of a type of a two - dimensional degenerated sde are obtained . for this case",
    ", it is assumed that the coefficients are five times differentiable with bounded derivatives .",
    "finally , we also mention the results by a. kohatsu - higa and a. makhlouf in @xcite where the authors show smoothness of the density for smooth coefficients that may also depend on an external process whose drift coefficient is irregular .",
    "they also give upper and lower estimates for the density .",
    "it is worth alluding the exceptional result by a. debussche and n. fournier in @xcite on this topic where the authors show that the finite dimensional densities of a solution of an sde with jumps lies in a certain ( low regular ) besov space when the drift is hlder continuous .",
    "the novelty is that their method does not use malliavin calculus as in the aforementioned works .",
    "it is therefore important to highlight that in this paper we do _ not _ use malliavin calculus or any other type of variational calculus and we see this as an alternative perspective for studying similar problems .",
    "instead , we employ control theory techniques to , shortly speaking , reduce the overall problem to a critical case for which many results in the literature are available . in particular , our technique entitles us to find a _",
    "worst case _ sde whose solution has an explicit density that dominates all densities of solutions to sdes among those with measurable bounded drifts .",
    "we believe this method is robust since no well - behaviour on the drift is needed other than merely boundedness and no markovianity of the system is assumed .",
    "certainly , no regularity is obtained but we are confident that the method can be exploited to gain more regularity of the densities .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ main results ]",
    "we summarise our main results with some generalisations to non - trivial diffusion coefficients and to any arbitrary dimension .",
    "we also give some insight on concrete properties of the bounds as well as some examples with graphics .",
    "section [ s : reduction ] is devoted to thoroughly prove the assertions of the main results .",
