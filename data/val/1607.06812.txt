    "abelian discrete symmetries has been successfully investigated in this context  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the groups 3  @xcite , @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite have shed some light on the structure of the quark and neutrino sectors , providing in some cases an explanation of proton stability and dark matter  @xcite or an explanation of the _ dirac  ness _ of neutrinos  @xcite . these symmetries have in common that they are subgroups of @xmath0 , which however has been explored only aiming at a tri  bimaximal neutrino  mixing structure or similar  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath7 is now known to be nonzero , the potential of @xmath0 as a flavor symmetry must be revisited . to pave",
    "the way to a vast revision on this subject is one of the goals of this work .    on the other hand , despite their success , the origin of flavor symmetries remains unexplained in bottom  up model building .",
    "fortunately , non  abelian flavor symmetries emerge naturally in different compactification schemes of string theory  @xcite that enjoy the properties of the sm or its supersymmetric extension(s ) , yielding a promising ultraviolet completion of flavor phenomenology .",
    "toroidal heterotic orbifolds  @xcite ( see e.g.  @xcite for a comprehensive introduction ) lead to models which reproduce the gauge group and matter spectrum of the sm  @xcite , its minimal supersymmetric extension  @xcite and other non  minimal extensions  @xcite , as well as many other observed and/or desirable properties of particle physics  @xcite . as we discuss in section  [ sec : symmetries ] , following previous findings of  @xcite , a @xmath0 flavor symmetry can emerge in these constructions as a result of dividing a @xmath8 torus by 3 in the compact dimensions .",
    "a paramount difference between the flavor theory emerging in this context and one arbitrarily proposed is that all properties , including the flavor representations and number of fields , are dictated by the string compactification itself , resulting in interesting phenomenological consequences that we aim at studying in this paper .    due to their geometrical structure , 3 or 3@xmath12",
    "heterotic orbifolds could in principle yield a @xmath0 flavor symmetry , but it is known that no promising model where this symmetry remains unbroken arises in those cases  @xcite",
    ". therefore , the simplest complete string scenarios with sm  like physics and this flavor symmetry are 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the phenomenological viability of the @xmath0 flavor symmetry from a top  down and a bottom  up perspective . after explaining in section  [ sec : symmetries ] how flavor symmetries relate to geometry in heterotic string compactifications , in section  [ sec : class ] we perform a search of semi  realistic 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifold models , which turn out to display @xmath0 as a flavor symmetry more naturally than other possibilities . in section  [ sec : stringydelta54 ] we inspect the flavor symmetries and spectrum properties of one string sample model .",
    "inspired by the features of the string models , in section  [ sec : delta54pheno ] we propose a model that reproduces at some level known flavor observations and provides predictions for the neutrino sector . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we provide our concluding remarks .",
    "we follow here the discussion of  @xcite , stressing some important aspects for our work .    in higher dimensional models , such as the string theories , flavor symmetries result from the geometrical symmetries ( and other properties ) of the extra dimensions ( see e.g.  @xcite for a field  theoretical proposal ) . since in those models the extra dimensions",
    "must be compactified in order to justify that we only perceive four dimensions , the compact space adopts geometrical structures which are endowed with symmetries that are passed down , as flavor symmetries , to the fields arising in those constructions .    among all possibilities ,",
    "orbifolds are perhaps the simplest compactifications .",
    "a @xmath9dimensional orbifold is defined as the quotient of @xmath10 divided by a discrete group .",
    "the resulting space is a compact solid , exhibiting typically some curvature singularities ( fixed points of the orbifold ) , at which matter states may be localized . in the absence of local effects at the singularities ,",
    "the states attached to all singularities are indistinguishable .",
    "the transformations ( permutations , reflections , etc . ) of those identical states that leave the matter distribution invariant build a ( non - abelian ) symmetry of the compactified theory .",
    "note that such transformations are equivalent to field relabelings .    as a first example , let us suppose that an orbifold yields a compact space endowed with two singularities at which two matter generations are chosen to be localized .",
    "since these localized matter generations are indistinguishable , i.e. have identical quantum numbers , excepting of course for their localization properties , a permutation or relabeling of the generations does not alter the system .",
    "that is , the system is invariant under an @xmath11 permutation symmetry , leading to an effective model with two generations that build a doublet under an @xmath11 symmetry .    in string theory ,",
    "the simplest and yet quite promising compactifications of this kind are toroidal heterotic orbifolds  @xcite .",
    "they are achieved by letting first the six extra dimensions of a 10d heterotic string be compact by imposing the quotient @xmath12 , where @xmath13 can be chosen as a 6d root lattice of a lie group @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting 6d torus @xmath15 is then divided by a discrete group of its isometries @xmath16 , yielding the orbifold @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is abelian when @xmath16 is abelian . for simplicity",
    ", we shall focus here only on abelian orbifolds .",
    "not any arbitrary choice of @xmath19 and @xmath16 is admissible . requiring unbroken supersymmetry in the effective 4d field theory as well as considering topological equivalences between compactifications with different geometries",
    "reduce greatly the number of allowed heterotic orbifolds .",
    "in fact , all possible 6d orbifolds of this type have been exhaustively classified  @xcite , resulting in a small number of abelian orbifolds and thus a small number of possible geometrical symmetries to be considered .",
    "in contrast to a bottom - up approach , where matter fields are arbitrarily localized at the singularities or let free in the bulk , in heterotic orbifolds matter localization is restricted by the compactification rules .",
    "all fields of the 4d effective field theories emerging from heterotic compactifications arise from the ( anomaly , tachyon and ghost free ) spectrum of excitations of _ closed _ strings that are not affected by the action of the orbifold .    in ( supersymmetric ) heterotic orbifolds , bulk or _ untwisted fields _ correspond to the orbifold ",
    "invariant states arising directly from the 10d closed strings of the uncompactified heterotic string , whose field limit is 10d @xmath20 supergravity endowed with an 8@xmath18 or @xmath21 yang  mills theory .",
    "thus , the 4d gauge ( super)fields , generating the unbroken 4d gauge group @xmath22 or @xmath21 , and some 4d matter states live in the bulk of a heterotic orbifold .    additionally , there are the so  called _ twisted fields _ , which arise from strings that are closed only due to the action of the orbifold .",
    "twisted fields are always localized at singularities of the orbifold and are thus instrumental in the conception of a flavor theory with non  trivial representations from strings . as long as there are no further compactification ingredients , such as wilson lines  @xcite or discrete torsion  @xcite , that may lead to differences in the states at the singular points , the _ twisted _ spectrum is degenerate , i.e. all singularities carry identical twisted string states .",
    "couplings among string states are subject to a set of constraints called string selection rules  @xcite , due to symmetries of the underlying conformal field theory of the compactified string theory .",
    "these selection rules establish for which combination of string states there is a non  zero correlation function , and thus a non  zero coupling for the associated effective fields . in the 4d model emerging from an abelian heterotic orbifold ,",
    "the selection rules amount to include additional ( abelian @xmath23 ) symmetries and assign thus appropriate discrete charges to each field in the model .",
    "thus , we notice that flavor symmetries in abelian toroidal heterotic orbifolds have two sources : the group of non  abelian ( relabeling ) symmetries @xmath24 from the geometrical structure of the compactification space and the group of abelian symmetries @xmath25 from the string selection rules . in the case that the string selection rules provide a normal subgroup ( invariant under conjugation ) of the full symmetry group , the resulting flavor symmetry is isomorphic to the semi ",
    "direct product @xmath26 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let us turn now to a relevant example for the present work .",
    "suppose that two extended dimensions are compactified in the orbifold @xmath27 , where we choose the torus to be defined by the root lattice @xmath28 which is invariant under the 3 generator @xmath29 in complex coordinates .",
    "that is , in the orbifold , points @xmath30 and @xmath31 of @xmath32 are equivalent if they can be related by @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in this orbifold , there exist three inequivalent fixed points or orbifold singularities . ]",
    "@xmath35 , such that @xmath36 for some lattice vectors @xmath37 .",
    "we can choose the inequivalent fixed points to be @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 span @xmath28 , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : t2overz3a ] .",
    "the gray region contains all inequivalent points in this orbifold .    remarking in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2overz3a ] that the upper tip is equivalent to @xmath42 and that the lines on both sides of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , are identified , the orbifold becomes the triangular pillow ",
    "like object with three apices displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2overz3b ] .",
    "this solid is clearly invariant under all possible apex permutations , as symbolized by the arrows in that figure .",
    "thus , we identify a geometrical @xmath5 symmetry .    when the current example is applied to heterotic orbifolds , the string selection rules demand additionally that any coupling of the form @xmath45 among string states ( setting @xmath46 for untwisted states ) satisfy first @xmath47 .",
    "noting that this relation corresponds to a 3 symmetry , it can be rewritten as @xmath48 in terms of a 3 generator @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , assigning a charge @xmath50 to @xmath51twisted states ( and @xmath52 to @xmath53twisted states and @xmath54 to untwisted states ) , non  vanishing string couplings require that the couplings themselves be non  twisted , i.e. @xmath55 , which can be rewritten as @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we identify a 3@xmath13 arising from the selection rules .",
    "finally , since the 3@xmath13 obtained is a normal subgroup of the group generated by @xmath5 and @xmath57 , then the resulting effective flavor symmetry of a @xmath27 orbifold can be written as @xmath58 .    in the absence of wilson lines and discrete torsion",
    ", twisted string states replicate in all orbifold singularities , thus appearing always with a multiplicity of three and building triplet representations .",
    "since @xmath59 , twisted states located at the @xmath53 fixed points have the opposite geometrical quantum numbers of the @xmath51twisted states .",
    "that is , if we label as @xmath60 the @xmath51twisted states , representations . ]",
    "those generated at the @xmath53 singularities build then the representation @xmath61 .",
    "untwisted states and twisted states affected by wilson lines or discrete torsion are just @xmath0 trivial singlets @xmath62 .",
    "no other @xmath0 representations appear in this context , yielding a tight and useful string constraint for flavor phenomenology .",
    "this discussion has been explicitly developed for all possible sub  orbifolds ( in less than six dimensions ) appearing in abelian toroidal heterotic orbifolds  @xcite , resulting in a reduced number of family symmetries .",
    "the findings include , besides @xmath0 , only the symmetries @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as we shall see , these symmetries are enlarged in the full 6d heterotic orbifold , but can then be finally reduced back to these symmetries in phenomenologically viable models .",
    "this may already be considered a phenomenologically relevant observation : not any flavor symmetry is allowed in particle physics if it arises from a compactified string theory .",
    "the purpose of this section is to identify string models exhibiting a number of semi ",
    "realistic properties and @xmath0 flavor symmetry in the simplest compactification scheme where such models are present , 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds .",
    "3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds are characterized by the quotient of a so  called factorizable torus @xmath68 divided by the joint action of two 3 isometries of @xmath69 in the extra dimensions of a heterotic string . in the simplest case,3 choices ,",
    "among which many include rototranslations  @xcite . ] the tori are described by the root lattice of @xmath70 and the 3 generators act diagonally on the tori as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the so  called twist vectors @xmath74 consequently , each of the 2tori are subject to a 3 orbifold .    according to our previous discussion",
    ", one may conjecture that these constructions lead to a @xmath75 flavor symmetry , but this is wrong .",
    "in fact , in this case the relabeling symmetry that naturally appears is @xmath76 .",
    "further , concerning the symmetries due to string selection rules , invariance under the two twists , @xmath51 and @xmath77 , leads to two 3 symmetries analogous to the one for the @xmath78 charge in the previous section .",
    "in addition , localization selection rules introduce one extra 3 factor for each 2torus .",
    "that is , the natural flavor symmetry in these heterotic orbifolds is @xmath79 .",
    "note , however , that the relabeling symmetry can be further enhanced to @xmath80 if the sizes of the tori @xmath81 , @xmath82 , are identical and no wilson lines nor discrete torsion is invoked .",
    "as we shall shortly see , phenomenologically viable models only arise if one introduces wilson lines .",
    "in fact , most promising models have two wilson lines that distinguish the states located at the singularities of two of the tori , retaining only the non - abelian @xmath5 relabeling symmetry .",
    "further , there is no reason why all tori should have the same size ; their sizes ( and also their shapes ) are encoded in the values of ( untwisted ) moduli that can _ a priori _ have arbitrary values .",
    "once the generic geometrical aspects of the compactification have been set , our task is now to apply this compactification to a heterotic string .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the @xmath20 8@xmath18 heterotic string , but expect similar results from the @xmath20 @xmath21 heterotic string",
    ". @xmath83@xmath1@xmath83 heterotic string , although the presence of tachyons at some level of the theory would still be a worry . ] modular invariance of the partition function demands the orbifold to be embedded into the gauge group 8@xmath18 .",
    "this gauge embedding consists in choosing a 16d ( shift ) vector for each of the twists performed in the six compact dimensions and a so  called 16d wilson  line vector @xmath84 , @xmath85 , encoding in the gauge degrees of freedom each @xmath86 of @xmath69 .",
    "the gauge embedding is subject to three constraints .",
    "first , modular invariance additionally imposes in 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds that  @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the 16d vectors that denote respectively the gauge embeddings of the twists @xmath72 and @xmath73 of eq .  .",
    "secondly , both @xmath88 and @xmath89 must be consistent with a 3@xmath13 action .",
    "this amounts to requiring that three times these vectors must be a trivial gauge transformation within 8@xmath18 , i.e. for the shift vector @xmath88 ( with entries @xmath90 )   @xmath91 demanding that the entries @xmath90 be all integer or half  integer , independently for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "analogous conditions must then be imposed to @xmath89 .",
    "the final constraint imposes that wilson ",
    "line vectors must be consistent with the choice of @xmath69 lattice and the action of the orbifold on it .",
    "the fact that the lattice vectors @xmath86 are related by the action of @xmath51 and @xmath77 translates to relations among all @xmath84 .",
    "for instance , in 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds since @xmath94 ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : t2overz3a ] , valid in this case ) , then @xmath95 up to a trivial gauge transformation in 8@xmath18 .",
    "one finds that these geometrical considerations lead to the conditions @xmath96    a comment is in order .",
    "notice that each 2torus can be affected by up to one inequivalent , non  trivial wilson line .",
    "if one includes the wilson line @xmath97 associated with the compactification in the @xmath81 torus , @xmath82 , the relabeling symmetry @xmath5 of that torus disappears . thus , with one and two non  vanishing wilson lines , the non  abelian relabeling symmetry gets broken down , respectively , to @xmath98 and @xmath5 , while no non  abelian symmetry is left when all three wilson lines are non  trivial .",
    "hence , it follows that only models with two non  trivial wilson lines can lead to a @xmath58 flavor symmetry in 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds .    after finding solutions to the constraints",
    " , there are standard techniques , discussed elsewhere in great detail ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , to determine the spectrum of massless string states , including their gauge quantum numbers , localization , couplings and other properties of the _ supersymmetric _ effective field theory .",
    "spectra obtained this way must then be inspected from a phenomenological perspective , imposing criteria based on observable particle physics ( and/or cosmology ) that may discriminate phenomenologically viable models from others .",
    "clearly , given the number of gauge  embedding parameters , the constraints   can be satisfied for a large number of shift and wilson  line vectors , making the task of identifying phenomenologically viable heterotic orbifolds very time  consuming . fortunately , this task becomes accessible thanks to tools such as the ` orbifolder `  @xcite , which automatizes the computation of massless spectra , couplings and other important features of the models .    with the purpose of finding promising models endowed with a @xmath0 flavor symmetry ,",
    "we have used the ` orbifolder ` to randomly construct a large number of inequivalent 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifold models .",
    "models are considered to be equivalent by the software if no differences are found when comparing the full gauge group , the non - abelian gauge quantum numbers of the resulting states and the number of non - abelian gauge singlets in the massless spectrum . from the created models ,",
    "we have then selected the most promising ones . here , a promising model must yield the sm gauge group , such that the hypercharge generator be non  anomalous and ( with normalization ) compatible with grand unification , three generations of quarks and leptons , at least a couple of higgs ( super)fields , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and only vectorlike exotics w.r.t . the sm gauge group .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "we have obtained over @xmath101 inequivalent 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifold models , with up to ( the maximum of ) three inequivalent wilson lines . after applying our phenomenological constraints ,",
    "only 789 models exhibit the required properties .",
    "we have verified that , considering couplings  charge conservation  @xcite .",
    "] of the vectorlike exotics with up to six sm singlets , in a large number of these models all exotics decouple once the sm singlets develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "other models require higher dimensional operators to yield mass terms for all vectorlike exotics .",
    "an interesting geometrical quality of the promising models regards the effective family symmetry . among the 789 selected models , most ( 696 ) of them have two inequivalent non  vanishing wilson lines .",
    "about 10% of the viable models ( 81 of them ) require one non ",
    "trivial wilson line , and only 12 result from compactifications with three wilson lines .",
    "therefore , we find that @xmath0 as a flavor symmetry of ( ms)sm  like models is favored in 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifold models .",
    "this outcome is compatible with previous results found in the literature .",
    "particularly , in ref .",

    "with the purpose of exploring the flavor phenomenology produced by string compactifications , let us now study the properties of one of the promising models from our 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifold scan , chosen due to its simplicity .",

    "if we take e.g. the hierarchical solution , i.e. @xmath184 and @xmath185 , the mass matrices take the form @xmath186 which corresponds to @xmath187 we notice that the hierarchical solution is compatible with the hierarchy of observed fermion masses .    in the down ",

    "the other two mixing angles are very small at leading order , but could be generated if some of the vectorlike quarks mix with the sm quarks , see for instance  @xcite .    for charged leptons , on the other hand ,",
    "the same flavon vev alignment must be imposed because down  quarks and charged leptons share the same flavons .",
    "it follows that the corresponding mass matrix is diagonalized by a rotation in the 12 entries with the mixing angle of the order @xmath191 .",
    "there is another consequence of the parallelism between the down  quarks and charged leptons . since @xmath192 , it follows from eq .   that the following mass relation in our model is required @xmath193 this relation does not match observations , but it may get amended by finite corrections to the fermion masses coming possibly from supersymmetric threshold effects",
    ". however , such corrections depend on several details of the soft  breaking terms which are not constrained by the model presented here . in any case",
    ", we do not expect these effects to alter the unfortunate smallness of the remaining two quark mixing angles since that depends on the hierarchical structure of the fermion masses .      for neutrinos , the major difference w.r.t .",
    "the other sectors is that , besides the presence of majorana mass terms , neutrinos build a conjugate @xmath0 triplet , @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , renormalizable yukawa couplings become possible .    as stated before ,",
    "the neutrino masses arise from a type i see  saw according to the second row of the superpotential  . from there , we can read off the yukawa lagrangian for neutrinos : @xmath194 \\\\ & + & \\lambda_1 \\left[\\bar{\\nu}_1 \\bar{\\nu}_1",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the dirac neutrino mass matrix is proportional to the identity matrix , while rh neutrino masses are governed by a structure similar to the one in eq .",
    ", that is , @xmath195    we can now make a working assumption about the vev of the neutrino flavon @xmath196 .",
    "considering the alignment @xmath197 , the light neutrino mass matrix becomes @xmath198 where we used the definitions @xmath199\\,.\\ ] ] after performing a scan of our parameters , restricting the values of the computed @xmath200 , @xmath201 and neutrino mixing angles to lie within the @xmath202 region of the global fits  @xcite , we find that the mass matrix in eq .",
    "is compatible only with a normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , i.e. an inverted hierarchy is disfavored , coinciding with recent preliminary results from the t2k collaboration  @xcite .     flavor model .",
    "the dark / light / lighter gray areas correspond to @xmath203/@xmath204/@xmath202 experimental precision around the best fit value ( denoted by the star ) for the neutrino mixing angles  @xcite . ]",
    "furthermore , we observe that our model leads to a correlation between the atmospheric and the reactor mixing angles in normal ordering , as displayed by the blue region in fig .  [",
    "fig : atmoreactor ] . comparing with the precision intervals",
    ", we see that the atmospheric mixing angle lies in the second octant , approximately between @xmath205 and @xmath206 degrees , while the reactor mixing angle has values between @xmath207 and @xmath208 degrees , in agreement with the oscillation global fits within @xmath202 .",
    "these values are crucial for the model since a better measurement of the neutrino mixing angles could falsify it .",
    "a final result from our parameter scan is that the lightest neutrino mass , @xmath209 , takes values in the region between @xmath210  mev and @xmath211  mev , and the sum of the light neutrino masses , @xmath212 , lies in the interval between @xmath213  mev and @xmath214  mev .",
    "flavor symmetries arise naturally in string compactifications , which provide a promising ultraviolet completion of usual bottom  up setups .",
    "particularly , we have shown that @xmath0 , as a flavor symmetry , appears most naturally in semi ",
    "realistic 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifold compactifications .",
    "we have identified almost 700 models with that flavor symmetry and other promising particle ",
    "physics features , such as sm gauge group and three generations of matter fields . by their nature , these constructions reduce the arbitrariness of low  energy models by constraining the fields and their ( flavor and gauge ) transformation properties and thereby providing useful guidelines to inspect flavor phenomenology .    to test the viability of @xmath0 flavor scenarios arising from strings , we have studied the phenomenology of one simple string model from our classification . in this model ,",
    "sm fermion fields transform as triplets of the flavor symmetry while the higgs fields do not transform . as a result of the flavor quantum numbers , the quarks and charged leptons",
    "acquire masses through dimension6 operators , and the dirac neutrino masses as well as the rh majorana neutrino masses are generated at renormalizable level .",
    "furthermore , we observe that choosing some special flavon  vev alignments results in the following flavor phenomenology features :    * correct masses for quarks and charged leptons ; * proper gatto - sartori - tonin relation in the quark sector ( although the other two mixing angles are very small ) ; * a mass relation between the down  quark sector and the charged leptonic sector ( see eq .  ) ; * compatibility ( only ) with normal hierarchy of neutrino masses ; * smallest neutrino mass of order @xmath215 mev ; and * pmns matrix compatible with current constraints ( atmospheric and reactor mixing angles are in the @xmath202 region of the global best fit ) , with the atmospheric mixing angle greater than @xmath216 degrees .",
    "interestingly , an inverted hierarchy being disfavored as well as the atmospheric mixing angle lying in the second octant , are features compatible with recent preliminary findings of the t2k collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this outcome lets us assert that 3@xmath13 heterotic orbifolds and @xmath0 as a flavor symmetry provide a fertile playground for useful phenomenology which should be further investigated .    in the sample model that we studied",
    ", we found that the fields in the ( vectorlike ) exotic sector yield another source of interest .",
    "there are a couple of hyper  charged ( @xmath217 ) and colored ( @xmath132 ) exotics that may couple to full scalars ( @xmath124 ) of the model ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : spectrum_model9 ] ) .",
    "if these fields are not too massive , we may entertain the possibility that the correct couplings between these fields and the mentioned vectorlike exotics provide a stringy origin of the ( still ) puzzling di ",
    "photon excess reported by the lhc collaborations  @xcite .",
    "a proper analysis of this possibility is beyond the scope of this paper and can be explored elsewhere .    despite these encouraging features , there are still some challenges to overcome .",
    "first , in heterotic orbifolds it is challenging to obtain the vev alignments chosen in section  [ sec : delta54pheno ] because vevs must be settled by a moduli stabilization mechanism that is not fully understood .",
    "secondly , we found that two of the quark mixing angles in our model are too small and the mass relation eq .",
    "is incorrect . to attempt to alleviate these issues , one should study in detail the soft  terms and other corrections in this kind of models",
    "another potential hurdle is the absence of a symmetry that forbids rapid proton decay .",
    "however , it is possible that such symmetry does appear as one of the extra 3 symmetries of another model where matter fields have the correct charges . finally , as in most flavor models , flavor  changing neutral currents pose a challenge that must and shall be studied elsewhere in the context of our proposal .",
