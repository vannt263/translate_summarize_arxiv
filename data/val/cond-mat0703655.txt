    "radiation resistance of graphite has been one of the major concerns of the nuclear industry.@xcite nowadays , radiation treatment by high - energy electrons or ions is also viewed as a versatile tool for the design of new materials . the formation of irradiation - induced defects in graphite - like layered carbon nanostructures ( multiwalled and bundled carbon nanotubes , nanoonions , etc . ) changes their mechanical @xcite and electronic properties @xcite and may even trigger dramatic structural changes.@xcite however , the structure and dynamics of defects in graphite and carbon nanostructures as well as the mechanisms underlying their creation and transformation remain elusive .",
    "this knowledge is crucial for a defect - assisted engineering of nanostructures with applications in , e.g. , manufacturing of nanoelectromechanical systems.@xcite    radiation damage of matter is governed by the displacement of atoms from their equilibrium positions due to electronic excitations and direct collisions of high - energy particles with the nuclei . in metals and narrow",
    "band gap semiconductors electronic excitations quench instantaneously , leaving collisions with nuclei as the sole mechanism responsible for the creation of defects in graphite and related carbon materials.@xcite if the kinetic energy transferred from a high - energy electron or ion to the nucleus is higher than the displacement threshold @xmath0 , a carbon atom can leave its initial position to form a metastable defect structure on a sub - picosecond timescale .",
    "such events are called knock - on displacements . for highly anisotropic layered carbon materials",
    "the threshold of the off - plane displacement is @xmath1@xmath215 - 20  ev @xcite while a creation of defect due to the in - plane knock - on collision requires higher transferred energies , @xmath3@xmath430  ev .",
    "possible defects produced by radiation damage include separated and intimate @xcite pairs of interstitial atoms and vacancies , and in - plane topological defects involving non - sixmembered rings , e.g. stone - wales defect.@xcite the existence of defects in carbon nanostructures has been confirmed by direct observations.@xcite    upon knock - on events a large amount of energy is transferred to only a few degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting defect structures formed on a picosecond timescale depend on the magnitude and on the direction of the transferred momentum and determine the fate of the system at longer timescales . therefore gaining control over the early stages of defect formation by tuning the irradiation conditions will make the paradigm of the defect - assisted engineering feasible .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations performed with empirical potentials @xcite or tight - binding models @xcite have been used for the studies of radiation damage of various carbon materials .    in this work ,",
    "we report a _ systematic first principles _ study of the early stages of radiation damage of graphite , a general model for closely related layered carbon nanostructures .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec : methods ] we provide a description of the computational methods used in this work .",
    "the observed defect structures , mechanisms of their formation , and practical implications are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] briefly concludes our work .",

    "the periodic model system consists of a unit cell with 108 carbon atoms , which contains two graphene sheets with stacking abab .",
    "the dimension of the unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the graphene planes was fixed to 6.7    in accordance with the experimental inter - layer distance 3.35  .@xcite this distance shows only weak variation among different layered carbon nanostructures .",
    "our computational methodology is based on density functional theory ( dft ) , which lacks a correct description of weak van der waals interactions between graphene planes . however , by fixing the unit cell dimension in the direction perpendicular to the graphene planes we provide a realistic description of layered carbon nanostructures without any explicit inclusion of van der waals forces .",
    "the in - plane distance between two periodic images is 12.7   which is large enough to ensure localization of the defect within the unit cell .",

    "the simulations were performed within the spin - unrestricted formulation of dft starting from an initial guess asymmetric with respect to the spin components .",
    "such a starting configuration is required in order to ensure a broken - symmetry path of bond breaking events.@xcite the first 100  fs of each md simulation were performed using the born - oppenheimer scheme .",
    "the md timestep was set to 0.5  fs . in our simulations",
    "we observed that during the first 100  fs the transferred kinetic energy was well dissipated over the entire system .",
    "the initial simulation was followed by a car - parrinello simulation @xcite carried out using a nos - hoover thermostat @xcite ( 350  k ) until a stable defect structure was reached ( about 1  ps ) .",
    "this thermal coupling methodology provides a realistic description of the excess kinetic energy dissipation after knock - on collisions of reasonably low transferred energies .",
    "the car - parrinello equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 0.1  fs using a fictitious electron mass of 400  a.u .",
    "finally , the obtained defect structures were relaxed by slow annealing of both ionic and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the formation energies were evaluated using the ` siesta ` code @xcite by relaxing the ionic coordinates and the in - plane cell dimensions . the same norm - conserving pseudopotentials and density functional as in the plane wave calculations together with an optimized double-@xmath12 plus polarization function ( dzp ) basis set were used . a 2@xmath132@xmath132 k - point grid ( including the @xmath14 point )",

    "we first discuss the simulation results for the off - plane displacements ( @xmath7@xmath8@xmath17 ) of carbon atoms in inequivalent positions @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the outcomes can be divided into four major classes : ( i ) no defect formation due to insufficient transferred momentum or due to instantaneous recombination of the recoil atom with the vacancy ( n ) ; ( ii ) separated interstitial - vacancy pairs ( i - v ) ; ( iii ) intimate interstitial - vacancy pairs ( iiv ) ; ( iv ) displacement cascades ( c ) in which the recoil atom is able to displace other atoms in the lattice .",
    "the latter case can be viewed as a series of elementary events of types ( i)(iii ) .",

    "the formation energies are given in parentheses .",
    "the values given for interstitial defects refer to the formation energies of corresponding frenkel pairs . for iiv defects",
    "the created vacancy is situated in the upper graphene layer.,width=325 ]    the formation of well - separated frenkel pairs was observed for atoms in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 positions at @xmath6@xmath1825  ev .",
    "surprisingly , the interstitial defects were produced only in the form of a symmetric `` dumbell '' structure ( i@xmath19 ) @xcite where the two carbon atoms are symmetrically displaced from the graphene plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eps1 ] , top ) . despite the highly distorted coordination sphere of these atoms , the c  c distance of 1.58    is close to the one of a typical @xmath20 bond .",
    "the core atomic structure is the same as for the [ 1.1.1]propellane molecule for which a very similar c  c bond length ( 1.60@xmath210.02   ) has been observed experimentally.@xcite no single off - plane recoil led to the `` bridge '' structure ( i@xmath22 ) @xcite with the interstitial atom situated between two graphene planes .",
    "the formation energy of i@xmath19 ( @xmath23=14.3  ev , the value refers to the formation energy of the corresponding i - v pair ) is only 0.5  ev lower than the one of i@xmath22 ( @xmath23=14.8  ev ) where the `` bridge '' interstitial defect is bonded only to the neighbor atom in the same layer . in this case",
    ", a steric repulsion with the opposite graphene layer contributes to the destabilization of the i@xmath22 defect",
    ". however , bonding to the opposite layer leads to more stable shared interstitial defect structures.@xcite in the ylid ( @xmath23=14.1  ev ) and spiro ( @xmath23=13.1  ev ) configurations , the shared interstitial atom is additionally bound to one and , respectively , to two carbon atoms of the adjacent layer .",
    "these structures have not been observed in our md simulations .",
    "the observed preference for the i@xmath19 configuration in graphite may have the following origin . in the `` dumbell '' configuration the recoil atom is able to transfer its excess kinetic energy to the other atoms more efficiently than in the case of the `` bridge '' configuration . at the same time",
    ", the formation of shared interstitials requires the improbable collective motion of a number of atoms in the two adjacent graphene layers in the direction of the recoil atom .",
    "this explains the observed high probability for the formation of the i@xmath19 defect structure in the early stages of the radiation - induced defect formation .",
    "for the isolated graphene sheet , i@xmath22 is 0.2  ev more stable than i@xmath19 due to the absence of the steric repulsion with the adjacent graphene layer . in curved graphenic structures , like carbon nanotubes , the `` bridge '' interstitial defect undergoes further stabilization .",
    "our first principles calculations predict that the transition from the defect structure i@xmath19 to the structure i@xmath22 in graphite is characterized by an activation barrier of 0.9  ev .",
    "the `` dumbell '' interstitial can also be viewed as a stable intermediate of the self - diffusion process in graphite along the @xmath24-axis , occurring via the substitution of a carbon atom in the graphene layer.@xcite the energy diagram for the diffusion process along the @xmath24-axis is shown in figure  [ fig : eps4 ] .     the scheme of the self - diffusion process in graphite along the @xmath24-axis .",

    "the relative energies of local minima and transition states are shown.,width=325 ]    formation of intimate interstitial - vacancy pairs ( iiv ) requires lower transferred kinetic energies . at @xmath6=20  ev we observed the formation of two low energy iiv pairs , iiv@xmath22 ( @xmath23=10.5  ev ) and iiv@xmath19 ( @xmath23=11.0  ev ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eps1 ] , bottom ) . the displaced atom bridges the defect vacancy with two , respectively , three neighbor atoms in the opposite layer , which undergo rehybridization .",
    "a fine scan of the transferred momentum space indicates a @xmath0 value of 18  ev for graphite , in agreement with other reported values.@xcite as a consequence , the use of a particle beam energy capable of achieving a maximum kinetic energy transfer just above @xmath0 will _ selectively _ create iiv defects .",
    "this value for @xmath0 would correspond to the maximum kinetic energy transferred by an electron beam of 90  kev.@xcite in the case of carbon nanotubes , @xmath0 is expected to be lower due to curvature effects.@xcite this proves the crucial role of the iiv defects in the reinforcement of carbon nanotube bundles @xcite produced by 80  kev electron irradiation .",
    "our results suggest the optimal conditions for the modification of mechanic and electronic properties of carbon - based layered nanostructures by means of the formation of iiv defects . for graphite and closely related nanostructures , electron beam acceleration voltages of 90110",
    "kv can be used .",
    "such modifications are non - destructive since iiv defects tend to self - recombine without producing extensive damage of the nanostructure.@xcite this is also supported by the fact that the barriers for iiv@xmath22 defect recombination @xcite and for the transformation of iiv@xmath22 into iiv@xmath19 ( 0.9  ev in this study ) lie below the formation energies of i - v pairs .",
    "our computed formation energy for the previously proposed iiv@xmath22 structure @xcite is in good agreement with the values reported in other studies.@xcite however , md simulations on a longer time scale indicate that the asymmetric iiv@xmath22 defect in graphite is not stable against recombination at 350  k if the shear of neighboring graphite layers is allowed . by contrast , the symmetric iiv@xmath19 defect is stable throughout our md simulations .",
    "two other intimate frenkel pairs , iiv@xmath25 ( @xmath23=11.6  ev ) and iiv@xmath26 ( @xmath23=12.2  ev ) have been obtained upon off - plane recoils caused by larger transferred momenta . in both structures",
    "the displaced carbon atom is linked to two carbon atoms in its host layer and one atom in the neighboring layer .",
    "it is notable that the formation of iiv defects has been observed _ only _ upon recoil of the @xmath16 carbon atom .",
    "we explain this observation by the large probability of instantaneous recombination of the @xmath15 atom recoils due to the local arrangement of atoms in the adjacent layer .",

    "the mechanism of its formation involves the cyclic permutation of three carbon atoms occurring during the first 100  fs after the knock - on collision ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eps2 ] , top ) . a much lower activation barrier of @xmath210  ev is required when the sw defect is formed upon simultaneous in - plane rotation of two neighboring carbon atoms.@xcite however , this mechanism _ can not _ be realized upon knock - on collisions because in this case the kinetic energy is transferred to a single atom .",
    "irradiation of graphene - based materials , using an electron beam of energy just above 150  kev and oriented along the graphene plane , will result in an _ increase _ of yield of sw defects .",
    "this can be used for tuning electronic properties of materials.@xcite however , because of the high energy transfer required for their formation , sw defects will be accompanied by the formation of frenkel pairs , which form upon low energy ( @xmath6@xmath2830  ev ) off - plane recoils .    for @xmath6@xmath2930  ev two possible general mechanisms of defect formation have been identified .",
    "the first one involves the formation of strained structures containing non - sixmembered rings , which have formation energies higher than the formation energy of the sw defect .",
    "two such structures , 7 - 5 - 4 - 8 ( @xmath23=11.3  ev ) and 5 - 7 - 7 - 4 - 4 - 9 ( @xmath23=12.2  ev ) have been observed in our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eps2 ] , bottom ) .",
    "the second mechanism involves the expulsion of one carbon atom from the graphene plane shortly after the collision . in this case",
    "interstitial - vacancy pairs are formed .",

    "the defect is localized in the graphene layer where the collision took place . on the contrary , the displaced carbon atom in the iiv@xmath31 structure bridges three atoms of its host layer with one of the neighboring layers .",
    "the formation energies of all six iiv structures found in our simulations lie within a narrow interval of 2.5  ev , and they are all below the formation energies of separated i - v pairs",
    ". these defects should be stable at long time scales and at moderate temperatures .",
