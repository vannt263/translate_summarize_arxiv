    "computation of many interior eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large sparse symmetric ( or hermitian ) matrix is a frequent task required for electronic structure calculations in quantum chemistry , material science , and physics .",
    "starting from the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hamilton operator of electrons in the material under consideration , one is interested in all solutions of this equation with energies @xmath4 within a small window inside of the spectrum of @xmath3 .",
    "interior eigenvalues are required because electrical or optical material properties are largely determined by the electronic states in the vicinity of the fermi energy , which separates the occupied from the unoccupied electron states .",
    "the width of the energy window is given by , e.g. , the temperature or the magnitude of an applied electric voltage .",
    "recently , the computation of interior eigenvalues has gained new thrust from the fabrication of graphene  @xcite and topological insulator  @xcite materials , which exhibit unconventional electron states that differ from those observed in traditional semiconductors or metals . in graphene ,",
    "electrons at the fermi level follow a linear dispersion reminiscent of relativistic dirac fermions , while the topologically protected surface states of topological insulators are natural candidates for quantum computing and quantum information storage . because the properties of graphene and topological insulator devices depend directly on such electron states close to the center of the spectrum , their modeling and design requires the solution of ever larger interior eigenvalue problems  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the rapidly developing demands on the application side we introduce in this paper a high - performance implementation of chebyshev filter diagonalization ( chebfd ) , a straightforward scheme for interior eigenvalue computations based on polynomial filter functions .",
    "chebfd has a lot in common with the kernel polynomial method ( kpm )  @xcite and is equally well suited for large - scale computations  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to show that a well - implemented chebfd algorithm can be turned into a powerful tool for the computation of many interior eigenvalues of very large sparse matrices .",
    "here we include results for the computation of @xmath5 central eigenvalues of a @xmath1-dimensional topological insulator matrix on @xmath6 nodes of the federal supercomputer system `` supermuc '' at lrz garching , at @xmath7 tflop / s sustained performance .",
    "chebfd is , to our knowledge , presently the only approach that can solve interior eigenvalue problems at this scale .",
    "while the present paper focuses on high - performance applications of chebfd , and less on algorithmic improvements , we will discuss its theoretical foundations in considerable detail .",
    "we will analyze especially how the algorithmic efficiency of polynomial filtering depends on the number of search vectors in the computation , and not only on the quality of the filter polynomials .",
    "using a larger search space and lower filter polynomial degree can improve convergence significantly .",
    "conceptually , chebfd is a massively parallel block algorithm with corresponding demands on computational resources , which makes performance engineering mandatory .",
    "one should note that the use of chebyshev filter polynomials has a long tradition in the solution of linear systems  @xcite , as a restarting technique for ( krylov ) subspace iterations  @xcite , and for the computation of extreme and interior eigenvalues in quantum chemistry applications  @xcite .",
    "the latter methods can be divided roughly into two classes : methods which are based ",
    "explicitly or implicitly  on time propagation of a wave function with chebyshev techniques and ( re-)construction of eigenstates from fourier inversion of the computed time signal ( as , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and methods that use chebyshev filters for iterated subspace projection steps ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent contribution ) .",
    "chebfd belongs to the latter class of methods .    the rationale behind the use of polynomial filters in chebfd instead of rational filter functions ( as , e.g. , in feast  @xcite or the cirr method  @xcite ) or of spectral transformations of the eigenvalue problem  @xcite is that sparse matrix factorization is not feasible for the very large matrices in our target applications .",
    "this prevents the use of direct solvers such as pardiso  @xcite or ilupack  @xcite , which have been used successfully for , e.g. , anderson localization  @xcite . in some applications",
    "the matrix is not even stored explicitly but constructed ` on - the - fly '  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that the only feasible sparse matrix operation in chebfd is sparse matrix vector multiplication ( spmvm ) .    if a matrix @xmath3 is accessed exclusively through spmvms the only expressions that can be evaluated effectively are polynomials",
    "@xmath8 \\vec v$ ] of @xmath3 applied to a vector @xmath9 .",
    "note that in such a situation also the use of iterative linear solvers would result in a polynomial expression .",
    "therefore , we design and analyze the chebfd algorithm entirely in terms of polynomial filters ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent work on polynomial filters ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : poly ] we describe the construction of chebyshev filter polynomials , analyze the convergence of polynomial filtering as used in chebfd , and obtain practical rules for the choice of the free algorithmic parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chebfd ] we introduce the basic chebfd scheme and test the algorithm with a few numerical experiments . in sec .

    "the symmetric situation @xmath18 is especially challenging .",

    "numerical convergence is achieved if the residual of every eigenpair satisfies @xmath22 for a specified accuracy goal @xmath23 , and all eigenpairs from the target interval are found . in current applications",
    "the target interval typically contains up to a few hundred eigenvalues of @xmath3 , which itself has dimension @xmath24 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath19 is normally not known prior to the computation , but can be estimated from the density of states ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : optimal ] ) .    the optimal filter function for the above problem is the rectangular window function @xmath25 , with the heaviside function @xmath26 .",

    "the eigenpairs in the target interval can then be obtained as follows : start with sufficiently many ( random ) search vectors @xmath30 , for @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and compute the filtered vectors @xmath33 \\vec x_k $ ] .",
    "the vectors @xmath34 lie in the target space , but if @xmath35 they are linearly dependent .",
    "orthogonalization of the @xmath34 with a rank - revealing technique gives a basis . in the chebfd scheme of sec .",
    "[ sec : chebfd ] the probability is reduced even further by adding new vectors after each orthogonalization step . ] of the target space .",
    "the wanted eigenpairs are the rayleigh - ritz pairs of @xmath3 in this subspace basis .",
    "of course , a rectangular window function @xmath36 can not be represented exactly by a polynomial @xmath37 .",
    "the first step in polynomial filtering thus is the construction of a good polynomial approximation to @xmath36 .",
    "theoretical arguments  @xcite and numerical evidence ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : chebfd ] ) suggest that convergence improves with high - order polynomial approximations .",
    "since general optimization or fitting techniques become difficult to use for polynomials of high degree , we construct the filter polynomials from chebyshev expansions and kernel polynomials .",
    "this is motivated by our previous experience with the kpm  @xcite .",
    "the construction of filter polynomials is based on the chebyshev expansion @xmath38 of @xmath36 on an interval @xmath13 $ ] that contains the spectrum of @xmath3 ( see fig .  [",

    "truncation of the infinite series   leads to a polynomial approximation to @xmath36 , which , however , suffers from gibbs oscillations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : filters ] ) .",
    "the solution to the gibbs phenomenon exploited in , e.g. , kpm is to include suitable kernel damping factors @xmath49 in the expansion .",
    "this gives the polynomial approximation @xmath50 of degree @xmath51 .",
    "three examples for the kernel coefficients @xmath49 are given in table  [ tab : kernel ] , including the jackson kernel  @xcite known from kpm  @xcite .",
    "the resulting approximations to @xmath36 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : filters ] . in chebfd",
    "we will use the lanczos kernel with @xmath52 , which tends to give faster convergence than the other choices .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      the good scalability and high performance of our chebfd implementation allows us to deal with the very large matrices that arise in the theoretical modeling of realistic systems . to illustrate the physics that becomes accessible through large - scale interior eigenvalue computations we consider the example of gate - defined quantum dots in a topological insulator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dot1 ] ) , a primary example for the functionalization of topological materials .    in this example a finite gate potential is tuned to a value ( @xmath54 ) such that the wave functions of the innermost eigenstates , i.e. , those located at the fermi energy , are concentrated in the circular gate regions .",
    "minimal changes of the gate potential can lead to large changes of the wave functions , which gives rise to a transistor effect that allows for the rapid switching between an ` on ' and an ` off ' state .",
    "while this effect can be studied already for small systems , or is even accessible to analytical treatment due to the high symmetry of the situation , the modeling of realistic systems requires the incorporation of disorder at the microscopic level , which results either from material imperfections or deliberate doping with impurity atoms .",
    "the natural question then is how disorder modifies the transistor effect . to answer this question the interior eigenstates",
    "must now be computed numerically , and large system sizes are required to correctly describe the effect of the microscopic disorder on the mesoscopic quantum dot wave functions .",
    "an example for such a computation with chebfd is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dot2 ] . eigenstates close to the fermi energy are still concentrated in the gate regions , although the circular shapes visible in the wave function from fig .",
    "[ fig : dot1 ] are washed out by disorder .",
    "interestingly , the two nearby eigenstates shown in the picture are concentrated in different gate regions , which is possible because disorder breaks the perfect square symmetry of the arrangement .",
    "therefore , disorder can induce a new transistor effect , where a small gate potential switches an electric current between different sides of the sample .",
    "full exploration of this effect certainly requires more realistic modeling of the situation .",
    "as the present examples demonstrate , chebfd can become a relevant computational tool for such explorations .    , i.e. , the matrix dimension is @xmath55 , with disorder @xmath56 .",

    "polynomial filtering techniques such as the chebfd scheme examined in the present paper are powerful tools for large - scale computations of many interior eigenvalues of sparse symmetric matrices .",
    "these techniques combine two aspects . on the one hand",
    ", they use polynomial filter functions to damp out eigenvector contributions outside of the target interval .",
    "polynomial filters allow for simple evaluation through spmvm , and are thus applicable to large matrices .",
    "on the other hand , these techniques rely on large search spaces , which can lead to fast convergence also for moderate quality of the polynomial filters .",
    "chebfd is a straightforward implementation of polynomial filtering . despite its algorithmic simplicity , chebfd is well suited for large - scale computations , such as the determination of the @xmath0 central eigenpairs of a @xmath1-dimensional matrix presented here . to our knowledge",
    "presently no other method is capable of computations at this scale .",
    "these promising results indicate that chebfd can become a viable tool for electronic structure calculations in quantum chemistry and physics , and for research into modern topological materials .",
    "the present chebfd scheme can be refined along several directions .",
    "first , the construction of better polynomial filters could improve convergence .",
    "second , adaptive schemes that adjust the polynomial degree and the number of search vectors according to the dos , which can be computed with increasing accuracy in the course of the iteration , might prove useful .",
    "third , ritz values should be replaced by harmonic ritz values in the computation , together with an improved convergence criterion and locking of converged eigenpairs .",
    "note , however , that our theoretical analysis of chebfd shows that none of these improvements is truly crucial for the ( fast ) convergence of polynomial filtering : the most important aspect is the `` overpopulation '' of the target space with search vectors , i.e. , the use of a sufficiently large search space .",
    "a more radical alternative to chebfd is the replacement of polynomial filters by rational functions as , e.g. , in the feast and cirr methods . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", rational functions always lead to better convergence",
    ". however , evaluation of rational functions of sparse matrices is non - trivial .",
    "standard iterative solvers require too many additional spmvms to be competitive with polynomial filters , unless they can exploit additional structural or spectral properties of the matrix  @xcite . at present",
    "it is not clear whether non - polynomial filter functions can succeed in large - scale problems of the size reported here .",
    "this question is currently under investigation .",
    "the chebfd algorithm implemented and investigated in the present work should be of particular interest to physicists and chemists who increasingly require high - performance tools for the computation of interior eigenvalues in present and future research applications .",
