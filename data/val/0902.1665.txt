    "present work is the follow - up on part i of this paper @xcite , discussing a relatively simple model capable of describing the behavior of a massive structure until the point of  localized failure .",
    "the model contains all the ingredients for taking into account both the  diffuse damage mechanism , which leads to the appearance of microcracks , as well as  the  failure process characterized by the propagation of macrocracks .",
    "perhaps the most important advantage of the proposed model is the fact that all its parameters have a clear physical interpretation and can be straightforwardly visualized in terms of the shape of a stress - strain diagram .",
    "in addition , influence of each parameter is dominant only for a specific , easily recognizable , stages of material behavior .",
    "this kind of a priori knowledge has a potential to greatly simplify the model calibration and will be systematically used throughout the  paper .",
    "in part ii of this paper , we discuss the identification of the model parameters from experimental measurements made on a structural level . generally speaking , the complexity of the identification procedure is determined by the choice of experimental setup . solely from the identification point of view , the simplest experiment to execute is the uniaxial tensile test . in this case",
    ", the strain field stays mostly homogeneous during the whole procedure and the global response represented by the load - displacement diagram is very similar to the stress - strain curve for one material point ; see section [ tensile ] for more details .",
    "the  model parameters can be then directly determined from the shape of the load - displacement curve .",
    "such a uniform loading is , however , very difficult if not impossible to impose in a laboratory test , especially for quasi - brittle materials .",
    "therefore , other tests are often used in  experimental practice .    the three - point bending test , in particular ,",
    "is considered to be much simpler to perform and its results are well - reproducible .",
    "therefore , we focus on the identification procedure for the proposed model parameters directly from results of three - point bending test .",
    "main difficulty is in this case imposed by heterogeneity of the stress and the strain fields , which is present since the very start of the experiment .",
    "the macro - scale measurements provide the load - deflection curve that integrates data from different parts of the specimen experiencing different regimes of ( in)elastic behavior .",
    "for that reason , the possibility of a simple determination of model parameters from load - deflection curve is lost and an advanced calibration procedure needs to be applied .    to take advantage of the model specific structure ,",
    "already mentioned above , the identification procedure should be divided into three sequential stages discussed in detail in  section  [ tpb ] . from the algorithmic point of view",
    ", the material calibration can then be understood as  a  sequential optimization problem .",
    "such approach has two main advantages : first , solving three simpler identification steps in a batch form is typically much more efficient then the full - scale problem ; second , it allows to use only a subset of simulations for initial stages of identification process .",
    "a variety of techniques is available to identify material parameters via optimization methods , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "the gradient - based methods are usually considered to be the most computationally efficient optimization algorithms available and  as  such have been successfully used in a variety of identification problems , e.g. @xcite . for the  current model , however , analytic determination of sensitivities is fairly difficult , mainly due the history dependency of the model as well as complex interaction of individual parameters .",
    "the accuracy of numerical approximation to the exact sensitivities , on  the  other hand , is driven by the choice of pseudo - time step used in numerical simulations .",
    "clearly , to reduce the computational time , the pseudo - time step should be used as large as possible .",
    "therefore , the response - based objective function will not be smooth and gradient - based methods are unlikely to be very successful .",
    "as an alternative , techniques of soft - computing can be employed for optimization of complex objective functions .",
    "for example , stochastic evolutionary algorithms have been successfully used for solution of identification problems on a level of material point @xcite or  on  a  level of simple structures @xcite . for the current case ,",
    "however , complexity of  the  optimization can be attributed rather to its non - smooth character than to the appearance of multiple optima ; the family of problems where evolutionary algorithms are the most successful methods .",
    "this opens the way to more specialized tools , which deliver higher efficiency when compared to usually time - consuming evolutionary algorithms .",
    "the approach adopted in the present work is based on an adaptive smoothing of the objective function by artificial neural networks  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for alternative ann - based solutions to identification problems ) . in particular , the approximated model is provided by the radial basis function network , described in section  [ rbfn ] , dynamically evolved by  minima located by a real - encoded genetic algorithm , briefly reviewed in section  [ grade ] . the proposed sequential numerical strategy is systematically verified in section  [ results ] with  attention paid to a detailed assessment of the proposed stochastic algorithm reliability .",
    "final remarks and conclusions can be found in section [ conclu ] .",
    "in the present section , we give a brief description of  the model on which the identification procedure is based .",
    "for the readers interested in more details , the complete description of  the  model is given in part i of this paper .",
    "as already mentioned , the proposed model is capable of taking into account two different types of dissipation ( e.g. see @xcite ) :    * a bulk dissipation induced by the appearance of uniformly distributed microcracks .",
    "this bulk dissipation is taken into account by the use of a classical continuum damage model ; * a surface dissipation induced by the development of macrocracks responsible for  the  collapse of the structure . as presented in part",
    "i of this paper , this phase is taken into account by the use of a strong discontinuity model .",
    "the surface dissipation is taken into account by the introduction of a traction / displacement jump relation .",
    "therefore , two different models are involved in the constitutive description : the one associated with the bulk material and the one associated with the displacement discontinuity .",
    "both are built on the same scheme considering the thermodynamics of continuous media and interfaces .",
    "the key points of the construction of each of the two models are summarized in table [ tab : tab_continuum ] and table [ tab : tab_discrete ] .",
    ".main ingredients of the continuum damage model [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have proposed a sound identification procedure for material parameters of the constitutive model for representing the localized failure of massive structures .",
    "the most pertinent conclusions can be stated as follows :    \\i ) the sequential identification approach employed for the uniaxial tensile test can be extended to the three - point bending test .",
    "the resulting algorithm is very straightforward and has a clear link with the structure of the constitutive model .",
    "moreover , each of three stages uses only a part of the test simulation , which leads to substantial computational time savings .",
    "\\ii ) due to the physical insight into the model , it was possible to construct simple objective functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with a high sensitivity to the relevant parameters",
    ". this led to  non - smooth and non - convex objective functions , which were optimized by robust soft - computing methods .",
    "\\iii ) the proposed identification procedure was verified on @xmath6 independent optimization processes executed for each objective function . in the worst case , the reliability of  the  algorithm is @xmath7 due to very small number of objective functions calls set in the termination condition . from our experience with evolutionary algorithms @xcite , such a result is rather satisfactory .",
    "\\iv ) as the result of a sequential character of the identification procedure , the errors in  identified parameters accumulate . therefore , the values need to be determined with higher accuracy then usually required in applications ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and achievable by neural network - based inverse analysis @xcite .",
    "\\v ) the major difficulty of the proposed methods is to properly identify the three stages of structural behavior . from the point of view of method verification , where the reference load - deflection diagram is not noisy ,",
    "the problem was successfully resolved . to fully accept the procedure",
    ", however , the experimental validation of the method appears to be necessary .",
