    "type i x - ray bursts are the most frequent types of thermonuclear stellar explosions in the galaxy . as well , they rank third after supernovae and classical novae in terms of total energy output in a single event , for phenomena observed in the galaxy .",
    "ninety - six galactic low - mass x - ray binary systems exhibiting such bursting behaviour have been discovered to datejeanz / bursterlist.html for a list of known galactic bursting sources . ] .",
    "x - ray bursts were discovered in 1975 @xcite through observations made with the astronomische nederlandse satelliet @xcite of a previously known x - ray source , 4u 1820 - 30 . while a similar event had been observed in 1969 from the source cen x-4 using the vela 5b satellite @xcite",
    ", the authors did not relate the observed features to a new , distinct type of emission .",
    "consequently , that source was not associated with what we now call type i x - ray bursts until 1976 @xcite . at a distance of @xmath01  kpc @xcite ,",
    "cen x-4 is the nearest - known x - ray bursting source @xcite and has yielded the brightest x - ray burst ever recorded ( @xmath060  crab erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 in the 210 kev band.]@xcite ) .",
    "these initial , pioneering discoveries were soon followed by the identification of more bursters . while most x - ray satellites have detected x - ray bursts , great advances in the field were made through observations by exosat ( operating from 1983 to 1986@xcite ) , bepposax ( operatiing from 1996 to 2003@xcite ) , and the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte , operating from 1995 to 2012 @xcite ) .",
    "rxte , with its large collecting area and capability for high temporal resolution x - ray analysis , has observed more than 1000 bursts from about 50 sources @xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery of x - ray bursting sources , it was proposed that the explosions could be powered by thermonuclear runaways on the surface of accreting neutron stars @xcite ( see section [ mech ] ) .",
    "the discovery of the rapid burster in 1976 @xcite , with burst recurrence times as short as 10 s , complicated matters .",
    "the quick succession of flashes observed from this source seemed incompatible with the proposed mechanism , and moreover , did not match the general pattern shown by the other bursting sources .",
    "a classification of type i and type ii bursts was therefore established @xcite , the former associated with thermonuclear flashes and the latter linked to accretion instabilities .",
    "the rapid burster is one of only two known sources showing type ii bursts , together with the bursting pulsar ( gro 1744 - 28 ) ; furthermore , the rapid burster is the only source giving both type i and type ii x - ray bursts@xcite .",
    "type i bursts display a spectral softening during the burst tail , reflecting a decrease in the effective temperature and thus the cooling of the neutron star atmosphere .",
    "typically , light curve rise times range between @xmath01 and @xmath010 seconds and decay times range between @xmath010 seconds and several minutes .",
    "recurrence times may vary between roughly one and several hours .",
    "in contrast , type ii bursts exhibit a constant temperature for the duration of the burst , which can range from @xmath02 s to @xmath0700 s , with intervals between bursts from @xmath07 s to @xmath01 hr .",
    "more recently , other varieties of x - ray bursts of longer duration have been discovered .",
    "superbursts , first identified from the source 4u 1735 - 444 by cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xcite , have been observed in about 10% of all bursters .",
    "they are characterized by light curves with exponential - like decay times of several hours and include an extreme case , ks 1731260 , that lasted for about 12 hours @xcite .",
    "roughly 1000 times more energetic than a typical x - ray burst ( superbursts release @xmath0 10@xmath3 erg per burst ) , superbursts have much longer recurrence times of the order of a year . the mechanism for these phenomena",
    "is thought to involve the unstable burning of carbon @xcite .",
    "as well , bursts intermediate in both energy ( releasing @xmath0 10@xmath4 erg ) and duration ( @xmath0 30 min ) to typical type i x - ray bursts and superbursts have been observed @xcite . these are thought to result from thermonuclear ignition within a layer of pure helium @xcite , although other explanations may also be viable @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss these bursts of longer duration or type ii bursts further .",
    "x - ray bursts ( xrbs ) occur on the surface of a neutron star belonging to a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "lmxbs are binary systems where a faint , low mass ( m @xmath5 1 m@xmath6 ) main sequence or red giant star transfers material onto a neutron star or black hole . the transferred matter is typically enriched in h , he or both h and he .",
    "furthermore , these mass transfer episodes are driven by roche - lobe overflows , leading to the buildup of an accretion disk that surrounds the compact object .",
    "( in contrast to lmxbs , high - mass x - ray binaries consist of a compact object capturing a fraction of the stellar wind from a high - mass companion star . )",
    "the maximum mass accretion rate is assumed to be set by the eddington limit corresponds to the maximum luminosity emitted by a stellar object for which the radiation pressure balances the gravitational attraction . for higher luminosities , the energy exceeding the eddington limit generates a radiation - driven wind . in the case of accreting sources , the eddington limit for the luminosity",
    "also puts a limit on the accretion rate @xmath7 .",
    "] , which for accretion of h - rich material onto a 1.4 m@xmath6 neutron star is @xmath8",
    "m@xmath6 yr@xmath1 .",
    "xrb sources often have short orbital periods , in the range of 0.2  15 hr ; notable exceptions include cir x-1 , gx 13 + 1 and cyg x-2 , with @xmath9 = 398.4 hr , 592.8 hr and 236.2 hr , respectively .",
    "as accretion proceeds onto the surface of the neutron star , the transferred material is gradually compressed to large densities and becomes degenerate .",
    "this compression also heats the envelope , creating conditions favourable to the ignition of the fuel through nuclear reactions .",
    "since the envelope is initially degenerate , it can not expand to accommodate the energy released through the nuclear processes . as a result , both the temperature and nuclear energy generation rate in the envelope increase .",
    "this drives a thermonuclear runaway which results in an xrb .",
    "note that the accreted envelope above the neutron star is only weakly degenerate ; that is , the degeneracy is lifted as the temperature increases at early times .",
    "for example , for a neutron star accreting fuel with @xmath10=0.5 , degeneracy is lifted ( @xmath11 @xmath0 @xmath12 ) as the temperature exceeds roughly 0.3 gk .",
    "however , the extreme ejection velocities required for material to escape from a neutron star are never achieved by the moderate amount of energy released by nuclear reactions . consequently neither appreciable mass ejection nor substantial envelope expansion results .    between individual bursts ,",
    "the bulk of the observed , accretion - powered , x - ray flux arises from the hottest and innermost regions of the accretion disk .",
    "this persistent emission is not very sensitive to the nature of the compact object .",
    "hence , the detection of thermonuclear x - ray bursts from a lmxb is actually the most reliable indicator of the presence of a neutron star as opposed to a black hole .",
    "owing to the novel associated nucleosynthesis patterns , as well as the corresponding interest of experimentalists in measuring the different interactions involved , we will now focus on mixed h / he accretors throughout ( see e.g. , refs . @xcite for sources exhibiting bursts in he - rich environments ) . during the thermonuclear runaway , a h /",
    "he - rich envelope is transformed to matter strongly enriched in heavier nuclei via the @xmath13@xmath14-process and the @xmath15-process .",
    "these two processes involve proton- or @xmath13-particle induced reactions on stable and radioactive nuclei , interspersed by occasional @xmath16-decays , depending on the nuclear structure of the nuclide reached by the abundance flow .",
    "since the peak temperatures reached during the thermonuclear runaway may exceed 1 gk , many different nuclear interactions are likely to occur during the xrb .    in this review",
    "we begin by discussing observable features of type i xrbs , highlighting characteristics in these phenomena that may depend upon nucleosynthesis .",
    "we then focus upon treatments that have been used to model xrbs and examine how the predictions of these calculations compare to one another and to observations .",
    "next , we explain the roles of both theoretical and experimental nuclear physics in models of xrbs , and discuss nuclear physics uncertainties that either have been or remain to be addressed to better constrain model predictions .",
    "we conclude with suggestions to guide future observational , theoretical and experimental nuclear physics efforts to clarify nucleosynthesis in type i xrbs .",
    "most lmxbs are transient x - ray sources , indicating that the rate of accretion from the disk onto the compact object is not constant .",
    "lmxbs are typically discovered during periods of enhanced accretion rate , with persistent luminosities in the range 0.0010.1 @xmath17 .",
    "these periods are known as outbursts , and each may last for a few weeks or months . after an outburst the source returns to quiescence , disappearing from the x - ray sky for several months or decades .",
    "type i x - ray bursts typically occur during outbursts , when the accretion rate is high enough to supply sufficient fuel for a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "note , however , that some xrbs have been detected from lmxbs in apparent quiescence @xcite .",
    "type i x - ray bursts appear as short flashes on top of the persistent , accretion - powered emission .",
    "examples of light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ lcs ] . depending upon the source",
    ", bursts may occur either quite regularly ( the most regular burster being gs 1826 - 24 ) or follow a highly variable and irregular pattern . if the burst recurrence time is well determined , the ratio of the integrated energy released between x - ray bursts to the integrated energy released during the burst defines the dimensionless @xmath13 parameter . assuming that all accreted fuel is burned during the burst , @xmath13 should then correspond to the ratio of energies , per unit mass , liberated via accretion and thermonuclear burning . indeed , observed ratios of time - integrated persistent and burst fluxes ( @xmath18 @xcite ) match estimates based on the gravitational potential energy released by matter falling onto a neutron star during accretion ( @xmath19 mev per nucleon ) and the nuclear energy released during a burst ( @xmath20 mev per nucleon , for fuel of solar composition ) .",
    "these observations are also in agreement with detailed model calculations ( see section [ modresults ] ) .",
    "in general , observations of x - ray bursts use detectors with medium to high time resolution .",
    "for example , the pca instrument onboard rxte could measure light curves with a time resolution of 1 @xmath21s over an energy range of 260 kev , while the epic - pn instrument onboard the xmm - newton observatory @xcite has a time resolution of 30 @xmath21s over an energy range of 0.110 kev . these detectors also have medium to high spectral resolution , from @xmath22 for imaging cameras like epic , up to @xmath23 for spectrometers .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain time - resolved spectroscopy of x - ray bursts , which shows that during the entire burst the source spectral energy distribution is usually well approximated by a blackbody spectrum ( but see section [ pre ] ) . from the blackbody fit to the observed spectra , the colour ( or blackbody ) temperature @xmath24 and the bolometric flux @xmath25 ( rate of energy emission per unit area over the whole energy spectrum ) are obtained .",
    "if one assumes isotropic emission from a spherical surface , the radius @xmath26 of the emitting object ( as observed at infinity ) can then be determined using    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath29 is the distance from the observer to the x - ray burster , @xmath30 is the mass of the neutron star and @xmath31 is the colour correction factor ( see section [ pre ] ) .",
    "the gravitational redshift @xmath32 can be expressed as @xmath33 , which for a typical neutron star of @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 km is @xmath37 .",
    "many x - ray bursters are located in globular clusters with well - determined distances .",
    "measurements of radii of the emitting surface of x - ray bursters indicate values around 10  km@xcite .",
    "studies of the blackbody temperature evolution during xrbs show an initial increase in temperature during the increase in flux from the burst , namely , when thermonuclear burning occurs .",
    "this is followed by the cooling of the photosphere during the tail of the burst .",
    "this evolution occurs with a constant emitting area , that is , without significant expansion of the neutron star envelope ( except in the particular cases with photospheric radius expansion , see section [ pre ] ) .",
    "in general , the persistent x - ray flux @xmath38 between x - ray bursts is taken as an indicator of the accretion rate @xmath39 , as @xcite @xmath40    the quantity @xmath41 is a correction that must be made to convert the detected x - ray flux @xmath38 to the bolometric flux @xmath25 .",
    "since x - ray bursts are powered by the fuel accumulated between bursts , it is expected that the burst rate increases with increasing persistent flux , i.e. , if material piles up faster , less time is needed to accumulate sufficient fuel for a burst .",
    "indeed the behaviour of some bursters is in accord with this expectation ( see e.g. , fig . 1 in ref .",
    "however , in several cases , the recurrence rate instead decreases as the persistent emission increases @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that he is burning between bursts @xcite , that the local accretion rate is actually decreasing in spite of an increase in the total accretion rate @xcite , or that the persistent emission is in fact not a reliable indicator of the accretion rate .",
    "observational characteristics of x - ray bursting sources , e.g. , time between bursts , rise time of the light curve , burst duration , or total energy emitted , depend on various parameters such as the accretion rate , the fuel composition or the neutron star spin .",

    "the exact mass - accretion rate boundaries for the different regimes are still under investigation through detailed models . for example , for accretion of metal - deficient matter ,",
    "lower values for the mass - accretion rates at the transition between the different ignition regimes have been obtained , narrowing the predicted regime for pure he - burning @xcite . as well , recent simulations@xcite predict that unstable burning persists for accretion rates higher than those inferred from observational constraints , calling into question other assumptions in the models ( e.g. , the composition of the accreted material ) .    since one source may evolve through different accretion rates during an outburst , in principle the different burning regimes could be observed in the same source . in several bursters ,",
    "the transitions between burning regimes have nicely shown up through the observation of changes in burst durations@xcite , but exceptions are abundant .",

    "i x - ray bursts , the luminosity reaches the eddington limit and causes the expansion of the envelope .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rb ] for a type i burst observed from the rapid burster @xcite .",
    "a first indicator of the expansion of the envelope is a flat - topped light - curve , with a nearly constant bolometric luminosity during the envelope expansion ( top panel ) .",
    "confirmation of the expansion is provided by time - resolved spectroscopy of the constant bolometric luminosity interval , showing the increase ( expansion ) and decrease ( contraction ) of the photospheric radius ( middle panel ) in parallel with the decrease and increase of the effective temperature ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this is followed by the final cooling of the neutron star envelope .",

    "3.4 from ref .",
    "@xcite for examples of both pre and non - pre bursts from a single source .    in some extreme cases ,",
    "the temperature drop is large enough to shift the x - ray emission to energies below the range of sensitivity for typical instruments , causing an apparent double - peak in the detected x - ray flux .",
    "this effect should not be confused with intrinsic double or multiple peaks of the bolometric flux ( see section  [ multipeak ] ) .",
    "observations of these pre bursts probe the still - unknown equation of state ( eos ) of the neutron star through the determination of the neutron star s mass and radius . several models for the eos have been developed , with and without condensates , and some including strange quark matter @xcite . as",
    "each eos predicts a particular relation between the mass and radius of the neutron star , these eos models can be tested using observational constraints on masses and radii . for a pre burst located at a known distance , the neutron star mass can be determined from the observed bolometric luminosity if one assumes that the maximum observed luminosity corresponds to the eddington limit .",
    "the neutron star radius can then be inferred from spectral fits during the cooling tail of the burst if one assumes the emitting area to be the entire neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "a number of details play a role in the determination of the neutron star radius and mass from pre bursts , and the composition of the envelope is a critical element in these calculations . the hydrogen mass fraction x is needed to determine the electron scattering opacity @xmath48 @xmath49g@xmath1 , which in turn is used to determine the eddington limit for the luminosity ( and hence the neutron star mass ) .",
    "in addition , the composition of the atmosphere determines the colour correction factor : the neutron star spectrum is known to differ from a perfect blackbody .",
    "this is because electron scattering in the hot neutron star atmosphere suppresses part of the emission @xcite .",
    "the colour correction factor @xmath50 relates the effective temperature @xmath51 to the colour or blackbody temperature @xmath24 obtained from the spectral fit .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 affects the determination of the emitting area , and hence the neutron star radius , since the emitting area is obtained from the observed flux and temperature .",
    "detailed calculations using atmosphere models @xcite have determined colour correction factors for metallicities up to solar ; the smallest colour correction factors were obtained assuming solar abundances because the absorption edges of fe move the neutron star spectrum closer to a blackbody spectrum . however , in eddington - limited bursts , the photosphere of the neutron star is expected to contain high - metallicity ashes from the thermonuclear burning of h and he deep in the envelope @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with results from hydrodynamic simulations , which show that convective mixing approaches the photosphere when the flux reaches the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "increased atmospheric metallicity would imply more absorption features in the final emerging spectrum and even smaller colour correction factors .",
    "atmosphere model calculations adopting metallicities larger than solar are therefore urgently required to examine the impact of smaller colour correction factors on neutron star mass and radius determinations using pre bursts .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties introduced by the differences between an ideal blackbody spectrum and the actual emission from the neutron star atmosphere during a xrb , the final observed spectrum may be altered by the interaction of the emerging spectrum with the accretion flow or the hot corona surrounding the neutron star ( e.g. , through reflection , partial occultation , comptonization ) .",
    "the resulting uncertainties seem to be sufficiently small @xcite to still allow one to determine neutron star masses and radii with sufficient precision to distinguish between different neutron star eos models .",
    "there are therefore two ways in which the ashes of thermonuclear burning in xrbs may influence the determination of neutron star masses and radii from the observation of pre bursts : via the opacities of the expanding layer ( affecting the value of the assumed eddington limit @xmath17 ) and via the interpretation of the observed spectrum ( through the deviations of the actual atmosphere spectrum from a perfect blackbody ) .",
    "note that other quantities characteristic of neutron stars may also be affected by the composition of burst ashes .",
    "these include thermal @xcite , radiative @xcite , electrical @xcite and mechanical @xcite properties of the neutron star crust , which are important for understanding , e.g. , the evolution of the neutron star magnetic field or the persistent emission between bursts .",
    "oscillations in the light curves of x - ray bursts , with frequencies between about 250 and 600 hz @xcite , were first reported by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite and have now been identified in about 25% of all bursting sources . in bursts from lmxbs , oscillations during the rise time may be consistent with the spreading of a hot spot on a rotating neutron star @xcite .",
    "oscillations during the burst tails , however , exhibit a drift in frequency , increasing by a few hz and approaching an asymptotic value as the burst progresses .",
    "the asymptotic frequency of a burst seems to be a characteristic attribute of an individual source , being stable from burst to burst @xcite .",
    "oscillations have also been observed in bursts from accreting millisecond pulsars @xcite , at frequencies corresponding to the known spin frequencies and with no noticeable drift during the burst tails @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a confined radiating region would be the most straightforward way to account for the oscillations , although more sophisticated explanations are clearly needed to account for the frequency drifts in bursts from lmxbs . indeed ,",
    "altogether different underlying mechanisms may be responsible for the burst oscillations in the two scenarios .",
    "suggested mechanisms include surface wave modes in the neutron star ocean and atmosphere @xcite , coriolis force containment @xcite , and magnetic confinement of the fuel @xcite .",
    "while the magnetic field in most lmxbs is likely too small ( @xmath5310@xmath54 g ) to confine the fuel , the magnetic field could be enhanced during bursts @xcite .",
    "several bursters have exhibited multi - peaked x - ray bursts without evidence of photospheric expansion , where both the bolometric luminosity and the temperature show multi - peaked profiles .",
    "these include double - peaked bursts from 4u 1608 - 52 @xcite , gx 17 + 2 @xcite and 4u 1709 - 267 @xcite , and about a dozen double - peaked and two unique triple - peaked bursts from the well - studied source 4u 1636 - 53 @xcite .",
    "examples of double - peaked light curves are shown in fig .",
    "the separation of the two peaks in the bolometric light curve is typically @xmath035 seconds , with the flux decreasing to values beween 20% and 50% of the maximum peak flux during this interval @xcite .",
    "time - resolved spectral analysis shows that the emitting area increases steadily from the start of the bursts until the beginning of the cooling tail @xcite . as well",
    ", a study of double- and triple - peaked bursts from 4u 1636 - 53 showed that all multi - peaked bursts occurred during periods of high accretion rate @xcite .",
    "bhattacharyya & strohmayer @xcite suggested that aspects of the observed double - peak features could be explained through the propagation of a burning front ignited either at the neutron star rotational pole or at high latitudes .",
    "the propagation towards the equator would be stalled at low latitudes as it would advance against the flow of matter transferred onto the equatorial plane from the accretion disk .",
    "this could explain the cooling after the first peak .",
    "after crossing the equator , the burning front would advance rapidly again towards the opposite pole , explaining the second peak ( but see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , ignition at the rotational pole would imply the absence of oscillations in the observed emission , as measured in some cases @xcite .",
    "ignition at high latitudes ( but not at the pole ) could explain the millisecond oscillations detected in the first peak for 4u 1636 - 53 , while the spread of the burning flame throughout the entire surface would explain the disappearance of the oscillations during the second peak @xcite .",
    "other explanations include two - step energy generation due to shear instabilities in the fuel @xcite or scattering of the x - ray emission by material evaporated from the disk @xcite , but these models do not reproduce the observed double - peaked burst temperature and radius profiles @xcite .",
    "a nuclear waiting point impedance in the thermonuclear reaction flow ( see section [ modresults ] ) was suggested by fisker et al.@xcite , but this has difficulties in explaining the large dips observed between the two peaks @xcite .",
    "the detection of absorption lines in the neutron star atmosphere is potentially the most direct and powerful tool for probing both the neutron star equation of state ( via determination of the gravitational redshift @xmath32 ) , and the products of nucleosynthesis during xrbs ( via the determination of abundances in the neutron star atmosphere , especially for pre bursts @xcite ) .",
    "the latter consideration is particularly relevant given that no material has been observed to be ejected during xrbs .",
    "the main observational difficulty with the detection of absorption features in xrbs is the short duration of the bursts : long exposure times are required to accumulate data with enough signal to noise . even for the most regular bursters such as gs 1826 - 24 , ks 1731 - 260 and i m 0836 - 425 , with bursts of 2040 s in duration occurring every 23 hours",

    "cottam et al.@xcite reported the first detection of gravitationally - redshifted absorption lines , in the x - ray spectrum of exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "these results were serendipitously obtained as exo 0748 - 676 had been chosen as a calibration source for the xmm - newton observatory . as a result , it was observed for 335 ks with the onboard reflection grating spectrometer ; such long periods for spectroscopic observations are not normally possible with x - ray observatories .",
    "a total of 28 type i bursts occurred during this time , with an effective exposure time to the x - ray burst spectrum of only 3200 s. this allowed the authors to identify several absorption features , including lines from fe xxv , fe xxvi and o viii that had been gravitationally redshifted by @xmath55 .",
    "however , these measurements were not confirmed during a second , longer observation of the same source with the same instrument @xcite .",
    "in addition , detailed calculations of the expected emission spectrum from the neutron star atmosphere of exo 0748 - 676 @xcite have cast serious doubts on the ability to identify absorption lines . a long observation of the regular bursting source gs 1826 - 24 also failed to detect any absorption features @xcite .",
    "exciting results have recently been reported using rxte that indicate the observation , albeit with limited spectral resolution , of absorption edges from fe - peak elements in photospheric radius  superexpansion \" bursts @xcite .",
    "such efforts are highly encouraging and future studies using instruments with higher spectral resolution ( such as xmm - newton or chandra@xcite ) should be a priority .",
    "within a year of the serendipitous discovery of xrbs @xcite more than 20 bursting sources were discovered .",
    "this included the enigmatic rapid burster @xcite , clearly at odds with the general behaviour exhibited by all the other bursting sources ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "any model attempting to characterize xrbs had to account simultaneously for the intermediate to long recurrence periods inferred from the majority of the sources as well as for the extremely short recurrence periods reported for the rapid burster .    a first series of models , in which bursts were driven by instabilities in the accretion flow onto a compact , stellar corpse ( a white dwarf , a neutron star , or a black hole ) was proposed by several groups .",
    "clearly , a compact object was required to host the explosion to guarantee that large amounts of gravitational energy were released as x - rays by matter falling into its deep gravitational well .",
    "the exact nature of the underlying compact object was a matter of debate , and in fact one of the early models assumed accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( @xmath56 @xmath57 @xcite ) .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved through observations of the bursting source 4u 1724 - 30 with the oso-8 satellite @xcite : the spectral evolution of one of its long bursts , best fitted with a blackbody spectrum with kt @xmath0 0.87  2.3 kev , suggested a much smaller source ( i.e. , either a neutron star or a stellar black hole ) . assuming a source distance of @xmath0 10 kpc , refs .",
    "@xcite inferred a blackbody radius for the source of @xmath0 10 km .",
    "other features such as spectral softening during the decay of type i xrbs , the harder x - ray spectra of bursting sources as compared with most of the x - ray transients hosting black hole candidates , as well as the masses inferred from those same systems , pointed towards neutron star primaries @xcite .",
    "these pioneering simulations considered effects such as instabilities in the interaction between the accreted matter and the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite , flare - like eruptions of magnetic energy generated and released through a toroidal field in the accretion disk @xcite , convective - driven instabilities in the disk @xcite , or thermal instabilities driven by compton heating of the accretion flow @xcite .    a second series of calculations relied on thermonuclear explosions in the layers accreted onto a neutron star @xcite .",
    "it was found that the characteristic timescale of a thermonuclear runaway on top of a neutron star was @xmath58 1 s@xcite , in rough agreement with the timescale of the x - ray emission reported from some bursting sources .",
    "it was clear , however , that the quick succession of flashes observed from the rapid burster could not be accounted for by this thermonuclear runaway model since not enough fuel could be piled up on the surface of the neutron star in such short time intervals .",
    "progress was made through the subsequent observation of two different types of bursts associated with the rapid burster , with different recurrence periods @xcite .",
    "the classification of type i and type ii bursts ( the former associated with thermonuclear flashes , the latter to accretion instabilities ) was then suggested .",
    "rosenbluth et al.@xcite were the first to quantify the nuclear energy released from the fusion of h - rich material on accreting neutron stars .",
    "it was later concluded @xcite that under certain conditions such nuclear fusion episodes may trigger thermonuclear runaways .",
    "the connection between unstable nuclear burning on the surfaces of neutron stars and type i xrbs , as envisaged by woosley and taam @xcite ( for he - driven bursts ) and maraschi and cavaliere @xcite ( for h - driven bursts ) paved the way for a suite of increasingly detailed numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "initial efforts to compare theoretical predictions and observations were made by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gross observational features of type i xrbs were qualitatively reproduced by early studies , already suggesting the possibility of constraining neutron star properties ( e.g. , masses , radii , equation of state ) through models . early dimensional analysis work @xcite revealed that for bursts driven by he - burning , one could expect recurrence periods of about 10 000 s , accreted envelope masses of the order of @xmath59 g , and an overall energy release of @xmath60 erg per burst .",
    "later predictions included peak luminosities of @xmath61 erg s@xmath1 ( with peak blackbody temperatures of @xmath62 k ) , light curve rise times of @xmath63 s , and light curve decay times of @xmath0 10 s , through consideration of the transport of nuclear energy from deep in the envelope to the outermost neutron star layers .",
    "another important observational constraint matched by thermonuclear models of type i xrbs was the @xmath13 parameter ( see section [ modresults ] ) , the ratio between time - integrated persistent and burst fluxes .",
    "the first detailed numerical models of xrbs can be found in joss  ( 1978 ) @xcite for several sets of mass - accretion rates and neutron star central temperatures .",
    "( the central temperature determines the initial surface luminosity assumed in a model . ) these parameters , together with the neutron star mass , equation of state and the metallicity of the accreted material , represent key ingredients in xrb modeling .",
    "joss s work quantitatively confirmed the values derived from dimensional analysis . as well",
    ", it stressed that a burst consumes virtually all the accreted fuel ( likely synthesizing fe - peak elements ) and that the energy released during the explosion is essentially emitted as x - rays from the neutron star photosphere .",
    "further numerical simulations @xcite revealed that for highly magnetized neutron stars ( @xmath64 g ) , matter transferred from the stellar companion would be funneled onto the neutron star magnetic poles , enhancing the local accretion rates in those regions by a factor of @xmath65 .",

    "these are important for the interpretation of observational properties of x - ray bursts .",

    ", one must carefully distinguish between the different numerical approaches used in the calculations .",
    "one category of models includes parameterized one - zone calculations @xcite .",
    "these simple prescriptions relate the history of the neutron star s accreted envelope with the time evolution of the temperature @xmath67 and density @xmath68 in a single layer of the envelope .",
    "such thermodynamic quantities are often determined through semi - analytical models , or occasionally correspond to t-@xmath68 profiles directly extracted from 1-d hydrodynamic models .",
    "this approach , while representing an extreme oversimplification of the physical conditions governing neutron star envelopes , was used extensively to overcome the time limitations that arose in computationally intensive hydrodynamic calculations . for similar reasons ,",

    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the underlying assumption in all these models is spherical symmetry .",
    "this simplifying hypothesis demands that the explosion occur uniformly over a spherical shell .",

    "the manner by which each waiting point nuclide is eventually depleted depends on the nuclear structure in the immediate mass region of this species : some are destroyed by @xmath16-decay , some by ( @xmath13,p ) reactions , and others by sequential ( rather than direct ) two - proton capture ( see section [ nucover ] ) .",
    "the bursts in both models are eventually quenched by the exhaustion of h and he fuel rather than through any significant envelope expansion ( see fig .",
    "[ profiles ] , lower panel ) .",
    "we note that a typical range of metallicity for the accreted material is difficult to determine .",
    "whereas solar metallicities may be regarded as representative ( e.g. , a thorough comparison between observations of the x - ray burster gs 1826 - 24 and models with different metallicities favoured the accretion of material of solar metallicity@xcite ) , the identification of many bursting sources in globular clusters implies that lower metallicities should also be expected .",

    "in addition , explosions in metal - deficient envelopes are characterized by lower peak luminosities and larger light curve decline times .",
    "similar trends are reported by the santa cruz group @xcite when comparing models accreting solar and low metallicity material .",

    "@xcite concerns the larger effect played by the metallicity of the accreted material in the models computed by the barcelona group @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xcite explained the moderate effect they found as due to  compositional inertia \" washing out the influence of the initial metallicity .",
    "this effect refers to how properties of bursts may be sensitive to the fact that accretion occurs onto the ashes of previous bursts , minimizing the impact of the actual metallicity of the accreted material after sufficient bursts have been calculated .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by ref .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies ( as well as other discrepancies in peak luminosities , recurrence rates or @xmath13 values for a common metallicity ) is not yet clear .",
    "although xrb properties depend only weakly upon the neutron star mass ( or surface gravity ) , some of the differences outlined between the three studies may be attributed to the combined effects of different assumptions for the adopted neutron star size and to differences in the input physics ( e.g. , nuclear reaction network , opacities , treatment of convective transport ) .    aside from any metallicity - dependent effects ,",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ ltonuc ] that different nucleosynthesis patterns are associated with different characteristic burst light curves .",
    "this is seen even within sequences of bursts calculated at a given metallicity ( see , e.g. , figs . 19 and 20 in ref .",
    "@xcite , or figs . 13 and 15 in ref .",
    "this relationship is of vital importance since the products of nucleosynthesis during an xrb have not been directly observed in a straightforward , reliable manner ( see section [ absorption ] ) . as such , from the point of view of nuclear astrophysics , experimental nuclear physicists can not rely solely on exploring the effect of a nuclear laboratory measurement on xrb nucleosynthesis ; one must also examine the effect of the measurement on the principal observable of an xrb , namely , the burst light curve .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the cases of classical nova explosions or supernovae , in which the products of nucleosynthesis are ejected into space and can be observed through spectroscopy or other means .",
    "fortunately , the link between nucleosynthesis in xrbs and the predicted light curves provides an essential guide to help judge which nuclear physics uncertainties may most significantly affect xrb light curves ( see section [ sens ] ) .",
    "the effect of the adopted mass - accretion rate on burst properties has recently been investigated by ref .",
    "models of 1.4 m@xmath6 neutron stars ( @xmath78 l@xmath6 ) accreting matter at @xmath115 m@xmath6 yr@xmath1 ( 0.02 @xmath77 ) and at @xmath116 m@xmath6 yr@xmath1 ( as mentioned above ) were computed for two different metallicities ( solar and 5% solar ) .",
    "for the models accreting material of solar metallicity , those with @xmath117 m@xmath6 exhibited combined h / he flashes , while bursts from models with @xmath118 m@xmath6 yr@xmath1 experienced ignition in a pure , h - free , he layer , yielding briefer , brighter light curves with shorter tails , very rapid rise times ( @xmath119 s ) , and ashes corresponding to elements below the fe region .",
    "this is in agreement with the discussion in section [ obsover ] .    with regard to bursts featuring bolometric luminosities with double - peaked profiles , fisker et al.@xcite report that some of the observed features ( see section [ multipeak ] ) could be explained , in part , through a waiting point impedance in the nucleosynthesis accompanying an xrb . for suitable accretion rates ,",
    "the first peak could be caused by the rapid ignition of he accumulated at the base of the envelope , following the burning of h through the cno cycle .",
    "energy released from this he burning region would stimulate thermonuclear ignition in other shells where h may not have been fully converted to he .",
    "the abundance flows in these higher - lying shells may then determine whether or not a second peak is produced .",
    "for example , if the flow encounters a waiting point nucleus , the nuclear energy generation rate may decrease , possibly causing the surface luminosity to also decrease .",
    "once the flow proceeds again , beyond the waiting point , the surface luminosity may increase again .",
    "fisker et al .",
    "suggest that waiting points at @xmath120 mg , @xmath121si , @xmath109s , and @xmath122ar may be of consequence in this context , and that reaction rates to better determine how these nuclei are eventually destroyed ( e.g. , through ( @xmath13,p ) reactions ) should therefore be measured .",
    "finally , a long - debated aspect of the nucleosynthesis accompanying xrbs is the potential role of these phenomena as nuclear factories of the elusive light p - nuclei @xmath123mo and @xmath124ru @xcite ( for a review on the production of p - nuclei , see arnould and goriely@xcite ) .",
    "matter accreted onto a neutron star of mass @xmath30 @xmath0 1.4 m@xmath6 and radius @xmath26 @xmath0 10 km releases @xmath125 mev per nucleon , whereas only a few mev per nucleon are released from thermonuclear fusion .",
    "ejection from a neutron star is therefore energetically unlikely , as confirmed by all recent hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "even though radiation - driven winds during photospheric radius expansion ( see section [ pre ] ) may lead to the ejection of a tiny fraction ( i.e. , @xmath01% ) of the envelope @xcite , it has not yet been rigorously analyzed whether such winds may contain material synthesized during the burst .",
    "furthermore , in one - zone nucleosynthesis calculations the chemical species are assumed to represent the whole ( by construction , chemically homogeneous ) envelope . in multi - zone hydrodynamic simulations , however , the abundances of many species , including these p - nuclei , decrease dramatically towards the outer envelope layers because of limited convective transport .",
    "unfortunately it is these layers that are most likely to be ejected by radiation - driven winds .",
    "the predicted overproduction factors in these outer regions @xcite are several orders of magnitude smaller than those required to account for the origin of galactic light p - nuclei @xcite , in sharp contrast with the results reported from one - zone calculations @xcite .",
    "we conclude that xrbs are unlikely to be dominant contributors to the galactic abundances of p - nuclei , according to current models .",
    "we have already discussed in section [ modresults ] some general features of type i x - ray burst nucleosynthesis .",
    "the interplay of charged - particle reactions and @xmath16-decays at temperatures and densities characteristic of xrbs crucially defines the overall abundance flow and nucleosynthesis . instead of a smoothly continuous abundance flow from lighter to heavier nuclear species we should envision a flow in very fast spurts ( @xmath51 s ) , each delayed significantly at the  waiting point nuclei \" where the capture of successive charged - particles is inhibited by strong reverse photodisintegration reactions . from these general considerations",
    "we can deduce the nuclear quantities generally needed for studying the nucleosynthesis in type i xrbs .",
    "the basic quantity required is the thermonuclear reaction rate per particle pair , @xmath126 , defined as the number of nuclear reactions taking place in the stellar plasma per unit volume and per unit time .",
    "specifically , the reaction rate represents the integral over all kinetic energies @xmath127 , of the product of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution and the nuclear reaction cross section @xmath28 .",
    "it is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the reduced mass , @xmath130 is avogadro s number , @xmath131 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath67 is the stellar temperature .",
    "there are a number of strategies for estimating the thermonuclear reaction rate , depending on the nuclear reaction mechanism .",
    "when the cross section varies smoothly with energy and is devoid of any structure , the reaction most likely proceeds via a very fast ( i.e. , less than 10@xmath132 seconds ) , single step mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "if the incoming projectile is absorbed by the target nucleus , sharing all its energy with the target nucleons over a much longer period of time ( i.e. , about 10@xmath133 seconds ) , the cross section most likely will exhibit a sharp peak , called a resonance .",
    "in reality many resonances with different energies and strengths ( i.e. , the integrated resonance cross section ) will contribute to the reaction rate .",
    "in the most favourable case , the total reaction rate can be derived from experimental nuclear data .",
    "significant advances have been made recently for evaluating such  experimental \" reaction rates using a monte carlo procedure in order to estimate statistically rigorous values @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when no nuclear data are available , the reaction rate must be estimated with the aid of nuclear reaction models , for example , the statistical ( hauser - feshbach ) model ( see below ) , or the nuclear shell model ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in either case , reaction rates derived under the assumption that all target nuclei are in their ground states (  laboratory rates \" ) must , in general , be corrected for thermal excitations of the target nuclei in order to estimate  stellar rates \" . the required correction , or",
    " stellar enhancement factor \" ( sef ) , can also be derived from the hauser - feshbach model ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for the specific case of type i x - ray bursts , the peak temperatures achieved ( @xmath134 gk ) result in",
    "small predicted correction factors for most nuclear reactions .",
    "it is often not appreciated that under certain special conditions the thermonuclear rate of a given reaction is irrelevant , despite the fact that the main abundance flow passes through this nuclear link .",
    "this situation may arise , for example , at sufficiently high temperatures when the abundance flow encounters a waiting point with a very small ( less than a few hundred kev ) , or even negative , proton separation energy ( i.e. , the minimum energy required to initiate proton emission ) . in this case ,",
    "an equilibrium between the rates of the forward reaction and corresponding reverse photodisintegration is quickly established .",
    "clearly , once equilibrium has been established for a given pair of nuclei @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the abundance flow and nucleosynthesis near the waiting point become independent of the reaction rates linking these two species . to be more specific ,",
    "consider nuclides @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 located near the proton dripline , where an equilibrium @xmath138 is established .",
    "furthermore , assume that species @xmath136 may only be depleted via another reaction , @xmath139 .",
    "the nucleosynthesis depends then on the relative magnitude of the decay constants for the competing @xmath16-decay and the sequential two - proton capture of the waiting point nucleus @xmath135 .",
    "the latter decay constant is given by @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the proton number density , @xmath142 is planck s constant , @xmath143 is the reduced mass of @xmath144 , the @xmath145 are the nuclear spins , and the @xmath146 are the normalized partition functions ( i.e. , a factor expressing the thermal distribution of nuclear levels in a given nuclide ) .",
    "the last two factors in eq .",
    "( 3 ) contain the most important quantities : the decay constant for sequential two - proton capture depends on the q - value ( i.e. , the nuclear energy released ) , but not the reaction rate , of the @xmath147 reaction and , in addition , on the reaction rate of the _ subsequent _ @xmath148 reaction . because the q - value enters exponentially in the above expression it must be known with good precision , say , better than a few tens of kev @xcite . particularly important are the q - values for the ( p,@xmath74 ) reactions on the waiting point nuclei @xmath96ge , @xmath107se and @xmath111kr @xcite .",
    "many of the q - values , or equivalently , the nuclear masses of the respective nuclides , for reactions taking place in type i x - ray burst nucleosynthesis have been measured experimentally , although a number of nuclear masses need to be estimated by extrapolating experimental values @xcite . for several crucial links , the reaction q - values",

    "only a tiny fraction of the thermonuclear reaction rates are derived from directly measured nuclear physics input .",
    "the few direct measurements that have been performed , necessarily involving radioactive ion beams , focused mainly on the breakout sequences from the cno mass range ( section [ expeff ] ) .",

    "another major advantage of the hauser - feshbach model is that the effects of thermal target excitations on the reaction rate can be included in a straightforward manner .",
    "an extensive discussion of the hauser - feshbach model in nuclear astrophysics applications can be found in goriely et al.@xcite and rauscher @xcite .    how well do current hauser - feshbach rates for charged - particle reactions reproduce the rates based on experiment ?",
    "a preliminary answer is given in fig .",

    "for all ratios shown , the  minimum temperature for applicability of the hauser - feshbach model \" ( @xmath158 , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is smaller than @xmath157 .",
    "a few interesting observations can be made :    * for ( p,@xmath74 ) reactions on target nuclei in the @xmath159 range , there is considerable scatter in the ratios of hauser - feshbach and experimental reaction rates ( note the dashed horizontal lines , indicating a factor of 2 deviation ) , up to factors of 100 in a few cases . *",
    "the theoretical ( p,@xmath74 ) rates from non - smoker and talys also differ considerably in several instances , up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this is not surprising , considering that these codes employ different global models for the nuclear physics input ( i.e. , transmission coefficients and level densities ) .",
    "* for the five ( p,@xmath13 ) or ( @xmath156 ) reactions shown in blue online , the agreement between hauser - feshbach and experimental results , as well as between non - smoker and talys rates , is much better than for ( p,@xmath74 ) reactions .",
    "this is especially surprising because relatively fewer levels will contribute to the rates of ( p,@xmath13 ) and ( @xmath13,@xmath74 ) reactions compared to proton capture because of angular momentum selection rules ( at the same excitation energy in the compound nucleus above the projectile separation energy ) .",
    "* for projectile separation energies below 3 mev , about half of the rate ratios exceed the  factor of 2 \" deviation band ; i.e. , there is a large risk that adopting hauser - feshbach results will overestimate the actual rate significantly .",
    "this is not surprising because the level densities at these excitation energies are relatively small and the conditions for the applicability of statistical reaction models are rarely fulfilled .",

    "there is generally better agreement , as expected from level density arguments .",
    "there is some scatter , but _ on average _ the hauser - feshbach calculations seem to reproduce the experimental rates within a factor of two .",

    "second , nothing can be concluded regarding other types of reactions , such as ( @xmath13,p ) , or for target masses in excess of @xmath160 .",
    "third , for obvious reasons , the ratios presented here apply to stable target nuclei only .",
    "however , one may suspect that the deviations between hauser - feshbach and experimental rates will be larger for unstable target nuclei .",
    "clearly , more work is needed to quantify the effects discussed above .",
    "we have mentioned the large number of nuclides and interactions needed to accurately determine the nucleosynthesis in type i x - ray bursts , whether within the framework of multi - zone hydrodynamic simulations or simpler one - zone models .",
    "sufficient experimental information to calculate an experimentally - based thermonuclear rate over xrb temperatures only exists for a limited number of reactions .",
    "therefore , most reaction rates in an xrb model depend upon theoretical calculations , as discussed in section [ sechf ] . to reduce the reliance on these theoretical rates , experimentalists should measure nuclear physics quantities ( e.g. , resonance energies , resonance strengths ) needed to extend existing experimentally - based rates to the relevant temperatures for xrbs . furthermore",
    ", reaction rate equilibria can be better quantified and the input to theoretical rate calculations can be improved through measurements of , e.g. , nuclear masses .",
    "since nucleosynthesis in xrbs eventually extends far into the proton - rich side beyond the valley of stability ( section [ modpred ] ) , it is clear that radioactive beams are needed to perform many of the desired measurements . to maximize the impact of these measurements",
    ", experiments should focus upon the reduction of those uncertainties in reaction rates and nuclear masses that most significantly influence model predictions of xrb observables .",
    "a useful technique to identify important nuclear interactions involves the examination of the impact on model predictions from the systematic variation of each interaction in a network by its uncertainty .",
    "each rate may be varied independently ( requiring , in theory , as many model calculations as there are rates in the associated network ) or simultaneously through a monte carlo method ( from which e.g. , correlations between an enhancement factor applied to a rate x and the corresponding change in the yield of an isotope y may be deduced ) . for theoretical rates in the network",
    ", suitable variation factors may be adopted to account for possible discrepancies , as discussed in section [ sechf ] .",

    "fisker et al.@xcite multiplied the rates of the @xmath109s(@xmath13,p ) and @xmath122ar(@xmath13,p ) reactions by factors of 100 , finding minor effects from each variation relevant to a double - peak structure in their light curves ( see section [ modresults ] ) .",
    "finally , fisker et al.@xcite and davids et al.@xcite , using different codes , varied the @xmath165o(@xmath13,@xmath74 ) rate within uncertainties to ascertain its impact on light curves .",
    "curiously , contradictory results indicative of model dependencies are seen .",
    "when fisker et al .",
    "@xcite used what they refer to as a  lower limit \" for the @xmath165o(@xmath13,@xmath74 ) rate , their model revealed non - bursting behaviour  more precisely , a slowly oscillating luminosity with a period of about four hours .",
    "the use of a larger rate produced bursts in their model , with @xmath93 about two orders of magnitude greater than luminosities they found with the lower rate .",
    "on the other hand , when davids et al.@xcite used a very similar rate to fisker et al.s  lower limit \" ( within a model with similar accretion rate as well ) their simulation not only produced bursts , but the _ brightest _ bursts ; namely , a _ larger _",

    "the energy generation maxima occur roughly where the waiting - point abundances change rapidly  see e.g. , ref .",

    "this is especially true if variations in a particular reaction rate or q - value affect predicted quantities in multiple one - zone models ( where each uses a different thermodynamic history ) .",

    "<S> type i x - ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions that occur in the envelopes of accreting neutron stars </S>",
    "<S> . detailed observations of these phenomena have prompted numerous studies in theoretical astrophysics and experimental nuclear physics since their discovery over 35 years ago . in this review , we begin by discussing key observational features of these phenomena that may be sensitive to the particular patterns of nucleosynthesis from the associated thermonuclear burning . </S>",
    "<S> we then summarize efforts to model type i x - ray bursts , with emphasis on determining the nuclear physics processes involved throughout these bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss and evaluate limitations in the models , particularly with regard to key uncertainties in the nuclear physics input . finally , we examine recent , relevant experimental measurements and outline future prospects to improve our understanding of these unique environments from observational , theoretical and experimental perspectives </S>",
