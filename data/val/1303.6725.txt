    "the effect of gravitational lensing is to redistribute the intensity from sources behind the lens into images with different positions and brightnesses , while conserving surface brightness @xcite .",
    "this means that gravitational lensing not only magnifies the background sources , but also changes their apparent density on the sky .",
    "the details of whether the number counts of background sources seen through a foreground gravitational lens are increased or decreased depend on the properties of the lens and the slope of the faint counts @xcite , a process known as magnification bias @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we report detection of a deficit in the surface brightness of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) in the centers of massive galaxy clusters measured using the spire instrument @xcite on the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite . to interpret these observations and understand the consequences of lensing a background field , the lensing properties of the cluster and the background source population are carefully simulated in a large number of realizations .",
    "we concentrate on the intensity profile after removing detected sources to highlight faint fluctuations in the cib .",
    "the resulting effect after such a removal is a localized region of decreased surface brightness at the cluster center .",
    "we use these observations to constrain the intensity of the submillimeter ( sub - mm ) background at @xmath2 m .",
    "this study uses confusion - limited maps of galaxy clusters from the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spire data are reduced using a combination of the hipe @xcite and smap ( @xcite ; @xcite ) packages .",
    "the sample of clusters is listed in @xcite and m.  zemcov et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    in order to study the strongly lensed regions it is necessary to restrict our attention to those clusters large enough that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the solid angle of the negative magnification region and @xmath5 is the solid angle of the spire beam .",
    "this cut leaves only four clusters from the hermes sample of twelve : a370 , a1689 , a2219  and rx j@xmath6 .",
    "the negative magnification region in the image plane maps to the interior of the lens caustic in the source plane , so it is a reasonable tracer of the area which undergoes strong lensing .",
    "the mapping from total mass to lensing characteristics is complex and the area @xmath4 is not strictly proportional to cluster mass ; however , this cut does effectively restrict our analysis to the most massive centrally condensed systems .    to measure the deficit ,",
    "a catalog is generated for each cluster at each spire wavelength using the scat algorithm @xcite based on @xmath2 m source - selection .",
    "our goal is not to identify particular point sources , but rather to remove emission from bright point sources , so employing a low detection threshold is reasonable .",
    "we chose a @xmath7 threshold , where @xmath8 is the map root - mean - square variation , dominated in these maps by confusion noise .",
    "the measurement is not sensitive to the precise value of this number provided it is not so high as to leave residual sources ( @xmath9 ) nor so low as to needlessly mask a large fraction of the map ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this yields a catalog of @xmath11 sources in each cluster field which are then subtracted from the cluster image using a gaussian model of the beam .",
    "an example of the resulting image for one cluster is shown in figure [ fig : maps ] , which shows a statistical deficit in surface brightness near the center of the cluster .",
    "a simple way to visualize this deficit is to plot annular averages of the source - subtracted maps , as shown in figure [ fig : clustercenter ] .",
    "similar averages centered on randomly chosen positions in spire images do not show this deficit .",
    "gravitational lensing conserves surface brightness and therefore does not alter the mean intensity of the extragalactic background light at any wavelength . however , this statement applies only when all sources are kept in calculating the intensity profile and when averaged over many directions through the cluster  for some configurations of the background sky unusually bright images can be found .",
    "the measurement reported here involves the removal of bright detected sources , which leads to a situation where lensing shows a profile that does not conserve intensity .",
    "this does not imply that the total number of photons and therefore intensity is not conserved , as discussed in @xcite , since detected sources are removed .    when viewed through a lensing cluster imposing a magnification @xmath12 on background sources , a background source with flux density @xmath13",
    "is magnified such that the observed flux density is @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting increase in the flux density is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the projected surface density of galaxies ; the observed number density of sources through the lens is modified to be @xmath15 .",
    "the overall effect of this is to modulate existing fluctuations in the background source field . using the parameterization that the intrinsic number count of the faint background sources scales as @xmath16 , the differential number counts lensed through the cluster become @xmath17 .",
    "the differential counts imaged through the cluster are either decreased or increased depending on whether the intrinsic counts have a slope @xmath18 smaller than or greater than 2 . if sources are not removed from the image , the total cib surface brightness is conserved @xcite .    the observations reported here",
    "do not constrain the exact number counts of sources or the difference of the counts of sources through and away from the cluster .",
    "one reason for this is that the observations are limited by the angular resolution of the spire instrument , which results in a blending of the faintest sources .",
    "the effects of limited - resolution observations of the intensity profile of background sources through the cluster are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "high resolution observations with alma will allow more precise measurements of the difference in the counts away from and through the cluster .",
    "we can use detailed lensing models of these well - studied clusters and models of the source counts and redshift distributions of the sources which comprise the cib to generate numerical simulations of the observed sky brightness , and explore how the amplitude of an observed deficit depends on source model parameters . to simulate the sub - mm background",
    ", we use the model described in @xcite , which is tuned to match a variety of observed number counts @xmath19 and is forced to integrate to the total intensity of the cib @xcite .",
    "the model associates both a spectral shape and redshift to each source , down to @xmath20 .",
    "these simulations do not include coherent clustering of the galaxies which comprise the sub - mm background , which is a small effect on the scales of interest here ( @xmath21 arcmin ; @xcite ) .",
    "poisson noise is modeled by the simulation and accounts for the cosmic variance one would expect in the real sky .",
    "the simulated images have area @xmath22 deg@xmath23 and contain @xmath24 sources to source fluxes @xmath25njy .",
    "these simulated backgrounds are then lensed using lenstool models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are built using optical measurements of strong lensing in the cluster fields ( a370   @xcite ; a1689   @xcite ; a2219   @xcite @xcite ; rx j@xmath6  ",
    "@xcite ) , modeling all of the known high - magnification images measured for each cluster .",
    "the lenstool models replicate all of the phenomenology arising from the complex dark - matter potentials of each cluster , including multiple images , giant arcs , etc .",
    "gravitational lensing is achromatic , so the same lens model applies at all wavelengths .",
    "sources with @xmath26 are included in the simulated sky map , but are not lensed ; all the sources with @xmath27 are lensed from redshift planes discretized into @xmath28 steps .",
    "varying the redshift distribution of the @xcite model within reasonable limits does not change the results of these simulations .",
    "an example of one such simulation is shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "the central surface brightness deficit is evident in the modeled image in all three spire bands .",
    "these simulations show that three factors contribute to the effect reported here : ( 1 ) the sizes and typical lensing amplification factors of clusters , ( 2 ) the number densities and redshifts of the sources responsible for the cib , and ( 3 ) the sensitivity and beam size of spire .",
    "these combine so that when we examine the lensed cores of spire images of cluster fields and remove all reasonably significant sources , we are left with deficits in the surface brightness of the sky in small regions near the cluster center .    in order to compare the data to the simulations , we use the same procedure discussed above on simulations of the cluster targets . in these simulations ,",
    "instrumental noise with the same amplitude as the data is inserted into the simulated , lensed cluster images which are propagated through an identical detection / subtraction procedure as the real data , resulting in the gray bands in figure [ fig : clustercenter ] which represent the mean and standard deviation of the model results drawn from 100 realizations of the background sky .",
    "these capture the variance of the lensing deficit due to different background configurations and reflect the range of possible deficit shapes and amplitudes arising from our ignorance of the exact configuration of the background sources .",
    "a potential concern is whether simulating sources to @xmath29njy is sufficient for the modeling result to converge . to check this",
    ", we have performed simulations where sources are excluded below @xmath30 . by @xmath31jy",
    "the map is densely populated and the effect has converged , and including fainter sources does not have an appreciable effect on the amplitude of the deficit . this is because sources below @xmath32jy are rarely boosted above the @xmath7 detection threshold so do not create a net deficit after source removal .    to investigate the dependence of the deficit on the background number counts ,",
    "we perform simulations drawn from the measured counts presented in @xcite , similar to the calculations in @xcite .",
    "the slope of the faint end for @xmath33mjy @xmath34mjy is varied in @xmath35 , bracketing the nominal value @xmath36 which accounts for the firas background ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as can be seen in figure [ fig : simgamma ] , for shallow slopes ,",
    "the surface density of sources is small enough to produce zero flux in the center of clusters . for steeper slopes ,",
    "the probability that a source falls behind the center of the cluster image is no longer small and the surface brightness increases .",
    "existing constraints on the brightness of the cib at @xmath2 m exclude @xmath37 at @xmath38 in this range @xcite .",
    "according to our simulations using the @xcite model , statistically the central region of these clusters images have zero surface brightness from lensed sources . at @xmath2 m ,",
    "emission from sources within the central arcminute of clusters tends to be faint .",
    "therefore a situation arises where the cluster itself is `` invisible '' , the probability of a foreground source coinciding with the cluster center is small , and the background is lensed by the cluster , so no sources of emission exist in the center of the cluster .",
    "if this region has zero surface brightness , as the model suggests , we can use it as an absolute zero point .",

    "though only a @xmath58 fractional contamination in the @xmath2 m spire band , the sz effect is significant at longer sub - mm wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) so we defer reporting the cib inferred from the two longer wavelength spire bands to future work .",
    "sub - mm emission associated with the central region of target clusters is known @xcite ; for example , in the hermes sample ( but excluded from this work ) abell 1835  and abell 2390  are both known to host bcgs with sub - mm fluxes of many mjy . because of this potential bias , the lensing deficit yields a lower limit to the cib . to check for contamination from galaxies within the critical region , we use _",

    "we do not detect other @xmath59 m sources associated with the cluster in the central deficit region .",
    "diffuse dust emission associated with the intracluster medium has never been detected , but from predictions we expect this kind of emission to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the surface brightness of the lensing deficit at @xmath61 m @xcite .    to determine the absolute intensity of the cib , the average of each map in its central region is used to generate a zero point for the image .",
    "the mean brightness of the resulting image , excluding the central region , is then computed . to estimate the uncertainty associated with each measurement ,",

    "we estimate the eddington bias associated with the effect of subtracting sources from the maps before computing the mean of the central region by comparing simulations including and excluding simulated noise , resulting in an estimate of @xmath65mjy sr@xmath1 for the eddington bias on the sample .",
    "table [ tab : cib ] lists the areas of negative magnification in each target , the inferred cib brightness for each of the four cluster fields that pass all of the selection cuts , and the uncertainty budget associated with these measurements .",
    "the statistical - uncertainty weighted mean of this value , @xmath66mjy sr@xmath1 , is the inferred brightness of the cib at @xmath2 m from the lensing deficit method .",
    "this value is consistent with the firas values determined by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the same band within @xmath7 .",
    "we have detected an interesting new phenomenon which is due to the properties of the sub - mm background and gravitational lensing in massive clusters .",
    "this deficit in the measured surface brightness constrains the smallest allowable surface brightness of the cib and so is another way to limit its absolute brightness , adding to a list which includes @xmath67 analyses , stacking , and source counting , in addition to direct photometric measurement .",
    "furthermore , in principle the presence of this deficit places interesting constraints on the faint end of the number counts , although larger samples and comprehensive modeling are required to convert measurements to source count constraints .",
    "because gravitational lensing is achromatic , this effect occurs in all of the spire bands .",
    "other instruments working at sub - mm and mm wavelengths like act / spt and ccat should also be able to measure this deficit effect , assuming that the background in question is sufficiently far behind the lensing cluster , and that the instrumentation is sensitive to sources at levels similar to spire s with enough angular resolution to resolve the central region of clusters .",
    "in addition , this effect produces a complicated , spatially structured cib surface brightness distribution which is a potential foreground for high resolution sz effect measurements at longer wavelengths .",
