    "a recent development in radiotherapy treatment planning is to use an optimization process to obtain a treatment plan .",
    "to do so one needs to formalize the clinical objectives in a so called object function whose optimum should correspond to an optimal treatment plan .",
    "many current treatment planning systems rely on a quasi - newton algorithm to perform the optimization . in order to guarantee that this process indeed converges to an optimum the object function",
    "should at least be twice continuously differentiable .",
    "this last property is the main subject of this study .",
    "as it turns out the object functions used in radiotherapy do not always have this property so that convergence of the optimization process can not directly be guaranteed in those cases .",
    "in section [ sec : optbg ] we present some background for the use of optimization in radiotherapy treatment planning .",
    "the object functions currently used are built from so called dose - volume and eud constraints . by dose - volume constraints ,",
    "the dose - volume histogram enters the object function .",
    "it is the finite differentiability of the former that causes the insufficient differentiability of the latter . in section",
    "[ sec : objdiff ] this relationship is explained in more detail .",
    "a example illustrates how finite differentiability of the object function influences the optimization process .",
    "the practical consequences thereof are the subject of section [ sec : conc ] . where section [ sec : objdiff ] is kept informal , section [ sec : proof ] provides formal statements and proofs of the differentiability results .",
    "this last section does not contain new arguments but serves as a support for the exposition .",
    "in radiotherapy treatment planning a careful choice of values for treatment parameters is necessary to obtain a dose distribution in the patient that meets criteria for eradicating a malignant tumour . at the same time",
    "it should meet criteria so that healthy tissues and organs are not critically damaged . due to the fact that dose is deposited in every irradiated part of the patient , these criteria are conflicting in almost every clinical situation .",
    "experienced planners are usually very good at intuitively balancing such conflicting goals , still there is a need for more objective and quantifiable methods to devise and evaluate treatment plans .",
    "this has led to the construction of object functions , depending on treatment parameters , which formalize the objectives of dose on tumours and healthy tissues , see @xcite . by optimizing this object function with respect to treatment parameters , one hopes to get an optimal treatment plan .",
    "another , very different , reason to use optimization in treatment planning is the emergence of imrt where the sheer number of treatment parameters simply precludes manual planning .",
    "even if we know that a function has a unique optimum , there is no simple recipe to find it .",
    "therefore we have to resort to numerical , iterative methods to solve optimization problems , which , given a starting point , generate a sequence converging to an optimum .",
    "the latter can be guaranteed only if certain conditions on the object function are met .",
    "it seems , however , that if these conditions are considered at all , it is taken for granted that they are fulfilled .",
    "many treatment planning systems use a quasi - newton method , like the lbfgs algorithm , to find an optimum of the object function , see for example @xcite or @xcite as a general reference .",
    "one of the conditions guaranteeing that this algorithm yields a sequence locally converging to an optimum is that the object function is twice continuously differentiable .",
    "the object functions currently used in treatment planning systems are limited to so called _ eud constraints _ and _ dose - volume constraints _ , or combinations of both , see for example @xcite , but also see section [ sec : objrt ] remark [ rem : compro ] .",
    "our results show that the former do satisfy the differentiability condition .",
    "the latter however , do not , that is not for all values of the treatment parameters .      the goal of radiotherapy treatment planning is to devise a treatment plan achieving a high _ tumour control probability _",
    "( tcp ) combined with a low _ normal tissue complication probability _ ( ntcp ) . a priori",
    "both tcp and ntcp are unrelated to treatment parameters . even relating them to criteria on the dose distribution in the patient",
    "is a non - trivial task . to simplify matters",
    "one does not consider the 3-dimensional dose distribution , but a derived quantity namely the dose - volume histogram for each relevant region .",
    "the latter are tumours and healthy organs for which the dose - volume histogram tells which part of the volume receives at least a certain dose , see equation ( [ eq : volfun ] ) below .",
    "data from previously treated patients are used to relate tcp and ntcp to dose - volume histograms , see @xcite . at this point",
    "further simplifications are necessary , because tcp and ntcp can only be related to certain points of dose - volume histograms or even only to averages . generally for tumours",
    "this leads to dose - volume constraints , that is a minimum and a maximum dose for volumes @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , or in a more concise notation @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in case of healthy tissues the situation is much more complicated , in practice one uses a mixture of dose - volume constraints and eud constraints , see @xcite .",
    "criteria for the dose distribution or the derived dose - volume histograms are related to treatment parameters , thus the treatment planning objectives can be expressed with an object function of these treatment parameters .",
    "now the object function used in treatment planning is a weighted sum of local object functions , one for each dose - volume constraint or eud constraint .",
    "let us consider a tumour with a minimum and a maximum dose - volume constraint .",
    "furthermore @xmath4 is the dose - volume histogram of the tumour for a given dose distribution and treatment parameters @xmath5 , that is @xmath6 is the ( relative ) volume of the tumour , region @xmath7 , receiving at least dose @xmath8 @xmath9 in this expression @xmath10 is the volume of the region @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the dose distribution .",
    "one constructs what we will call _ local object functions_. for example the local object function for a minimum does - volume constraint for a specific volume is a function @xmath13 which increases the more the actual relative volume at @xmath14 is below @xmath0 and decreases or even becomes zero if the actual relative volume at @xmath14 is above @xmath0 .",
    "similarly a maximum dose object function @xmath15 is constructed such that it increases when the relative volume at @xmath16 is above @xmath1 and decreases or becomes zero otherwise .",
    "thus the object function for the tumour alone would be the weighted sum of two local object functions , usually of the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are weights and @xmath20 although the object function @xmath21 is a function of the treatment parameters @xmath5 it does not depend on them directly , but only via the dose - volume histograms .",
    "the latter depend on the dose distribution which directly depends on the treatment parameters .",
    "the eud constraints are in a similar way expressed in the _ equivalent uniform dose_. a quantity used to measure the biological effect of radiation especially for healthy tissues , see @xcite .",
    "we denote the equivalent uniform dose by @xmath22 , here it is a function of treatment parameters @xmath5 @xmath23^{1/\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    * remarks *    1 .   [ rem : compro ] the word _ constraint _ in this context is somewhat misleading because a dose - volume nor an eud constraint is used as a constraint in the sense of constrained optimization .",
    "if they were , many if not most optimization problems in treatment planning would have no solution .",
    "it is a common clinical situation that a tumour is located adjacent to a critical organ . for several reasons the region , called ptv , on which the treatment dose is prescribed is larger than the tumour .",
    "see @xcite for a systematic description of xtv s , where x = g , c , i or p. therefore the critical organ is possibly partly located in the ptv .",
    "suppose for example that one third of the volume of the critical organ is located inside the ptv .",
    "furthermore suppose that the minimal dose - volume constraint on the ptv is 60 gy ( gy is unit of dose ) and the maximum average dose constraint on the organ is 20 gy . since the dose distribution varies continuously in space and its gradient is bounded , this constrained optimization problem will have no solution .",
    "due to the anatomy a minimum dose of 60 gy on the ptv implies an average dose well above 20 gy on the organ and vice versa .",
    "a weighted sum of local object functions is a way to find a clinically acceptable compromise for this situation . to avoid the term _ constraint",
    "_ some authors use the term _ soft constraint _ , but in my opinion this term is superfluous because we already have the notion of object function .",
    "nevertheless we adhere to the word constraint , in order to stay in line with the existing literature .",
    "[ rem : eud ] the equivalent uniform dose , as defined in equation ( [ eq : eud ] ) , can be regarded as a generalized average , in fact for @xmath24 it is the standard average of the dose distribution over the region @xmath7 .",
    "formally it is identical to the @xmath25-norm of the dose distribution @xmath12 restricted to a region @xmath7 of the patient . but",
    "@xmath26 is called @xmath27 and it has a biological interpretation .",
    "one associates a value of @xmath27 to each tissue type , but there is no agreement yet in the literature about these values .",
    "[ rem : dvh ] the dose - volume histogram refers to the graph of a function that is usually given the same name .",
    "this function , defined for each @xmath5 in equation ( [ eq : volfun ] ) , can be regarded as a volume function in the sense of @xcite .",
    "let us fix @xmath5 for the moment .",
    "the dose - volume histogram of a region @xmath7 is a function @xmath28 whose value is the volume of @xmath7 receiving at least dose @xmath8 . in other words",
    "it gives the volume of a region enclosed by two level sets of the dose distribution @xmath12 , namely those @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( this last level set will be a point ) .",
    "[ rem : treatpar ] any quantity that influences the dose distribution may be considered as a _ treatment parameter_. usually treatment parameters are _ beam intensities _ and _ beam angles _ , that is parameters of the treatment unit",
    "[ rem : planpar ] the object function @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq : objfun ] ) also depends on @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "such parameters might be called _ planning parameters_. here we will keep them fixed .",
    "the numerical optimization process based on a quasi - newton method converges locally to an optimum if the object function is at least twice continuously differentiable . in the sequel",
    "we will simply say differentiable . in current radiotherapy practice",
    "the object function is a function of treatment parameters , but only indirectly via dose - volume constraints and or eud constraints . here",
    "we will consider their differentiability properties .",
    "let us start with object functions only containing eud constraints .",
    "then @xmath33 is a weighted sum of local object functions involving only @xmath36 like in equations ( [ eq : objfun ] ) and ( [ eq : locobjfun ] ) . in this case",
    "the object function @xmath21 is differentiable .",
    "here we have to assume that the dose distribution is differentiable .    however , when the object function contains dose - volume constraints it is not always differentiable .",
    "this is due to the finite differentiability of the dose - volume histogram at critical values of the dose distribution , even when the latter is differentiable . since it is not immediately obvious how the differentiability of the dose - volume histogram as a function of dose affects the differentiability of the object function as a function of treatment parameters , we present the following explanation . essentially , the treatment parameters enter the argument of the volume function because in the presence of parameters , the critical values are parameter dependent .",
    "when treatment parameters vary , the dose distribution @xmath12 varies and in particular its critical values . thus a critical value may pass through @xmath8 .",
    "suppose @xmath37 is a critical point for @xmath38 ( a critical point can always be translated to @xmath39 ) .",
    "it can be shown , see section [ sec : proof ] , that for values of @xmath5 near @xmath40 and @xmath41 near @xmath39 , @xmath12 can be transformed to a new function @xmath42 . where @xmath43 is a @xmath5 independent local standard of @xmath12 with critical point at zero and critical value zero and",
    "@xmath44 is the critical value of @xmath45 for @xmath5 near @xmath40 .    using the previous we will show in section [ sec : proof ] that @xmath46 can be split into a global and a local part .",
    "the global part depends differentiably on @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider the local part in more detail .",
    "on a neighbourhood @xmath47 of @xmath39 we have @xmath48 the function @xmath49 is proportional to the volume in the expression above and the proportionality factor is a differentiable function of @xmath5 . the last line in the formula above shows the volume function @xmath50 for a region enclosed by level sets of @xmath43 . according to @xcite",
    "this function is not twice continuously differentiable at critical values of @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath49 is not twice continuously differentiable at values of @xmath5 for which @xmath51 this , in turn , means that the object function @xmath21 is not twice continuously differentiable at values of @xmath5 such that @xmath8 is a critical value of @xmath12 .    * remarks *    1 .   [ rem : gnotsmo ] the function @xmath52 in equation ( [ eq : locobjfun ] ) is not differentiable at @xmath39 .",
    "this alone would already imply that the object function in ( [ eq : objfun ] ) is not differentiable .",
    "however we will assume that we are in a situation like in remark [ rem : compro ] where we are looking for a compromise .",
    "this means we stay away from points where @xmath52 is not differentiable .",

    "only this parameter will be relevant for the example , we call it again @xmath5 , but now @xmath77 .",
    "thus for the second dose distribution we finally have the following volume function : @xmath78    now we construct the object function .",
    "first we scale such that @xmath79 .",
    "then the object function for the first dose distribution is @xmath80 the object function for the second dose distribution is given by almost the same formula , but @xmath70 is replaced by the volume function in equation ( [ eq : volfun2 ] ) .",

    "our final conclusion is that in practice the convergence of the optimization process is most likely only slowed down near @xmath53 .",

    "the volume function @xmath155 is only finitely differentiable with respect to @xmath154 at @xmath156 .",
    "now the volume of the second part is proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "the proportionality factor is of no concern because it originates from smooth coordinate changes and depends smoothly on @xmath5 .",
    "thus we obtain that the differentiability of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath5 is determined by that of @xmath158 .",
    "the latter is only finitely differentiable with respect to @xmath5 at those values of @xmath5 where @xmath159 . or , put differently , where @xmath8 is a critical value of @xmath12.@xmath124      1",
    ".   the statements and proofs in this section are valid for any dimension .",
    "therefore we have not specialized them to the case @xmath160 . in this respect",
    "finitely differentiable means less than two times continuously differentiable .",
    "2 .   the critical points of a parameter family of functions will generally be degenerate for certain parameter values .",
    "however we excluded this possibility because the volume function will be even less differentiable at a critical value when the critical point on the level set of this value is degenerate .",
