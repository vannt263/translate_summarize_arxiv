    "the generalization of random walks for quantum systems @xcite proved to be a fruitful concept @xcite attracting much recent interest .",

    "@xcite grover presented a quantum algorithm that can be used to search an unsorted database quadratically faster than the existing classical algorithms .",
    "shenvi , kempe and whaley ( skw ) @xcite proposed a search algorithm based on quantum random walk on a hypercube , which has similar scaling properties as the grover search . in the skw algorithm",
    "the oracle is used to modify the quantum coin at the marked vertex .",
    "in contrast to the grover search , this algorithm generally has to be repeated several times to produce a result , but this merely adds a fixed overhead independent of the size of the search space .",
    "there are various suggestions and some experiments how to realize quantum walks in a laboratory .",
    "the schemes proposed specifically for the implementation of qrws include ion traps @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite ( also experimentally verified @xcite ) , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , optical lattices @xcite , optical traps @xcite , optical cavity @xcite , and classical optics @xcite",
    ". moreover , the application of standard general logic networks to the task is always at hand @xcite .",
    "the idea of the scattering quantum random walk ( sqrw ) @xcite was proposed as an answer to the question that can be posed as : how to realize a coined walk by a quantum optical network built from passive , linear optical elements such as beam splitters and phase shifters ?",
    "it turned out that such a realization is possible and , in fact , it leads to a natural generalization of the coined walk , the scattering quantum random walk @xcite .",
    "the sqrw on the hypercube allows for a quantum optical implementation of the skw search algorithm @xcite .",
    "having a proposal for a physical realization at hand we are in the position to analyze in some detail the effects hindering its successful operation .",
    "noise and decoherence strongly influence quantum walks . for a recent review on this topic see @xcite .",
    "the first investigations in this direction indicated that a small amount of decoherence can actually enhance the mixing property @xcite . for a continuous qrw on a hypercube",
    "there is a threshold for decoherence , beyond which the walk behaves classically @xcite .",
    "et al _ analyzed sqrw with randomized phase noise on a @xmath0 dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "the quantum walk on the line has been studied by several authors in the linear optical context , with the emphasis on the effect of various initial states , as well as on the impact of decoherence @xcite .",
    "the quantum random walk search with imperfect gates was discussed in some detail by li _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who have considered the case when the grover operator applied in the search is systematically modified .",
    "such an imperfection decreases the search probability and also shifts its first maximum in time .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the impact of noise on the skw algorithm typical for the experimental situations of the sqrw .",
    "in particular , first we focus on photon losses and show that , somewhat contradicting the nave expectation , non - trivial effects such as the enhancement of the search efficiency can be observed . as a second type of errors",
    "we study randomly distributed phase errors in two complementary regimes .",
    "the first regime is characterized by rapid fluctuation of the optical path lengths , that leads to the randomization of phases for each run of the algorithm .",
    "we show that the classical limit of the skw algorithm , reached by increasing the variance of the phase fluctuations , does not correspond to a search algorithm . in the other regime , the stability of the optical path lengths is maintained over the duration of one run , thus the errors are caused by static random phases .",
    "this latter case has not yet been considered in the context of qrws .",
    "we found that static phase errors bring a significantly different behaviour compared to the case of phase fluctuations . under static phase errors the algorithm retains its utility , with the average success probability displaying a damped oscillatory behaviour that asymptotically tends to a non - zero constant value .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the scattering quantum walk search algorithm . in section [ sec : uniform ] .",
    "we derive analytic results for the success probability of search for the case when a single coefficient describes photon losses independent of the direction . in section [ sec : non - uniform ] .",
    "we turn to direction dependent losses , and present estimations of the success probability based on analytical calculations and numerical evidence . in section [ sec",

    "the quantum walk search algorithm is based on the generalized notion of coined quantum random walk ( cqrw ) , allowing the coin operator to be non - uniform accross the vertices . in the early literature",
    "the coin is considered as position ( vertex ) independent .",
    "the cqrw is defined on the product hilbert space @xmath1 , where @xmath2 refers to the quantum coin , and @xmath3 represents the graph on which the walker moves .",
    "the discrete time - evolution of the system is governed by the unitary operator @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coin operator which corresponds to flipping the quantum coin , and @xmath6 is the step or translation operator that moves the walker one step along some outgoing edge , depending on the coin state . adopting a binary string representation of the vertices @xmath7 of the underlying graph @xmath8",
    ", the step operator @xmath6 ( a permutation operator of the entire hilbert space @xmath9 ) can be expressed as @xmath10 in ( [ eq : s_gendef ] ) @xmath11 denotes the vertex index . here , and",
    "in the rest of this paper we identify the vertices with their indices and understand @xmath7 as the set of vertex indices . the most remarkable fact",
    "about @xmath6 is that it contains all information about the topology of the graph . in particular ,",
    "the actual binary string values of @xmath12 are determined by the set of edges @xmath13 .",
    "this is accomplished by the introduction of direction indices @xmath0 , which run from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in case of the @xmath16 regular graphs which are used in the search algorithm .    to implement the scattering quantum random walk on an @xmath16 regular graph of @xmath17 nodes , identical @xmath16-multiports @xcite",
    "are arranged in columns each containing @xmath17 multiports .",
    "the columns are enumerated from left to right , and each row is assigned a number sequentially .",
    "the initial state enters on the input ports of multiports in the leftmost column . the output and input ports of multiports of neighbouring columns @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "are then indexed suitably and connected according to the graph @xmath20 .",
    "for the formal description of quantum walks on arrays of multiports , we propose to label every mode by the row index and input port index of its _ destination _ multiport .",
    "we note that an equally good labelling can be defined using the row index and output port index of the _ source _ multiport .",
    "to describe single excitation states , we use the notation @xmath21 where the input port index of the destination multiport is @xmath22 , and the row index is @xmath23 .",
    "thus the total hilbert space can effectively be separated into some product space @xmath24 . to be precise",
    ", the additional label @xmath18 would be necessary to identify in which column the multiport is , however , we think of the column index as a discrete time index , and drop it as an explicit label of modes .",
    "thus a time - evolution @xmath25 can be generated by the propagation through columns of multiports .",
    "a quantum walk can be realized in terms of the basis defined using the destination indices , and we shall term it `` standard basis '' through this section .",
    "first , we recall that an @xmath16-multiport can be fully characterized by an su(@xmath16 ) transformation matrix @xmath26 .",
    "the effect of such multiport on single excitation states @xmath27 is given by the formula , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the single photon state with the photon being in the @xmath0 mode , i.e.  @xmath30 .",
    "we note , that a multiport with any particular transformation matrix @xmath26 can be realized in a laboratory @xcite . to simplify calculations it may be beneficial to choose an indexing of input and output ports such that the connections required to realize the graph @xmath20 can be made in such way that each input port has the same index as the corresponding source output port . therefore the label @xmath0 can stay unique during `` propagation . ''",
    "we emphasize that this is not a necessary assumption for a proper definition of sqrw , but an important property that makes also easier to see that sqrws are a superset of generalized cqrws .",

    "thus the mode labelled by the source indices @xmath0 and @xmath11 , is labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath32 in terms of the destination indices .",

    "the application of the two coin operators is conditioned on the result of oracle operator @xmath40 .",
    "the oracle marks one @xmath41 as target , hence the coin operator becomes conditioned on the node : @xmath42 when @xmath16 is large , the operator @xmath43 can be regarded as a perturbed variation of @xmath44 .",
    "the conditional transformation ( [ eq : pert_coin ] ) is straight - forward to implement in the multiport network .",
    "for the two coins ( [ eq : std - coin - pair ] ) one has to use a simple phase shifter at position @xmath41 in every column of the array , and a multiport realizing the grover matrix @xmath20 at every other position .",

    "one simply needs to connect the output ports back to the appropriate input ports of the destination multiport in the same column .",
    "this feed - back setup is similar to the one introduced in ref .",
    "we begin our analysis of the effect of errors on the quantum walk search algorithm by concentrating on photon losses . in an optical network ,",
    "photon losses are usually present due to imperfect optical elements .",
    "an efficient model for linear loss is to introduce fictitious beam - splitters with transmittances corresponding to the effective transmission rate ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : loss - scheme ] ) .    .",
    "the beam - splitters incorporate the combined effect of imperfections of the multiport devices , and effects influencing the state during propagation between the multiports ( e.g.  scattering and absorption ) . ]",
    "the simplest case is when all arms of the multiports are characterized by the same linear loss rate @xmath48 .",
    "the operator describing the effect of decay on a single excitation density operator can then be expressed as @xmath49 the total evolution of the system after one iteration may be written as @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to note that with the introduction of this error , the original hilbert space @xmath3 of one - photon excitations must be extended by the addition of the vacuum state @xmath51 . the action of the sqrw evolution operator @xmath47 on the extended hilbert space follows from the property @xmath52 . due to the nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : homloss_op ] ) and the extension of @xmath47 , one can see that the order of applying the unitary time step and the error operator @xmath53 can be interchanged .",
    "therefore , over @xmath54 steps the state of the system undergoes the transformation @xmath55    to simplify calculations , we introduce a linear ( but non - unitary ) operator to denote the effect of the noise operator @xmath53 on the search hilbert space : @xmath56 this operator is simply a multiplication with a number .",
    "it is obviously linear , however , for @xmath57 not unitary .",
    "the operator @xmath58 does not describe any coherence damping within the one - photon subspace , since it only uniformly decreases the amplitude of the computational states and introduces the vacuum .",
    "since all final statistics are gathered from the search hilbert space @xmath3 , it is possible to drop the vacuum from all calculations , and incorporate all information related to it into the norm of the remaining state . in other words",

    "using this notation , the effect of @xmath54 steps is very straight - forward to express : @xmath60 this formula indicates that inclusion of the effect of uniform loss may be postponed until just before the final measurement .",
    "the losses , therefore , may simply be included in the detector efficiency ( using an exponential function of the number of iterations ) .    applying the above model of decay to the quantum walk search algorithm",
    "we define the new step operator @xmath61 , and write the final state of the system after @xmath54 steps as @xmath62 adopting the notation of ref .",

    "it appears that as we start deviating from the original uniform distribution , an initial drop of efficiency is followed by a region where improvement shows some systematic increase .",
    "however , it is still an open question , whether it is really a general feature that for some values of @xmath134 the efficiency is always increased . on the other hand",
    "these plots provide clear evidence that for a significant number of cases the difference @xmath150 is positive . in other words , rather counter - intuitively , we can observe examples where increased losses result in the improvement of search efficiency . since the time evolution with losses is non - unitary , the improvement can not be trivially attributed to the fact that the grover operator is not the optimal choice for the marked coin .",

    "first , the time evolution of the success probability tends ( on a long time scale , @xmath198 ) to a finite , non - zero constant value .",

    "second , the early steps of the time evolution are characterized by damped oscillations reminding of a collapse .",
    "third , the smaller the phase noise the larger is the long time stationary value to which the system evolves .",

    "[ fig : phase - noise ] .    better insight into the above features can be gained by examining the shape of the individual runs of the algorithm with the given random phase configurations . as it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - noise - diff ] , the success probabilities for different runs display the typical oscillations around a non - zero value .",
    "they differ slightly in their frequencies depending on the random phases chosen , hence when these oscillations are summed up we get the typical collapse behaviour . also , since these frequencies continuously fill up a band specified by the width of the gaussian , we expect no revivals to happen later . for higher order hypercubes the success probability drops almost to zero for already very moderate phase errors , resembling a behaviour seen on fig .",

    "we studied the sqrw implementation of the skw search algorithm and analyzed the influence on its performance the two most common type of disturbances , namely photon losses and phase errors .",
    "our main result for the photon loss affected sqrw search algorithm is that the introduction of non - uniform distribution of the loss can significantly improve the search efficiency compared to uniform loss with the same average . in many cases , even the sole increase of losses in certain directions",
    "may improve the search efficiency .",
    "mostly based on numerical evidence we have set a lower bound for the search probability as a function of the average and variance of the randomly distributed direction dependent loss .",
    "we concentrated our analysis on two complementary regimes of phase errors .",
    "when the system is subject to rapid phase fluctuations , the classical limit of the quantum walk is approached .",
    "we have shown that in this limit the skw algorithm loses its applicability to the search problem for any pair of unitary coins .",
    "on the other hand , we showed that when the phases are kept constant during each run of the search , the success rate does not drop to zero , but approaches a finite value .",
    "the effect in its mechanism is reminiscent to exponential localization found in optical networks @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the long - time limit , static phase errors are less destructive than rapidly fluctuating phase errors ."
