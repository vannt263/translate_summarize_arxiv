    "recently , a new research field has emerged in condensed matter physics which is based on the findings that a spin - orbit interaction can lead to topological electronic phase transitions @xcite and the electron - electron interactions can produce these transitions @xcite .",
    "this new field makes it natural to ask what remarkable new properties and transitions might occur between distinct , competing correlated topological electron phases when the spin - orbit interaction is present .",
    "various researchers have proposed @xcite the hubbard model with spin - orbit interactions ( the kane - mele - hubbard model ) on a honeycomb - like lattice , as a starting point for answering these questions .",
    "indeed the density of states of the non - interacting version of the model on a honeycomb lattice has special features that point to special properties in its interacting version .",
    "in particular , if the hopping is nearest neighbor , a van hove singularity ( vhs ) exists in the non - interacting model s density of states ( dos ) at @xmath2 electron filling @xcite .",
    "this feature prompted several groups @xcite to suggest singlet superconductivity in the interacting model , and several others @xcite to suggest @xmath0 pairing in the low doped case .",
    "numerical simulations point to other novel states of matter tied to the strength of the electron - electron interaction and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in particular , if @xmath3 is the strength of the local coulomb interaction and @xmath4 the hopping amplitude to nearest neighbor sites , the hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice is known to have a semimetal phase at small @xmath3 and an antiferromagnetic one at large @xmath3 @xcite , and ground - state quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations performed at half - filling suggest a transition from a semimetal to an insulating antiferromagnetic state insulator when @xmath5@xmath63.5@xcite . on the other hand , other quantum monte carlo studies , such as the finite temperature determinant quantum monte carlo method @xcite ,",
    "find that strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate around half filling and strong ferromagnetic correlations dominate at less than 3/4-filling .",
    "accordingly , the kane - mele - hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice is an opportunity to study a variety of novel quantum critical and thermal fluctuations of itinerant charge carriers , with doping and interacting strengths being very relevant control parameters that may lead to new topologically - constrained states of matter . in this paper",
    "we study quantum fluctuations in the kane - mele - hubbard model via ground state quantum monte carlo simulations . because of the already observed strong magnetic fluctuations",
    ", we ask whether superconducting fluctuations exist in novel forms .",
    "a common view , supported by recent experiments @xcite , is that the magnetic fluctuations provide a glue for pairing and generally lead to unconventional superconductivity @xcite .",
    "relative to what we learned from past numerical studies on this model @xcite , at least two important questions remain : what happens to the pairing for dopings below the van hove singularity ? and how does the spin - orbit coupling affect the pairing at any doping ?",
    "in conjunction with these two questions , we can also ask whether @xmath1 spin triplet superconductivity is possible . a topological superconductor with @xmath1 pairing symmetry",
    "is the most elemental way in which a non - abelian topological state can emerge as the ground state of a many - body system @xcite and thus provides an ideal platform to construct a possible quantum computer @xcite .",
    "we address the questions stated above by using the constrained - phase quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to perform simulations not possible with more commonly used quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "as we show , our results reveal rich physics when both the spin - orbit coupling and the electron - electron interactions are strong . between half - filling and the filling at the vhs , we find that the @xmath0 pairing dominates . below the lower band",
    "vhs filling , we find strong triplet @xmath1 superconducting correlations .",
    "further , the effective pairing correlation is enhanced greatly as the interaction increases , and these superconducting correlations are robust against varying the spin - orbit coupling . on the basis of these results , we suggest that triplet @xmath1 topological superconductivity might be realizable in doped honeycomb - like materials @xcite or ultracold atoms in optical traps @xcite .",
    "the kane - mele - hubbard model @xcite on the honeycomb lattice is @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) where @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 are the nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping energy , the strength of the on - site repulsion , and the next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) spin - orbit coupling strength , respectively . here",
    "@xmath8(@xmath10 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath11 on site @xmath12 and @xmath13 depending on if the electron makes as  right \" or  left \" turn when going from site @xmath12 to site @xmath14 on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the constrained - phase quantum monte carlo method ( pcpmc ) @xcite is a generalization of the constrained - path method ( cpmc ) @xcite and is an analog of the fixed - phase generalization of the fixed - node diffusion monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "the pcpmc method has yielded very accurate results for the ground state energy and other ground state observables for various strongly - correlated lattice models @xcite and for atoms , molecules , and nuclei @xcite . the pcpmc method is sometimes called the phaseless method @xcite .    briefly , for a hamiltonian @xmath15 , the constrained - path method , as most ground state quantum monte carlo methods , projects to the ground state @xmath16 from some initial state @xmath17 via @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian and @xmath20 is the interacting part . here , @xmath19 is the hopping and spin - orbit parts of and @xmath20 it is the hubbard @xmath3-term . in the constrained - path method ,",
    "a hubbard - stratonovich transformation is applied to each exponential of the interaction . with the consequence of introducing distributions of auxiliary scalar fields into the problem , converting the exponential of the interaction into an exponential of a non - interacting term ,",
    "depends on imaginary - time dependent external fields . with an initial state being an ensemble of slater determinant ,",
    "the constrained - path method propagates one ensemble of slater determinants into another .",
    "the individual propagating determinants are called random walkers . at any step in the projection ,",
    "the projected state is a weighted sum of the walkers , @xmath21 . after a sufficient number of steps , the method begins to sample walker weights that represent those of the ground state wave function . for most fermion simulations these weights",
    "are generally not all non - negative and hence do not represent a probability distribution amenable to monte carlo sampling .",
    "this is called the sign problem .",
    "the constrained - path method approximately handles the sign problem , which is caused by a broken symmetry in the space of slater determinants , by eliminating any random walker as soon as @xmath22 .",
    "the presence of the spin - orbit interaction in the hamiltonian means the ground state can not be real .",
    "to ensure samples come from a real , non - negative distribution , the constrained - phase approximation generalizes the constrained - path condition : with a phase @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 two simple forms of constrained - phase method follow @xcite from replacing the walker by @xmath25 and eliminating the walker if @xmath26 or by @xmath25 which makes @xmath27 .    .",
    "comparisons of the energies ( total @xmath28 , kinetic @xmath29 , and potential @xmath30 ) , double occupancies and correlation functions ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 the spin and charge density structure factors ) of the two - dimensional @xmath33 hubbard model on different lattices .",
    "different rows correspond to ed , cpmc , and pcpmc results .",
    "the multi - column heading of @xmath34 lattice with @xmath35 refers to the hubbard model on a square lattice , that of @xmath34 lattice with @xmath36 to the hubbard model on a square lattice in a magnetic field with 1/4 of flux quanta per plaquette , and that of @xmath37 kmh model with @xmath38 to the kane - mele hubbard model with @xmath39 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     here we used the first constraint .",
    "other than this difference in constraint , and the algorithmic details of the constrained - phase method are the same as those in the constrained - path method @xcite .",
    "when no phase problem is present , the constrained - phase method in fact reduces to the constrained - path method . when no sign problem is present , the constrained - path method is exact .    in table",
    "i we show a comparison of the cpmc and pcpmc methods with exact diagonalization ( ed ) method for several different lattices ( square and honeycomb ) , electron dopings , and spin orbit interaction strengths .",
    "both the cpmc and pcpmc methods agree with each other and with the ed results for energies , double occupancies , and spin - spin correlations .",
    "the key point is that the pcpmc allows accurate simulations , as for two cases in table  i , not possible with cpmc or other fixed - node - like methods .     with nn ( b ) @xmath0 with nnn , ( c ) @xmath1 with nn and ( d ) @xmath1 with nnn .",

    "these fillings correspond to non - degenerate ground states .",
    "simulations performed at these fillings exhibit much smaller statisical variance in the measurements than those performed at other fillings .",

    "for the present lattice , @xmath74 corresponds to a separation of lattice sites about half the cell size . from another work @xcite , we know that ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate electron fillings below the vhs , and antiferromagnetic correlations dominate around half filling .",

    "the @xmath0 correlations continue to dominate over other pairing forms at @xmath61 , and the @xmath1 correlations continue to dominate over other pairings at @xmath62 .",
    "one interesting point is that when compared to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : soc001 ] , the pairing correlations with @xmath0 symmetry are enhanced as the spin - orbit coupling increases , while the @xmath1 pairing correlations are suppressed , but only slightly , by increasing the spin - orbit coupling . thus the correlations we are finding are quite robust , at least with respect to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the observed dependencies of the pairing correlations on filling and spin - orbit coupling can be understood from the fermi surface topologies .",
    "the fermi surface with different spin - orbit couplings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] at two electron fillings : ( a ) @xmath62 and ( b)@xmath61 . in each sub - figure",
