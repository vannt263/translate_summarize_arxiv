    "the advent of high - quality near - infrared instrumentation has opened up a new window on the birth sites of massive stars .",
    "the formation time scales of a massive star is short , of the order of 100,000 years .",
    "this means that the newly born stars are still deeply embedded in their parental molecular cloud .",
    "not much is known about the onset of the stellar wind or the initial rotation properties of young massive stars .",
    "occurring behind large amounts of extinction , inside their natal molecular cloud , these evolutionary stages can only be observed at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we have identified 38 ob type stars inside massive star forming regions ( @xcite ) using k - band spectroscopy .",
    "they are classified based on the classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "three o3-o4 stars are detected , while only a few o3 stars are known in our galaxy .",
    "the k - band spectra of the ob stars are in general similar to those of the ( more evolved ) ob stars located in ob associations and the field .",
    "this suggest that the k - band spectral properties of the very young ob stars are already indistinguishable from those of the more evolved stars .",
    "profile of 4 young o5-o6 v stars in comparison with a br@xmath0  profile of a o5v field star ( lower spectrum , right panel).,width=415 ]    a few stars classified as early o stars ( o5-o6v ) show a peculiar behaviour of the br@xmath0  line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : brg ] ) ; the line is either not present , in emission , or the profile is partly filled in .",
    "this might be caused by an enhanced mass - loss .",
    "however , this would only happen if the stellar mass - loss is as high as that of supergiants ( @xcite , lenorzer et al , these proceedings ) . veiling by dust or free - free emission is unlikely as the intrinsically weak lines like civ and niii are detected .",
    "contrary to the suggestion found in our data that the young stars possess a relatively strong wind , evidence has been presented for a class of young ob stars which have unusually weak winds for their spectral type ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    to distinguish between these two scenarios for the stellar wind of the youngest ob stars , a careful analysis of spectral lines sensitive to the wind density is needed .",
    "the br@xmath0  line in the k - band is not the best line for this analysis .",
    "br@xmath1  in the l - band is more sensitive to the stellar wind density ( @xcite ) .",
    "currently a observing program to obtain high resolution spectra of the br@xmath1  line with isaac on the vlt is underway ."
