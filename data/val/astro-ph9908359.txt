    "radial oscillations of non - rotating relativistic stars have been studied for over thirty years .",
    "methods for obtaining their spectra have been well established ( bardeen , thorne & meltzer  1966 ; see also chapter 26 of misner et al .",
    "1973 and the references therein ) , and have been applied to several equations of state ( see for example meltzer & thorne  1966 ) .",
    "these works were mainly motivated by consideration of stellar stability because general relativistic effects tend to destabilize stellar models @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of rotation on stellar oscillations is less well understood in a general relativistic context . as in the non - axisymmetric mode case ,",
    "the slow rotation approximation has been the only accessible way for investigating the eigenmode behaviour of rotating stars @xcite .",
    "recently , numerical relativistic hydrodynamic codes have been developed by several authors and some numerical simulations of rapidly rotating stars have been carried out .",
    "stergioulas et al .   and font et al .",
    "have shown that initial small perturbations around an equilibrium star evolved to a superposition of normal mode oscillations ( note that their hydrodynamic simulation is done in the fixed background spacetime .",
    "on the other hand , shibata et al .   have solved the full system of einstein equations to investigate the dynamical stability of rapidly rotating stars . ) .",
    "although the excitation and evolution of these modes in realistic situations should be investigated by time dependent hydrodynamic simulations , it is also important to study the mode behaviour along rotational equilibrium sequences by using linear perturbation theory .",
    "so far we have studied a few sets of non - axisymmetric eigenmodes of rotating stars in general relativity ( f - modes by yoshida & eriguchi  1997,1999 ; p - modes by yoshida  1999 ( unpublished ; presented at the 9th yukawa international seminar black holes and gravitational waves - new eyes in the 21st century- ) ) .",
    "these results have been obtained within the cowling approximation in which euler perturbations of the metric coefficients have been neglected ( see mcdermott et al .",
    "1983 and finn  1988 for a definition ; see lindblom and splinter  1990 for the accuracy of the method when applied to non - radial modes of spherical stars ) .",
    "apart from some low order modes , these results are in good agreement with those of the full perturbation theory including metric perturbations ( for comparison of the eigenfrequencies for slowly rotating stars , see yoshida & kojima  1997 ; for comparison of the neutral points of the cfs instability , see yoshida & eriguchi  1999 which compare the results with the one obtained by full computation of stergioulas & friedman  1998 and morsink et al .",
    "1999 )    it is therefore natural to expect that the cowling approximation could also be successfully applied to the _ quasi - radial _ modes which are the smooth extensions of the radial modes of spherical stars to rotating stars . in the present paper , we study quasi - radial modes by using the cowling approximation .",
    "contrary to the expectations , our results indicate that _ computations with this approximation can not reproduce the relativistic instability of spherical stars .",
    "_ this is plausible because the instability is essentially caused by the loss of balance between gravity and the pressure gradient , and in calculations of it even the small corrections of gravity can not be neglected . moreover",
    ", the phase cancellation of the perturbed gravitational potentials , which may be effective in the case of non - axisymmetric modes , can not be expected to happen for radial modes .",
    "see the appendix of the present paper for the comparison of two methods in the case of radial modes of non - rotating stars .",
    "although the validity of cowling approximation for rotating stars is not fully assessed , we here _ expect _ that at least a qualitative picture of the eigenmode dependence on stellar rotation could be studied by this approximation .",
    "the equation of state used here is the polytropic one , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the rest mass density , energy density and pressure of the stellar matter , respectively .",
    "geometrized units , @xmath4 , are adopted in this paper as well as @xmath5 , following font et al .  .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is the polytropic index .",
    "the adiabatic exponent of the perturbed matter is assumed to coincide with @xmath7 .",
    "the factor @xmath8 is another constant .",
    "each equilibrium sequence is computed with @xmath8 and @xmath6 fixed .    in the present study",
    "polar - like coordinates are used and the metric components are written as : @xmath9 the rotational axis is located at @xmath10 .",
    "the coordinates used in the actual numerical computation are surface - fitted ones @xmath11 which are defined as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the form of the stellar surface in equilibrium .",
    "the numerical method used here is basically the same as that in yoshida & eriguchi   where non - axisymmetric modes were investigated .",
    "a minor modification is needed to obtain the axisymmetric modes . in the case of non - axisymmetric modes ,",
    "the eulerian variable @xmath14 is explicitly set to zero at the centre of the star ( @xmath15 is the eulerian variation of the pressure ) . in the case of axisymmetric modes , however , this is not the case since the regularity of the solution requires @xmath16 to be zero at the stellar centre .",
    "therefore we simply modify the finite - difference scheme at the innermost grid points in our numerical code .",
    "moreover to avoid the coordinate singularity on the rotation axis , points on the axis are excluded from the computational region .",
    "most of the results shown in this paper are computed with a resolution of 40 uniformly distributed gridpoints in the radial @xmath17 direction and 10 in the angular @xmath18 one .",
    "the computational region is a quarter of the meridional section of stars , thus the range of the radial and the angular coordinates are @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    in figs .",
    "[ n05freq ] and [ n15freq ] the eigenfrequencies of the axisymmetric modes are plotted against the rotational frequency of the equilibrium model .",
    "the model parameters are tabulated in table [ eqmodel ] .",
    ".parameters of the stellar model . here",
    "@xmath21 is the rest mass density at the stellar centre , which is fixed as constant along the sequence . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gravitational mass and the mass - to - radius ratio , where @xmath24 is the circumferential radius . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ compare1d ]      comparing with the eigenfunctions of non - axisymmetric modes , we notice that the eigenfunctions of quasi - radial modes change their shapes significantly along rotational equilibrium sequences .",
    "for example , the radial distributions of the eulerian pressure perturbation and the radial component of the velocity perturbation change considerably near the equatorial plane of the star . the number of radial nodes of these functions increases as the stellar rotation rate increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall radial dependence of the @xmath25-component of the velocity perturbation changes little as the star spins up .",
    "therefore we can use the shape of this function as a tracer of the selected mode along the equilibrium sequence .",
    "the nomenclature of mode sequences is based upon the behaviour of the mode of a non - rotating star to which the sequence is continued smoothly .",
    "in addition to the polytropic case presented here , we have tried to compute quasi - radial modes of realistic neutron stars by using some of the candidate zero temperature equations of state .",
    "however it was rather difficult to obtain full sequences of these modes with our method .",
    "as the star begins to rotate , the convergence to the quasi - radial modes suddenly becomes much more difficult",
    ". this may partly be due to the fact that these modes are sensitive ( as compared with the non - radial modes ) to the surface condition of the equilibrium star .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of more realistic eos , the adiabatic exponent is subject to large oscillations , becoming negative in some parts .",
    "these large variations decrease considerably the accuracy of our method which then becomes inadequate .",
    "we thank luciano rezzolla for detailed comments on the manuscript , and john miller for his help to improve it .",
    "we also thank kji ury for useful discussions .",
