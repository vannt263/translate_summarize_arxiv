    "quantum memories based on single excitations stored in atomic ensembles in free space have found a variety of applications in recent years . they have been used to store single photons from various sources  @xcite , as well as photonic entangled states  @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated their application for the synchronization of independent quantum systems requiring heralded preparation , like single - photon sources  @xcite or parallel pairs of entangled atomic ensembles  @xcite , has also been demonstrated , an important task for various quantum information protocols  @xcite .",
    "these capabilities , together with the ability to generate complex entangled states between various memory nodes  @xcite , make such collective atomic memories an important alternative as building blocks for more general quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "for all these applications , an essential step is the final extraction of information from the atomic ensemble and its mapping into a light field , what we call here the reading process of the quantum memory .",
    "since there is no optical cavity in the system with a mode strongly coupled to the ensemble , the efficiency of this mapping relies critically on collective enhancement of the ensemble emission into a particular photonic mode  @xcite , besides its dependency with the usual quantities affecting the excitation of single atoms , like detuning and intensity of the exciting fields . such collective enhancement ,",
    "however , may have different natures , like the phase - matching of a nonlinear optical process  @xcite or the superradiant emission coming from a collective entangled state  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the reliance on collective enhancement implies the need of a large number of atoms in the ensemble and , then , of some transparency mechanism for the extraction of a single photon from the dense medium  @xcite .    the overall physical mechanism behind such reading process can be then quite complex , with various effects contributing to the final extraction efficiency of the stored information .",
    "previous theoretical works on this subject have treated the problem considering the propagation of quantum fields in the medium under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite .",
    "this approach has successfully supported various experimental works up to now  @xcite . however , for the calculation of the wavepacket of the extracted photon , it typically leads to numerical solutions , due to the complexity of solving a propagation problem in a dense medium with multiple energy levels and a strong driving field , as required to achieve both transparency and collective enhancement . in many of these previous works , there is also a focus on the combined problem of first mapping a previously free flying photon into the quantum memory and then taking it out during the reading stage  @xcite , with the measured and calculated efficiencies mixturing these two processes .",
    "this problem relies strongly on the detailed control of the propagation of photons in the atomic ensemble , and it is one of the main reason there has been such a large attention to propagation in the description of the reading process of such collective states . even though this combined problem is crucial for various applications , the collective state",
    "may also be generated in situ in a heralded manner , as first suggested in  @xcite and later employed in many experiments  @xcite . in this later case ,",
    "the efficiency of the reading process is completely decoupled from the writing process , since the reading only starts after the heralding of a succesful writing stage .",
    "the possibility of such decoupling is what enables our focus solely in the reading process in the present work .",
    "our approach to describe the dynamics of the reading process of such collective states , and the corresponding wavepacket of the generated photon , is quite distinct from those mentioned above , since we start by assuming that the transparency condition for the extracted photon holds in the sample .",
    "this condition is achieved by reading the ensemble with a very strong field , which `` opens '' the ensemble for the outgoing photon  @xcite .",
    "since the medium is transparent for the photon , we may neglect its propagation in the sample and consider the photon s output state to be the superposition of the independent contributions of all atoms in the ensemble , starting in a collective state containing a single excitation .",
    "this simplifies considerably the overall theoretical analysis .",
    "we consider then the hamiltonian evolution of the atoms of the ensemble interacting with the electromagnetic field of the reading laser and with the vacuum field .",
    "the evolution is a combination of rabi oscillations and spontaneous decay . however , since we are dealing with an initial collective state , the usual exponential decay due to spontaneous emission presents now a superradiant enhancement towards the state that leads to the photon extraction .",
    "in the end , we arrive at a simple analytical expression for the wave function of the extracted photon , that depends on the collective behavior of the atoms and on the properties of the reading laser field .",
    "we also include in the theory the main decoherence process in our particular experimental setup : the dephasing of the atomic coherences due to the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field in the sample .",
    "the deduction of an analytical expression allows us to analyze in a more straightforward and intuitive way the contribution of the various effects behind the reading process .",
    "we are able , for example , to isolate the collective enhancement coming from superradiance from that coming from the phase - matching of the underlying nonlinear process .",
    "we are also able to model the saturation of the reading process and its spectrum .",
    "the theoretical approach described in the previous paragraph was developed to model the experimental results obtained from our experimental setup to generate heralded single photons from a cloud of cold cesium atoms .",
    "this setup is described in detail in section  [ exper ] .",
    "it implements the protocol of  @xcite adapted for the generation of heralded single photons , as first proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it also applies the four - wave - mixing configuration for photon - pair generation introduced in  @xcite , and later reproduced and improved in the works of various groups  @xcite . in section  [ exper ]",
    "we also describe our method to measure the photon statistics of the light fields generated by the atomic ensemble , and which demonstrates their nonclassical nature . in section  [ sec : theory ] we develop then our theoretical model for the problem and obtain the analytical expressions to compare with the experiments .",
    "the series of experimental results with the corresponding theoretical curves are presented in section  [ sec - exper ] .",
    "the main parameters we change are the detuning and intensity of the reading field . in this way , we probe the wavepacket of the extracted photon in a wide range of conditions .",
    "we also obtain the total probability to extract the photon as a function of both intensity and detuning , revealing then the saturation behavior of the system and its spectrum .",
    "the results present an excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment , with the use of just a few fixed parameters to fit a large number of data . in this sense",
    ", we largely validate our simplified theoretical approach to the problem as adequate to describe such experimental system , by capturing the essential physical aspects of the problem .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we draw our conclusions and perspectives for future developments of this investigation .",
    "we are interested in studying the reading process of a quantum memory storing a collective atomic state encoded as a coherence grating in an ensemble of cold cesium atoms .",
    "the generation of such collective state follows the procedure originally sugested in the duan - lukin - cirac - zoller ( dlcz ) protocol for quantum repeaters  @xcite and implemented for the first time in the work of @xcite . in this way we consider an ensemble of three - level atoms in @xmath0 configuration , see figure  [ fig1](a )",
    "the two ground states @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to the hyperfine states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and the excited state @xmath5 to the @xmath6 .",
    "the cold ensemble is obtained from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , whose trapping and repumping lasers are turned off during the experiment period , see figure  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the trapping laser is turned off for 7  @xmath7s and the repumping , tuned to the @xmath8 transition , for just 3  @xmath7s . during 4  @xmath7s , the repumping laser",
    "is then employed to optically pump initially all atoms to @xmath1 .",
    "the mot magnetic field is kept on during the whole time , which implies in very short lifetimes , tens of nanoseconds , for excitations stored in the coherence between levels @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "after the initial state preparation , a 50  ns write pulse excites the @xmath9 transition , tuned @xmath10  mhz below resonance . as a result , with small propability an atom",
    "may be transfered to state @xmath2 with the simultaneous emission of a single photon in the @xmath11 transition , in the optical mode we call _ field 1_. the detection of a photon in field 1 heralds then the transfer of an atom to @xmath2 , but it is not known which atom in the ensemble made the transition . the ensemble is then left in a symmetrical collective state  @xcite that lives for as long as the coherence between levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 . since such coherence lifetime is small ,",
    "the readout of the memory is performed right after the end of the write pulse .",
    "the read field is a 300  ns pulse tuned close to the @xmath8 resonance , with a detuning @xmath12 .",
    "it maps an excitation stored in @xmath2 to another photon emitted now in the @xmath13 transition , in a mode we call _ field 2_. both write and read fields are produced inside a 1.5  @xmath7s period at which the avalanche photodetectors ( apds ) for fields 1 and 2 are turned on .    for the spatial modes of the exciting fields and detected photons we employ the four - wave - mixing configuration introduced in @xcite ,",
    "see figure  [ fig1](c ) , and later applied and perfected by various other groups  @xcite . in this way ,",
    "the write field is conducted by a polarization - mantaining ( pm ) optical fiber to the experiment region , and focused in the ensemble to a diameter of 400  @xmath7 m .",
    "the read field comes through a different pm fiber and arrives in the ensemble in the same transverse mode as the write field , but counterpropagating to it . for alignment",
    ", the write beam may be coupled to the read - beam fiber , and vice - versa , with about 70@xmath14 coupling efficiency .",
    "the photons are emitted counterpropagating to each other forming an angle of about 1@xmath15 with the direction of the write and read fields .",
    "they are also coupled to optical fibers , single - mode ( sm ) ones , whose corresponding transverse modes are focused to a diameter of 200  @xmath7 m in the ensemble . an alignment laser field coming out of the field 2 fiber may be coupled with about 55@xmath14 efficiency to the field 1 fiber . in such configuration field 2 is detected in the phase matched mode to field 1 , with correspondingly higher probability , since the write and read fields may be approximated by plane waves due to their larger diameter in the ensemble region  @xcite .",
    "phase matching also requires specific combinations of polarizations between the four fields .",
    "we setup then the write and read fields with linear orthogonal polarizations .",
    "the photons 1 and 2 have also linear polarizations , with the one for field 1 being orthogonal to both write field and field 2 .",
    "the polarizations of the various beams are fixed by the combination of polarizing beam splitters and waveplates shown in figure  [ fig1](c ) .",
    "configuration of levels participating in the photon - pair generation process , with indication of the transitions connected by write , photon 1 , read , and photon 2 fields , respectively , and their respective detunings , @xmath16 and @xmath12 , from the excited state .",
    "( b ) timing for the control pulses of fields and detectors participating in the experiment .",
    "( c ) general description of the apparatus , see text for details .",
    "pbs stands for polarizing beam splitter , m for mirror , apd for avalanche photodetector , and b for the mot magnetic field .",
    "half- and quarter - wave plates are indicated by @xmath17/2 and @xmath17/4 , respectively.,width=642 ]    after the photons are coupled to their respective optical fibers , they pass through sm fiber beamsplitters and reach two independent pairs of apds . the output of the apds are directed then to a counting card ( p7888 from fastcomtech ) , which record all photodetection events for later analysis by software , with 1  ns time resolution . in this way",
    "we may compute the various single @xmath18 and joint @xmath19 probabilities for all detection events in a single trial , with @xmath20 labeled in accordance to the respective photon . from these probabilities",
    "we may calculate , for example , three important normalized correlation functions : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the first two of these quantities measure the auto - correlations for each photon field .",
    "the third one measures cross - correlations between the two photon fields , giving the probability of generating a photon pair divided by the probability of observing an accidental coincidence event .",
    "the singular quantum nature of the correlations between fields 1 and 2 may be directly verified by the violation a cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath24 valid for classical fields  @xcite . since",
    "@xmath25 are typically bounded by a maximum value of 2 for our system  @xcite , we have that @xmath26 also indicates purely quantum correlations between the fields .",
    "this quantity is regularly employed in our work to provide direct inference on the quantum regime of the system , since it is much easier to measure than @xmath27 , which is plagued by the considerably smaller statistics on the measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    finally , another important quantity is @xmath30 , which provides the conditional probability of detecting a photon 2 once a photon 1 was previously detected in the same trial .",
    "most of the results concerning the dynamics of the reading process in the present work are related to measurements of @xmath31 , since it gives the probability to generate the photon 2 once the creation of the corresponding collective state is heralded by the detection in photon 1 . in this sense , @xmath32 carries very different information , since it is not directly connected to the reading of a stored collective state .",
    "all the above probabilities and correlation functions may be obtained after integration throughout the whole write and read pulse durations , or over a large portion of them .",
    "particularly , we denote by @xmath33 the integrated version of @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    ", we may also compute these quantities as a function of time inside each excitation pulse .",
    "this last measurement provides then the various wavepackets for the photons , together with the corresponding details of the dynamics of the reading process in real time .",
    "three wavepackets are of particular interest for us : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "since the purpose of this work is to treat the reading process of the atomic memory , our theoretical description starts with the state of the atomic ensemble after the writing process is complete . in this case , a writing laser beam with wavevector @xmath38 induces the transition @xmath39 in one of the atoms of the ensemble , and a photon in a specific mode selected by an optical fiber is detected by a photon detector .",
    "the annihilation operator corresponding to the selected optical mode is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the component of @xmath42 in the @xmath43 plane and @xmath44 corresponds to the annihilation operator for a plane wave mode with wavevector @xmath45 .",
    "for simplicity , we will not consider the polarization of the optical fields here and the corresponding atomic zeeman structure , approximating the atomic states by the three levels in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the function @xmath46 defines the mode , considered to be monochromatic .",
    "a quantum state with one photon in this mode can be written as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the creation operator for the mode and @xmath49 represents the vacuum state for the electromagnetic field .",
    "we can see the writing process as the coherent scattering of one photon of the writing laser beam , which is treated as a classical field , into one photon in the mode defined by @xmath50 , together with a corresponding change on the quantum state of the atom that scattered the photon @xcite . since there is a fundamental uncertainty about which atom scattered the photon , the probability amplitudes for the scattering by each atom must be coherently added .",
    "so the quantum state of the atomic ensemble at the time when the photon emitted in mode ( [ mode1 ] ) is detected can be computed by @xmath51|\\mathrm{vac}\\rangle|g\\rangle^{\\otimes n},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 represents the amplitude of the writing beam , the summation is evaluated over all atoms of the ensemble , each one at the position @xmath53 , and @xmath54 represents a state for the ensemble with all atoms in state @xmath1 .    while the atomic memory stores the information , decoherence processes affect the system , such that after a long time it is not possible to extract this information anymore . the principal mechanism of decoherence in our system is the zeeman interaction of the magnetic moment of the atoms with the magnetic field of the magneto - optical trap @xcite .",
    "the levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to hiperfine sublevels of the electronic ground state of cesium atoms , while the level @xmath5 corresponds to an excited state .",
    "all these levels have a nonzero magnetic moment , whose component in the direction of the external magnetic field varies along the ensemble .",
    "thus each atom , labeled by @xmath55 , has in general different values for the energies @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 of levels @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 , respectively . as the system evolves in time , the dephasing between different atoms increases , what causes a decrease of the coherence of the collective state of the atomic ensemble @xcite .    using the paraxial approximation @xmath59 , if the photon detection occurs at time @xmath60 , the quantum state of the atomic ensemble at time @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents a state in which atom @xmath55 is in state @xmath2 , all the others are in state @xmath1 and there are no photons in the system ( with the exception , of course , of the photons of the writing beam ) . if atom @xmath55 makes the transition @xmath39 , from time @xmath60 to @xmath61 it acquires a phase @xmath64 instead of a phase @xmath65 due to the hamiltonian evolution .",

    ", we can now proceed on finding the mode and temporal dependence of the photon emitted in the reading process .",
    "there are two possibilities for the system dynamics that lead to completely different behaviors for the emitted photon .",

    "there is no directionality on the photon emission and the information imprinted in the quantum memory is lost .",
    "other photons can be emitted in the process , since a transition @xmath74 can be further induced in atom @xmath55 .",
    "however , the quantum state of the atomic ensemble loses its coherence with the loss of the first photon , such that this second photon will also be emitted in a random direction and with no relation to the initial quantum state of the memory .",
    "so , if the atomic density of the ensemble is small such that there are no superradiance effects on the photon emission and @xmath153 for all @xmath55 , since the decay rates from level @xmath5 to levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 are approximately the same , there is a fundamental limit of 50% for the efficiency of this quantum memory even if all decoherence processes and losses are perfectly eliminated , and we have strong directionality in the @xmath13 emission ( see section  [ sec : superradiance ] ) .",
    "let us consider now the situation in which the wavevectors decomposition of the state of the emitted photon is given by @xmath146 with @xmath147 given by ( [ cc ] ) , such that the information imprinted in the memory is transferred to the extracted photon . to find the temporal dependence of the emitted photon we must perform a fourier transform on its frequency spectrum .",
