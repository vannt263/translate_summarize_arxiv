    "recent scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) data @xcite suggests that the charge density wave ( cdw ) in nbse@xmath0 is a topologically ordered bragg glass at least on the length scales ( @xmath1 unit cells ) accessible in the experiment .",
    "such a glass phase with a power law density correlation was predicted theoretically @xcite for three dimensional systems with a high density of weak pinning centers .",
    "however , analysis of the stm data suggests that the impurities in nbse@xmath0 are strong pinning centers.@xcite in this situation , conventional theories @xcite predict short - range order with a correlation length @xmath2 of the order of the average inter - impurity distance @xmath3 and with a proliferation of topological defects,@xcite in apparent contradiction to the experimental result . the nbse@xmath0 sample studied in ref .",
    "was found to have @xmath4 nm and @xmath5 nm , so the pinning centers are dilute on the scale set by the cdw coherence length .",
    "this dilute - pinning limit has not been extensively studied in the literature . here , we present a theoretical reexamination of the dilute impurity limit which indicates that in this limit unconventional and apparently previously overlooked physics occurs .",
    "this paper amplifies and extends results presented in ref .   in the context of an analysis of experimental data .",
    "our work builds on ideas introduced many years ago by abe,@xcite who pointed out the importance of the ratio between the coherence length @xmath2 and the average inter - impurity distance @xmath3 .",
    "a charge density wave is characterized by an amplitude and a phase .",
    "a strongly pinning impurity constrains the charge density wave phase to take a particular value on the impurity site .",
    "abe presented a scaling argument indicating that for impurities acting as strong pinning centers one should distinguish two cases .",
    "when @xmath6 the cdw phase simply interpolates between the values preferred by impurities leading to a correlation length of order @xmath3 . on the other hand , when @xmath7 , abe found that the preferred solution is for the phase to be very slowly varying , except in small regions of size @xmath2 around each impurity where the phase varies rapidly to accommodate the values preferred by the impurities .",
    "abe s analysis demonstrates the importance of the @xmath8 limit , but as will be seen below his analysis of this case is not completely correct .",
    "here , we reconsider the @xmath8 limit , finding that a screening effect arising from the long ranged nature of elastic forces makes the net effect of impurities weak at long length scales .",
    "the resulting state is stable , in the sense of having an energy gap for fluctuations .",
    "we also present numerical results confirming the main aspects of our arguments .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : sec .",
    "[ model ] presents the model we study and a formal solution .",
    "[ randomphase ] presents the details of an analytical solution of a simplified model in which the impurities are placed on the sites of a regular lattice , with randomness only entering in the values of the phases preferred by impurities ; effects of vortices and the periodicity of the pinning potential are also neglected .",

    "[ conclusions ] is a summary and conclusion .",
    "although our work is motivated by experiments on nbse@xmath0 , @xcite which has a three - component order parameter , for theoretical simplicity we consider here a generic one - component cdw in which the density modulation @xmath9 $ ] , and we take the amplitude @xmath10 to be constant .",
    "we also assume that all impurities have the same pinning strength @xmath11 , with randomness entering via the value @xmath12 of the phase preferred by the impurity at position @xmath13 .",
    "we believe that the qualitative behaviour we uncover is relevant also to the more complicated three - component , amplitude - varying case of nbse@xmath0 .    within our assumptions ,",
    "the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) energy density is reduced to the phase - only model,@xcite @xmath14 ^ 2 - v \\sum_{a}\\cos \\left [ \\theta_a - \\phi ( \\vec{x } ) \\right]\\delta\\left(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}_a\\right ) , \\label{phase_model}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the cdw phase stiffness ( elastic constant ) .",
    "we will focus on the three dimensional case , since both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies indicate that the cdw in nbse@xmath0 is not extremely anisotropic .    if eq .",
    "is taken literally as a model defined in the continuum , the phase variable is non - compact and vortices or antivortices are forbidden .",
    "however the model applies only at length scales longer than the cdw coherence length @xmath2 and physics relevant on the length scale of @xmath2 ( for example amplitude fluctuations ) allows vortex - antivortex excitations and makes the phase field compact . the model defined by eq",
    ".   arises also as the long wavelength limit of the lattice xy model of spins on a lattice with dilute random magnetic fields , but the short wavelength physics of this model may differ in details from that of eq .  .",
    "minimization of eq",
    ".   shows that @xmath16 obeys the laplace equation , @xmath17 for all @xmath18 not within a distance @xmath2 of an impurity site . under these assumptions ,",
    "the most general solution of the laplace equation is @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are parameters and eq",
    ".   applies only if @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 we regularize the formally divergent term in the sum as @xmath20 . to determine the parameters @xmath20 we substitute eq .   into eq .   and minimize the result with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "we focus here on the strong pinning limit , in which we expect that the phase @xmath24 , so we can expand the impurity potential up to second order .",
    "we find @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the integer @xmath28 accounts for the periodicity of the cosine potential . for a single impurity",
    ", @xmath29 simply increases the elastic energy compared to @xmath30 .",
    "we expect that with many impurities , @xmath29 solutions are generically energetically expensive , so we will focus on @xmath30 solutions for our initial analysis , and return to the effects of nonzero @xmath28 below ( see sec .",

    "is an analogue of a coulomb gas with the constraint that the potential take specific values on particular sites . minimizing eq .   in terms of @xmath20 , we find @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the identity matrix .",
    "substituting eq .   into eq .   and setting @xmath34 yields a total energy @xmath35 .",
    "the phase configurations given by the above expressions are in general found to be smooth although rare vortex - antivortex pairs occur .",
    "these are allowed because the regularization of @xmath36 introduced above in effect allows vortex cores of size @xmath2 . as will be seen below ,",
    "vortices are in practice induced by particular impurities that favor phase values very different from the average . in the calculations we have performed , however , the vortices are very dilute ( typically @xmath37 ; see below ) .",
    "the key physics of eqs .   and",
    "is that because of the long - range nature of the elastic forces in a laplacian problem , the phase at a given site is determined by the collective response at many impurity sites . to gain analytical insights into this physics we consider a simplified model in which the the impurities on the sites of a cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath3 and the randomness enters only through the values of the parameters @xmath12 .",
    "the kernels @xmath38 [ eq .  ] and @xmath39 [ eq .  ] are then defined on the points of the lattice of impurities and taking @xmath40 to be a vector within the brillouin zone of this lattice ( @xmath41 ) , we find @xmath42 while @xmath39 has the familiar screening form : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a characteristic length that is parametrically larger than @xmath3 , and @xmath45 denotes terms that are smaller by powers of @xmath46 and of @xmath47 relative to the terms that have been retained .",
    "abe @xcite considered a similar scenario but assumed a simple exponential form of @xmath48 instead of the screening form given by eq .  .",
    "the physics encoded in eqs .   and",
    "is that the physical cdw phase at any given point is determined collectively , with important contributions from impurities very far away , and this collective nature of the pinning suppresses the impurity - induced phase fluctuations .",
    "mathematically , the phase parameters @xmath20 that determine the effect on the cdw phase of an impurity on site @xmath22 are not independent , and indeed have long ranged ( coulombic ) correlations even for delta - correlated randomness @xmath49 . explicitly , use of eqs .   and leads to ( we have approximated the brillouin zone of the impurity lattice as a sphere of appropriate radius , because we are interested in the long length scale behaviour ) @xmath50 indicating that the phase - phase correlation is characterised by @xmath51 and , crucially , does not diverge as @xmath52 indicating that the root mean square phase fluctuation induced by the impurities remains bounded .",
    "thus , the average of the cdw order parameter @xmath53 is non - zero , so that even in the presence of impurities the model has long - range order in the ground state . in other words , the correlation function defined as @xmath54 with @xmath55 remaining non - zero as @xmath56 , since @xmath57 .",
    "we now consider states that are not the ground state .",
    "these may be generated in two ways .",
    "one may consider states of the form of eq .",
    "but with parameters @xmath20 that do not satisfy eq .  .",
    "these solutions will have very high energy , because they violate the pinning conditions .",
    "alternatively , one may consider solutions @xmath58 which correspond to elastic excitations about the ground state but with the pinning condition satisfied . to obtain such solutions",
    "we write @xmath59 @xmath60 does not obey the laplace equation , because the configuration does not minimize the energy .",
    "the @xmath61 [ whose dependence on @xmath62 is not explicitly notated here ] are determined by minimizing the energy for fixed @xmath62 , in particular insuring that the impurity pinning condition is fulfilled . substituting eq .   into eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 \\simeq   \\frac{\\rho_s}{2 } \\int d^3 x \\left ( \\nabla \\delta \\right)^2 + \\frac{v}{2}\\sum_a ( \\theta_a - \\sum_b k_{ab } \\bar{\\theta}^\\prime_b ) ^2\\\\ + 2\\pi \\rho_s \\xi \\left [   \\sum_{ab } k_{ab } \\bar{\\theta}_a^{\\prime } \\bar{\\theta}^\\prime_b + 2 \\sum_{a } ( \\delta_a -\\delta_0 ) \\bar{\\theta}^\\prime_a \\right ] , \\label{eofdelta}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the sawtooth function of @xmath66 introduced to recover the periodicity @xmath67 , and taken to be in @xmath68 $ ] .",

    "\\label{eofdelta}\\ ] ] to analyze eq .",
    ", we again consider the model in which the impurities are on a regular lattice of lattice constant @xmath3 and use eq .",
    "for the fourier transform of @xmath73 , obtaining finally @xmath74 since this is a positive definite , the ground state must have @xmath75 ; long - range order is preserved .",
    "the thermal fluctuation is @xmath76 where the second part is the ground state configuration with @xmath20 given by eq .  .",
    "the phase - phase correlation of the fluctuating part @xmath77 is found to be @xmath78 this function decays exponentially in terms of @xmath18 , and , thus , the long - range order still survives . the finite energy to excite the fluctuation originates from the fact that impurities fix the fluctuations at impurity sites to zero , @xmath79 .",
    "the analysis presented in section  [ randomphase ] relied on three simplifications : placing the impurities on a regular lattice , so that the randomness only enters via the value of the phase preferred by the impurities , neglecting vortex configurations of the phase field , and ignoring the periodicity of the pinning potential under @xmath80 . in this section",
    "we numerically investigate the consequences of relaxing these assumptions .",
    "we find that the simplifications do not affect the qualitative physics .",
    "however , there is a notable quantitative difference between the full model and the approximate model of section  [ randomphase ] arising from the effects of vortex - antivortex pairs , with correlation lengths changing by as much as a factor of two .    the probability that vortex - antivortex pairs will be produced depends both on the cdw stiffness @xmath15 and on the details of the short distance physics , which control the core energy of a vortex .",
    "specifically , the presence of a vortex - antivortex pair near an impurity site can allow the phase to relax rapidly from the value preferred by the impurity towards a background value , thus reducing the elastic energy . to estimate this energy",
    "we assume that the presence of the vortex - antivortex pair completely screens the impurity , so it is equivalent to removing one defect from the elastic energy .",
    "to estimate this effect we use the screened coulombic form of @xmath81 and note that the @xmath12 are random variables .",
    "we find the elastic energy gain is roughly @xmath82 the elastic energy gain is thus seen to depend on a property of the impurity , namely the phase change it produces , and on two properties of the cdw : the phase stiffness , and a short distance cutoff ( here specified by the correlation length @xmath2 .",
    "the net energy cost of creating a vortex - antivortex pair is thus the sum of @xmath83 and the core energy @xmath84 which general ginsburg - landau considerations suggest should also be of the order of @xmath85 . whether the total energy is positive or negative thus depends on @xmath86 and on an intrinsic property of the cdw , namely the ratio",
    ", @xmath87 @xmath84 depends on microscopic details beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "for example , in the xy model there is a significant elastic contribution@xcite suggesting that @xmath84 of the xy model may be larger than the one of the phase - only model , effectively leading to a smaller value of @xmath88 ; it is harder to make vortex pairs in the xy model .",
    "now we turn to the numerical energy minimization .",
    "we solved the matrix equation without any simplifying assumptions by placing impurities at random on the nodes of a @xmath89 lattice of lattice constant @xmath2 with randomly chosen preferred phases .",
    "note that putting the problem on a lattice is a particular way of imposing an ultraviolet cutoff and in particular permits vortices whose cores reside inside an elementary placquette .",
    "we calculated @xmath38 and @xmath39 numerically but neglected the periodicity of the pinning potential by setting ( at this stage ) the @xmath34 .",
    "[ phi_auto ] compares the analytical expression for the phase - phase correlation , eq .  , to results obtained by averaging the numerical solution of eq .   over 50 realizations of the impurity potential .",
    "we see that the analytical expression agrees well with the numerical results .",
    "a typical phase configuration of @xmath30 computed for an impurity density @xmath90 is shown in panel ( a1 ) of fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "it exhibits a smooth phase modulation with fluctuations of size @xmath3 .",
    "the lower panel shows the positions of the impurities as well as the locations of the vortices and antivortices .",
    "we see that vortices and antivortices occur only in tightly bound pairs , always near impurity sites .",
    "the density of vortices is very low ; @xmath91 .",
    "[ auto3 ] shows that the autocorrelation saturates at a non - zero value as the distance goes to infinity , with the value independent of the size of the system .",
    "we conclude that in this approximation model has long ranged order .",
    "we next consider the consequences of the periodicity of the pinning potential , by allowing configurations with @xmath29 .",
    "after minimization over the @xmath92 parameters the energy expression below eq",
    ".   then becomes @xmath93 which we now minimize as a function of @xmath28 . to do this",
    "we search for the lowest energy state in the @xmath94 space by a gradient annealing method .",
    "we start from the original state with @xmath30 , cycle through all @xmath22 . for each @xmath22",
    "we propose the change @xmath95 .",
    "if the change gives a lower energy , we accept it , and move onto the next @xmath22 ; otherwise , we do not update @xmath28 but still move on to the next @xmath22 .",
    "we repeat the procedure , cycling repeatedly over all impurity sites , until we get a converged result . for @xmath96 impurities ,",
    "about 5@xmath97 to @xmath98 of the impurities turn out to have nonzero @xmath99 .",
    "we do not observe @xmath100 bigger than 1 .",
    "initial states with randomly chosen @xmath94 from @xmath101 are always trapped in local minima with high energy .",
    "typical phase configurations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ phase](b1 ) , whose impurity distribution is the same as that of fig .",
    "[ phase](a1 ) .",
    "we can see from this figure that allowing @xmath29 removes strong local strains by introducing large fluctuations on a larger length scale than @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the phase fluctuations of size @xmath3 seen in fig .  [ phase](a1 ) disappear , leaving a bigger structure in fig .",
    "[ phase](b1 ) .",
    "the number of vortex - antivortex pairs increases significantly from @xmath30 solutions ( @xmath102 ) [ fig .",
    "[ phase](b2 ) ] .",
    "the average energy gain due to a change of one of the @xmath28 by unity depends on the concentration of the impurities ; it is well fitted by ( fig .",
    "[ n_var ] ) @xmath103 in the unit of @xmath104 . considering the number of @xmath29 ,",
    "this is a significant change in total energy ; the solution with all @xmath34 is of much higher energy than the state we found .",
    "we note that sites with @xmath105 occur mostly when @xmath12 is close to @xmath106 , while other impurities nearby prefer @xmath107 . since the number of impurities inside the sphere of radius @xmath51 grows as @xmath3 increases , the fluctuation of local phase at the center of the sphere , which induces the change of @xmath28 , decreases",
    "; thus , the energy gain due to changing the value of @xmath28 at a single site also decreases as @xmath3 becomes bigger .",
    "although the energy of the @xmath108 solution is higher than that of the true ground state , the conclusion that the system has long - range order does not change even if modifications of @xmath28 are allowed . for example , when we calculate the phase - phase correlation , now the average over the impurity phases is replaced by @xmath109 we find that the autocorrelation of @xmath28 s decays almost immediately over the average inter - impurity distance @xmath3 , indicating @xmath110 .",
    "similarly the correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath28 is found to be local .",
    "thus , essentially the calculation leading to the long range order does not change .",
    "the numerically obtained autocorrelation indeed indicate long ranged order , although the final value is much smaller than the value without @xmath28 variations due to the larger phase fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ auto3 ] ) .",
    "in order to test our analysis presented so far , and to further understand the physics of the model , we study the phase only model , eq .  , placed on a regular periodic lattice by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the model is now mapped to a three dimensional xy model with random and dilute magnetic fields , @xmath111 with adjacent sites @xmath112 , random impurity sites @xmath113 , and unit vectors @xmath114 .",
    "we consider the @xmath115 limit with the orientations of @xmath116 randomly chosen in the range @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "this model captures the same large - distance physics as the phase - only model , eq .  , while the short - distance properties are different ; in particular we expect that @xmath88 in eq .",
    "is smaller .",
    "we perform standard metroplis monte carlo simulations . during the mc steps",
    ", we do not update the spins on impurity sites .",
    "we will count eight overrelaxation steps and two metropolis steps as one mc step.@xcite starting from a cold initial condition , where all @xmath118 , the first @xmath119 mc steps are used for thermalization , and the following @xmath120 mc steps are used for measurements .",
    "we recorded observables every 25 mc steps .",
    "we have found that the autocorrelation time is at most 10 mc steps regardless of the size and temperatures ; it is relatively short due to the overrelaxation steps .",
    "the range of the acceptance rate for metropolis steps is from 40% to 60% .",
    "first , we focus on a low temperature , @xmath121 , to compare with the solutions of eqs .   and .",
    "typical phase configurations is given in fig .",
    "[ phase](c1 ) given the same impurity configurations as figs .",
    "[ phase](a1 ) and ( b1 ) . while both vortex - antivortex pairs and @xmath28 variations remove the local strain and lead to a similar structure in phase configurations , a small number of vortex - antivortex pairs in mc ( @xmath122 ) does not induce much phase fluctuations as @xmath28 variations",
    "; the larger value of @xmath84 in the xy model suppresses vortex - antivortex pairs . in fig .",
    "[ auto3 ] , the autocorrelations based on eq .",
    "are plotted for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "compared to the autocorrelations from the gl analyses , which show rapid saturation to non - zero values , the ones of the mc simulations show a relatively slow decay with no apparent saturation .",
    "furthermore , while there is very little size dependence in the gl calculations , the mc results depend on the size .    to further investigate this size dependence",
    ", we look at the end point value of the autocorrelations @xmath125 from @xmath126 to @xmath127 at various temperatures with @xmath90 ( fig .  [ auto ] ) . for temperatures well below @xmath128 ,",
    "this is well fitted by a power - law as:@xcite @xmath129 indicating quasi - long - range order .",
    "close to the transition , @xmath130 , the exponent increases to @xmath131 .",
    "similar size dependence are checked on magnetization with negligible difference on the values of @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , up to the size available for our simulations , our mc results indicate that the low - temperature phase has quasi - long - range order , with a low density of topological defects , i.e. , a bragg glass .",
    "however the bragg glass phase found here differs markedly from the conventional bragg glass phase with weak disorder;@xcite the correlation length exponent we find @xmath133 is much smaller than the conventional value @xmath134 .",
    "we do not have a definitive interpretation of the differences between our mc results and the results obtained by energy minimization , nor a clear account of the difference in exponent relative to the conventional bragg glass phase .",
    "one possibility is that the behavior revealed in the mc calculations is a crossover , visible over a much wider range because the short length scale physics of the xy model is different from that of the phase - only model . in this scenario",
    "the anomalously small exponent would be an artifact of the crossover region , with the true behavior being a saturation at longer scales .",
    "determining the behavior at longer length scales is an important open question .",
    "in summary , we investigated the effect of dilute ( inter - impurity distance long compared to coherence length ) but strong impurities on a cdw state .",
    "we find that an effect analogous to screening arising from the long range nature of the elastic forces associated with the pure cdw state substantially suppresses phase fluctuations and leads to a state with long ranged order .",
    "the state is characterized by a screening length parametrically larger than the inter - impurity distance .",
    "numerical simulations of two models ( the phase - only model , and a xy model ) , whose small wavelength limits are the same , confirm this basic picture .",
