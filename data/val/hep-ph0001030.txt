    "for the effective operators that do not change the higgs coupling to photons , the lhc possible bounds are weaker than the ones presently available , with the exception of the `` super  blind '' operator @xmath45 .",
    "we have also found that due to the presence of a sizeable interference between the anomalous and the sm contributions there is the distinct possibility that the anomalous higgs interactions dilute its decay into two photons and the higgs may be not observable in the above reactions .",
