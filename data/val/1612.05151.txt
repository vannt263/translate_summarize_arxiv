    "coherent superposition states are an important aspect of quantum systems @xcite , one which is believed to make possible their use for more efficient realization of energy and information manipulation tasks @xcite . in the last few years , much attention has been given for the development , analysis , and application of a resource theory for quantum coherence ( rtc ) .",
    "for a recent review , see ref .",
    "it is certainly worthwhile recognizing the existence of several levels of incoherent operations ( io ) in the rtc @xcite . naturally , depending on its properties , different coherence functions may or may not be a coherence monotone under a specific element of a given set of io @xcite .",
    "this kind of observation points for the need of further investigations concerning the similarities and differences among the properties enjoyed by varied quantumness functions .",
    "here we shall pay special attention to the geometric quantum coherence function which is obtained using hilbert - schmidt s distance ( hsd ) . although the possible non - contractivity under general quantum operations of the hsd @xcite demands care when of its application for quantumnesses quantification @xcite , it is a fact that the hsd has been a handy tool for a variety of investigations in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , recently it was shown that the hsd leads to an observable upper bound for the robustness of coherence , which is a full quantum coherence monotone @xcite .",
    "besides , because of its friendliness for analytical calculations , the hsd can be a useful tool for starting on quantumnesses quantification , as happened , for instance , with quantum entanglement and quantum discord @xcite .",
    "our main goal in this article is obtaining the hilbert - schmidt coherence ( hsc ) of multipartite qudit states and to use it to analyze the distribution and manipulation of quantum coherence in this kind of scenario .",
    "we shall then deal with two relevant - associated topics .",
    "we will look at the possibility of controlling the local and/or non - local coherences @xcite of a system by manipulating its local populations . and we will investigate the issue of a possible non - monotonic behavior of quantum distance measures under tensor products @xcite .",
    "the non - monotonicity under tensor products ( nmutp ) of a distance measure , investigated recently for the trace distance @xcite , is the possibility for an inversion in the dissimilarity relation between pairs of states when we consider their copies .",
    "that is to say , for four density matrices @xmath7 , it can happen that @xmath8 once there is no known analytical expression for the trace distance coherence for general states of systems with dimension greater or equal to three @xcite , and with the aim of unveiling the possible implications of the nmutp in quantum information science , here we shall analyze it using the hsd and look for its possible implications in coherence quantification .",
    "the remainder of the article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hsd_nqudits ] we make use of bloch s representation to write the hilbert - schmidt distance between two generic @xmath1-qudit states as an euclidean distance between the associated rescaled bloch s vectors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hsc_nqudits ] we use this result to obtain an analytical formula for the hilbert - schmidt coherence of @xmath1-qudit states .",
    "we instantiate this general result by looking at one - qubit ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qubit ] ) , one - qutrit ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qutrit ] ) , two - qubit ( sec . [ sec:2qubits ] ) , and two copies of one - qubit ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rho_rho ] ) states . after writing , in sec .",
    "[ sec:2qubits ] , the total hsc of two - qubit states in terms of its local and nonlocal parts , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rho_rho ] we study the possibility for controlling these quantities by manipulating the local populations of two copies of one - qubit states .",
    "the contrasting behaviors of hsc , @xmath6-norm coherence , and relative entropy of coherence in this regard are noticed .",
    "the non - monotonicity of the hsd under tensor products is investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmutp ] , where we report the first example of an important implication of this kind of property of a quantum distance function .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss related open questions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let @xmath9 , the @xmath10 identity matrix , and @xmath11 be a basis for @xmath5 .",
    "we can use these operators to form a basis for @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and to write any @xmath1-qudit state as @xcite : @xmath14 if the matrices @xmath15 satisfy the algebraic relations @xmath16 then the unit trace of @xmath17 requires @xmath18 . besides , the other parameters @xmath19 , which are the components of the so called bloch s vector , can be obtained as follows : @xmath20    now let s regard the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) @xcite , @xmath21 between two generic @xmath1-qudit states .",
    "using @xmath22 we shall have @xmath23 thus , if we define the components of the _ rescaled bloch s vector _ as @xmath24 with the analogous holding for @xmath25 , the hsd between @xmath17 and @xmath26 can be written as the euclidean distance between the @xmath2 vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29    we observe that if the generators @xmath30 are hermitian , then the distinguishability of the two states gains a nice physical significance in terms of differences between the corresponding pairs of observables mean values .",
    "notice that for this kind of generator we have , e.g. , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . for a generic two - qudit density matrix , ref .",
    "@xcite showed an optimized way to compute numerically the components of the associated bloch s vector ( the fortran code produced for that purpose can be accessed freely in @xcite ) .",
    "incoherent states , @xmath33 , are represented by density matrices which are diagonal in some reference , orthonormal , basis @xmath34 .",
    "that is to say @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 being a probability distribution .",
    "the hilbert - schmidt coherence ( hsc ) of a state @xmath17 is defined as its minimum hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) to incoherent states : @xmath37    for computing the hsc , one convenient choice for the @xmath5 generators is the @xmath10 generalized gell mann matrices @xcite : @xmath38 these three sets of matrices are named the _ diagonal _ , _ symmetric _ , and _ antisymmetric _ sets , respectively .",
    "the particular cases with @xmath39 and @xmath40 give the well known pauli and gell mann matrices , respectively .    if the reference basis is chosen to be the @xmath1-qubit _ computational basis _",
    "@xmath41 , with @xmath42 , then the presence of any non - null component of the bloch s vector corresponding to generators from the symmetric and/or antisymmetric sets implies in the presence of off diagonal elements in the density matrix .",
    "thus , the more general @xmath1-qudit incoherent state is obtained utilizing the identity matrix and the generators from the diagonal set : @xmath43 above we used the notation @xmath44 .    as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsd_nqudits ] ) , the hsd is given in terms of the sum of positive terms , which are equal to the square of the difference between corresponding components of the rescaled vectors .",
    "therefore , the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsc ] ) is obtained if we set @xmath45 for all @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus we see that the optimal incoherent state under the hsd is @xmath48    we shall define the _ coherence vector _ , @xmath49 , as the vector obtained using the components of the rescaled bloch s vector in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbv ] ) corresponding to one or more generators from the symmetric and/or antisymmetric sets .",
    "hence the hsc of a @xmath1-qudit state can be cast as the euclidean norm of this dimension @xmath50 coherence vector : @xmath51 in the next sub - sections , we exemplify the application of this general result to some particular cases .",
    "in this example @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "so , the one - qubit hsc is given by @xmath55 in this section , and in the remainder of this article , when there is no chance for confusion , we omit the density matrix in the expression for the mean values .      here",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "so , @xmath58      now @xmath59 , @xmath53 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 where the local part of the coherence was set to @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the one - qubit reduced states ( their hsc read as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c1qb ] ) ) . the non - local part of the coherence @xcite may be cast as @xmath64      as a special case of the class of states regarded in the last sub - section , let us look to two copies of one - qubit states : @xmath65 . for this kind of state",
    "we have @xmath66 and @xmath67    considering that the local populations are equal to @xmath68 with @xmath69 , we notice that although we can not control the local hsc by manipulating @xmath70 , we can change the non - local hsc by modifying the difference between those populations : @xmath71 .",
    "the result above is to be compared with the one for the @xmath6-norm coherence ( l1c ) , which , in contrast to the hsc , is a coherence monotone under the incoherent operations regarded in ref .",
    "the l1c is given by the sum of the absolute values of the off - diagonal elements of a density matrix .",
    "although @xmath72 is present in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath65 , it cancels out when we perform that sum , and we get @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "so , we can not control the non - local l1c by tuning local populations .",
    "because of its operational interpretation @xcite , the relative entropy of coherence ( rec ) may be considered to be one of the main coherence quantifiers introduced up today .",
    "the rec is defined and given by @xcite : @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the density matrix obtained by setting the off - diagonal elements of @xmath17 to zero and @xmath77 is von neumann s entropy . using the additivity of von neumann s entropy under tensor products , i.e. , @xmath78 and the fact that @xmath79 , we see that the rec is also additive under tensor products , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "so , we shall be able to change the rec of the two copies of @xmath17 only if we can change its own rec .",
    "an interesting result we report here in this direction is that , contrary to what happens with the hsc and l1c , we can modify the rec of a qubit by controlling its populations . for a qubit state ,",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83@xmath84 the form of the equation for @xmath85 is an indicative that the term @xmath72 , related to the populations , does not cancel out .",
    "we verify that this is indeed the case via an example , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rec ] .     for a fixed value of the @xmath6-norm coherence",
    "@xmath86 if we look at the bloch s sphere in the @xmath87 space @xmath88 , a constant value of @xmath89 ( or of @xmath90 ) will be associated with points in the lateral surface of a cylinder of physical states within the sphere . in this cylinder , for @xmath72 running from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , different values of @xmath93 shall lead to different values of @xmath94 .",
    "the uppermost and downmost circles of that cylinder surface touch the sphere surface , and in these circles lie pure states for which the bloch s vector norm , shown in the upper ( red ) curve , is equal to one . ]",
    "one can verify that , similarly to what happens with the trace distance ( td ) @xcite , the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) does not suffer from the non - monotonicity under tensor product ( nmutp ) issue for general pure states or for one - qubit collinear states .",
    "actually , one can show that this holds true for all @xmath95-norm distances @xcite . for general qudit states , the probability for random quartets of states to present",
    "the nmutp behavior of hsd decays with increasing the system dimension , also similar to what was seen for the td @xcite . for completeness ,",
    "we show such probabilities in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmutp ] .    .",
    "]    regarding the hilbert - schmidt coherence ( hsc ) , once @xmath96 we see that the nmutp behavior of the hsd can be revealed on its associated hsc if we manipulate @xmath97 accordingly ; what we will do by using an example .",
    "we will consider @xmath98 and @xmath99 , what gives us @xmath100 and @xmath101 so @xmath102 in order to invert the dissimilarity relation , we fix @xmath103 and change @xmath104 , which can vary from zero up to @xmath105 . as @xmath106",
    ", we can use e.g. @xmath107 to get @xmath108 , and consequently @xmath109    these last two inequalities are a manifestation of the nmutp of hsd : @xmath110 in the last equation we used the fact that , under the hsd , @xmath111 .",
    "in this article , we started obtaining a closed formula for the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) between two generic @xmath1-qudit states in terms of the euclidean distance between the corresponding normalized bloch s vectors .",
    "we used this result to derive an analytical expression for the hilbert - schmidt quantum coherence ( hsc ) of @xmath1-qudit systems .",
    "this formula was then exemplified in simple cases and we applied it to investigated issues related to the distribution and transformation of quantum coherence in some composite systems .    after splitting the total hsc of two - qubit states into its local and non - local parts , we analyzed the possibility of controlling these coherences by tuning the local populations of two copies of a generic one - qubit state .",
    "related to that matter , we observed some interesting contrasting behaviors of the hsc , @xmath6-norm coherence ( l1c ) , and relative entropy of coherence ( rec ) .",
    "we noticed that it is not possible to change the local hsc and l1c by tuning local populations .",
    "however , contrary the what was seen for the l1c , we can control the hsc by doing that kind of operation .",
    "the rec of two copies of a qubit state can be changed only if the local rec is changed , what we showed being possible by the control of local populations .",
    "this raises yet another bold difference among these coherence functions . in future works",
    ", it could be fruitful to investigate this kind of issue considering another coherence quantifiers .",
    "we have identified the first important implication of the non - monotonicity under tensor product ( nmutp ) property of a quantum distance measure .",
    "we showed that the nmutp of hsd , when applied to some states , can indicate that although a configuration @xmath112 is more coherent than another state @xmath113 , two independent copies of the first state possess less hsc than two copies of the last .",
    "we emphasize that we succeeded in doing that at this moment mainly because we used the hsd .",
    "this unexpected result , obtained for the hsd , calls for further investigations of the nmutp issue regarding other quantum distance measures and also considering other of its possible consequences .",
