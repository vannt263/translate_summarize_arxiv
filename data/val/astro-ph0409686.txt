    "cvs have been `` traditionally '' observed primarily at short wavelengths because accretion - generated luminosity , which peaks in the optical  ultraviolet , dominates the radiated energy of most systems .",
    "hence , relatively little is known about their infrared ( ir ) properties .",
    "investigating cvs in the ir contributes to the understanding of system components that are expected to radiate at these wavelengths , such as the cool outer disk , accretion stream , and secondary star . in @xcite",
    ", we presented an initial study of the group ir properties of cvs using the 2mass 2nd incremental data release ( 2idr ) , drawn from 525 valid targets located in the 2idr sky coverage .",
    "we present here the preliminary results obtained from extending this study to the 2mass asdr .",
    "our input target list for the 2mass asdr consisted of the 1320 valid cvs listed in @xcite as of 02 february 2004 .",
    "each cv was securely identified using optical finding charts from @xcite and/or other literature sources before matching it to an object in the 2mass asdr images and point source catalog .",
    "we could not recover the cv for 239 targets ( typically cvs in crowded star clusters , old novae near the galactic plane , etc . ) and could not securely identify the ir counterpart for 104 ( typically in regions where the ir field is very crowded ) .",
    "the locations of another 376 cvs were securely identified , but these systems were too faint to be detected by 2mass .",
    "the remaining 601 cvs were detected by 2mass ; of these , we classify 362 as `` good '' detections ( @xmath3 uncertainties less than 0.1 mag for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) , 165 as `` moderate '' detections ( @xmath3 uncertainty larger than 0.1 mag for at least one of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ) , and 74 as `` poor '' detections ( lacking a formal uncertainty for at least one of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 , indicating that the target is near the 2mass faint detection limit ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( left ) shows the ir color - color diagram of all `` good '' cv detections from 2mass .",
    "the loci of the main sequence ( ms ) , l dwarfs , and giant stars are shown as cross - hatched regions labelled with spectral types ( offset horizontally ) in normal ( ms , l dwarfs ) and italic ( giants ) fonts . the cvs located in outlying color regions ( e.g. , l dwarf region , lower right quadrant , etc . )",
    "may be mis - identified non - cvs or potentially interesting systems .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( right ) shows the ir color - magnitude diagram for cvs with distances determined from trigonometric parallax ( e.g. , @xcite ; etc . ) .",
    "the object closest to the l dwarf region is ef eri , a cv that is believed to contain a brown - dwarf - like secondary star @xcite .",
    "we are currently updating the input target sample to include all cvs in @xcite up to 01 september 2004 for final analysis of the ir properties of cvs , to appear in a future publication ."
