    "the most peculiar among the standard model fermions , the top quark has challenged the high energy physics community , both on the experimental and theoretical level , since its discovery in 1995 . from the theoretical viewpoint , its exceptional mass suggests that it might play a special role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this occurs in a number of proposed theories , including little higgs and top - color assisted technicolor , and even within many supersymmetric models . on the experimental side ,",
    "the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) for the top quark are still not fully tested . at the tevatron ,",
    "the high production threshold limited the number of @xmath0 events , and only now at the lhc will it be possible to perform precision measurements of the top quark s properties .",
    "while most aspects of the top quark agree so far with sm predictions , both the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations have reported an anomalous forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath0 pairs at intermediate to high invariant mass , much larger than expected from sm calculations @xcite .",
    "this result , which relies upon `` forward '' being defined relative to the tevatron s proton beam , can not be immediately checked at a proton - proton collider such as the lhc .",
    "however , it is well - known that forward - backward asymmetries at a proton - antiproton machine lead to differential charge asymmetries at a proton - proton machine , and indeed , a differential charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production , as a function of the @xmath2 quark s rapidity , should be observable .",
    "this quantity has been discussed by theorists , for instance in @xcite , and has been measured at the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "the statistical errors on this measurement are still rather large , however , and meanwhile the lhc s higher energy allows its experiments to probe for related phenomena in other ways .",
    "no significant problems with the sm calculation or the experimental measurements of the anomalously large asymmetry have been found .",
    "meanwhile , a variety of models have been proposed to explain it .",
    "most of these produce the asymmetry through the exchange of a new particle , either an @xmath3-channel mediator with axial couplings to both top and light quarks @xcite , or a @xmath2-channel ( or @xmath4-channel ) mediator @xcite with flavor - violating couplings that convert a light quark or antiquark to a top quark .",
    "both processes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ xplot1 ] . in @xcite , comparisons between different models are carried out , and study of those models or measurements in the lhc context can be found in @xcite .",
    "charge asymmetries at the lhc are known to be powerful tools for searching for and studying new physics , and recently this has been put to use in the context of models for the @xmath0 asymmetry . in @xcite a large overall charge asymmetry was used to argue the shelton - zurek model @xcite was most likely excluded ; a similar method was then applied for a different model in @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on models with @xmath2- or @xmath4-channel mediators , which , as we will see , often generate large charge asymmetries in @xmath1 ( top plus antitop plus a jet ) at the lhc .",
    "these asymmetries , a smoking gun of this type of model , will be crucial for a convincing discovery or exclusion of this class of models .",
    "note these asymmetries are _ not _ directly related to the tevatron forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath0 events , which translate at the lhc into the differential charge asymmetry in @xmath2 production mentioned above .",
    "the asymmetry in @xmath5 that we study here stems from a completely different source ; see below .",
    "any of the models with a @xmath2- or @xmath4-channel mediator has a coupling between a light quark or antiquark , a top quark , and a new particle @xmath6 , as in fig .",
    "[ xtchannel ] .",
    "it follows that the @xmath6 can be produced from an off - shell quark or antiquark in association with a @xmath2 or @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xplot2 ] . consequently ,",
    "as has been pointed out by many authors @xcite , it is important at the lhc to look for the process @xmath8 ( and the conjugate process @xmath9 ) , where @xmath6 in turn decays to @xmath7 plus a jet .",
    "a straightforward search for a @xmath2+jet resonance can be carried out , though it suffers from the poor resolution for reconstructing the resonance , large intrinsic backgrounds whose shape may peak near the resonance mass , and combinatoric backgrounds in the reconstruction .",
    "alternatively , one could attempt a cut - and - count experiment ; with appropriate cuts one can obtain samples in which the @xmath6 production contributes a statistically significant excess to the @xmath1 rate .",
    "but the @xmath1 background is not simple to model or measure , and systematic errors may be problematic .",
    "fortunately , the process shown in fig .",
    "[ xplot2 ] has a large charge asymmetry .",
    "the difference between quark and antiquark pdfs assures that the rate for @xmath6 production is different from that of @xmath10 production .",
    "( if @xmath6 is self - conjugate , same - sign top - quark production results , and is readily excluded @xcite ; we therefore assume that @xmath11 . )",
    "our approach in this work will be to suggest something a bit more sophisticated than a simple resonance search , using the charge asymmetries of these models to reduce systematic errors at a limited price in statistics .",
    "we will also propose other charge - asymmetric variables that can serve as a cross - check . as a by - product ,",
    "should any discovery occur , the asymmetry itself can serve as a diagnostic to distinguish certain classes of models from one other .",
    "as our benchmark model , we take a typical model with a @xmath2-channel mediator , a colorless charged spin - one particle which we call a @xmath12 . we will assume the @xmath12 couples a right - handed @xmath13 quark to a @xmath2 quark . while a theory with only these couplings would be inconsistent",
    ", we will assume this coupling generates the largest observable effects .",
    "one may say that we choose a `` simplified model '' , or `` model fragment '' , in which this coupling is the only one that plays an experimentally relevant role .",
    "we will see this point is not generally essential",
    ". include @xcite .",
    "there are also attempts to include the coupling of a @xmath12 with a @xmath4 and @xmath14 quark @xcite , but such couplings lead to a large charge asymmetry in single top production @xcite , now excluded by lhc data @xcite . ]",
    "the lagrangian we take for our simplified model is simply @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in the process in which the @xmath12 contributes to a @xmath5 final state .",
    "one contribution comes from @xmath17 and its conjugate @xmath18 , following which the @xmath19 decays to @xmath20 and the @xmath21 decays to @xmath22 .",
    "we will refer to this as `` @xmath3-channel production '' ( see fig .",
    "[ schannel ] ) .",
    "the @xmath12 also contributes to @xmath23 , and similar processes , through @xmath2-channel exchange ( see fig .",
    "[ tchannel ] ) .",
    "the cornerstone of our analysis is the observation that _ in the @xmath3-channel process , the negatively charged @xmath12 is produced more abundantly than the positively charged @xmath12 _ , because the negative @xmath12 can be produced from a valence quark , while a positive @xmath12 requires a sea antiquark in the initial state .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ schannel ] . )    the processes in figs .",
    "[ schannel ] and [ tchannel ] can in principle have non - trivial interference with the standard model background  a point which considerably complicates background simulation .",
    "but we have found that interference is not numerically important for certain observables , at least with current and near - term integrated luminosities . _",
    "all results in this paper therefore ignore interference ; however , with larger data sets , or when studying other models and/or using other variables , one must confirm on a case - by - case basis that this approximation is sufficiently accurate for the analysis at hand .",
    "_    in @xcite , the authors studied this model and fitted it to the @xmath24 asymmetry and total cross - section in cdf .",
    "( this was done prior to the dzero result that shows a smaller asymmetry with less energy dependence . )",
    "based on this work , we will take six benchmark points shown in table [ crosssections ] , with three values of the @xmath12 mass and two values of @xmath25 for each mass , a larger value that would reproduce the cdf measurement and a value @xmath26 smaller that would give a tevatron asymmetry ( and also an @xmath12 width and @xmath27 production rate ) of about half the size .",
    "the cross - sections at these benchmark points ( including all the processes shown in figs .",
    "[ schannel ] and [ tchannel ] ) are also given in table [ crosssections ] .",
    ".7 tev lhc tree - level cross - sections for the processes shown in figs .",
    "[ schannel ] and [ tchannel ] , for the various benchmark points .",
    "no k - factor is included in these numbers , but we do apply one later in our analysis ; for a discussion of the simulations and the k - factor , we refer the reader to sec .",
    "[ seceventselection ] . [ crosssections ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the greatest merit of the angle variable is its simplicity .",
    "both the hardest jet and the lepton are well - measured , and in contrast to the mass variables no ( partial ) event reconstruction is needed .",
    "unfortunately the angle variable is more sensitive than @xmath28 to interference effects between signal and background .",
    "whether the contribution from interference is positive or negative depends on the mass of new particle , the @xmath29 cut and the model we study .",
    "the effect , however , appears to be only moderate .",
    "we find that , for a @xmath12 mass of 800 gev and an @xmath29 cut of 700 gev , the asymmetry for the two bins after interference is included is reduced by about 15% . a more detailed study including interference is advisable to give a precise estimate of its effects , especially for other models where interference might be more important .",
    "at the lhc , models that attempt to explain the tevatron @xmath0 forward - backward asymmetry with the exchange of a particle @xmath6 in the @xmath2- or @xmath4-channel generate a charge - asymmetric signal in @xmath30 production .",
    "this leads to observable charge asymmetries in certain variables within @xmath1 samples . among interesting observables",
    "are mass variables involving various final state objects including the hardest jet and/or the lepton ( secs .",
    "[ secvar ] and [ secstat ] ) , the azimuthal angle between the lepton and the hardest jet ( sec .",
    "[ secangle ] ) and the @xmath31 difference between the tops and @xmath32 bosons ( appendix  [ appptdiff ] ) . of these variables , the invariant mass of the hardest jet , the leptonic @xmath32 and a @xmath14-tagged jet appears to be the most powerful and the most universal , since it tends to reconstruct the @xmath12 mass resonance .",
    "the charge asymmetry of this variable exhibits a negative asymmetry in the region of the @xmath12 mass , and a positive asymmetry elsewhere .",
    "we have proposed a data - driven method to extract a statistical significance from this asymmetry structure .",
    "one could of course go further by fully reconstructing the events , and directly observe that @xmath19 production is larger than @xmath21 production .",
    "however demanding full reconstruction would lead to a considerable loss of efficiency . since we can not realistically estimate this efficiency loss",
    ", we can not evaluate the pros and cons of this approach , but clearly the experiments should do so .",
    "we have described this asymmetry measurement on its own , without discussing the fact that simultaneously the experiments will be measuring charge - symmetric variables , such as the cross - section for @xmath1 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "of course these variables are complementary , and we do not in any way mean to suggest that one should do one instead of the other .",
    "charge - symmetric variables may often have lower statistical uncertainties , but in most cases background - subtraction is necessary , so there will be large systematic errors .",
    "the combination of the two types of measurements will help clarify the situation far better than either one could in isolation .",
    "additional information will come from the differential charge asymmetry in @xmath0 events at the lhc , which is a direct test of the tevatron measurement of the @xmath0 forward - backward asymmetry , and is sensitive to any growth of the effect with energy .",
    "a very important aspect of our approach is that the asymmetry is a diagnostic for models .",
    "an @xmath3-channel mediator will not generate a peak for either lepton charge , and so even if an asymmetry in @xmath33 were generated , it would be largely washed out in the variable @xmath28 . among models with @xmath2- or @xmath4-channel mediators",
    "@xmath6 , _ some will produce a negative asymmetry at @xmath34 , while others will produce a positive asymmetry .",
    "_ for example , models that replace the @xmath12 by a color triplet or color sextet scalar @xmath6 @xcite that couples to @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( and has charge 4/3 ) will have the opposite sign , because the process @xmath37 will be larger than @xmath38 .",
    "the approach we use will still apply , but the asymmetry will be positive in the neighborhood of the @xmath6 mass peak , rather than negative as it is for the @xmath12 .",
    "for this reason , _ even if it turns out that the asymmetry measurement is not needed for a discovery of the @xmath6 particle , it will still be an essential ingredient in determining its quantum numbers and couplings .",
    "_    what seems clear from our results is that the data already available ( or soon to be available ) at the 7 tev lhc should be sufficient to allow for an informative measurement of charge - asymmetric observables in @xmath1 to be carried out .",
    "we look forward to seeing studies of @xmath1 from atlas and cms , and we hope that measurements of charge asymmetries will be among them .",
    "we would like to thank sanjay arora , john paul chou , yuri gershtein , eva halkiadakis , ian - woo kim , amit lath , michael park , claudia seitz , sunil somalwar and scott thomas for useful discussions .",
    "we thank jiabin wang for insights in the statistical procedure and we thank olivier mattelaer for advice on the use of delphes .",
    "the work of s.k . and y.z .",
    "was supported by nsf grant phy-0904069 and doe grant de - fg02 - 96er40959 respectively .",

    "as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ contourplots1 ] and [ contourplots2 ] , we find that the optimal @xmath39-cut for the mass variable does not vary greatly with luminosity , or even with the @xmath12 mass : it lies around @xmath40 gev for the @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 gev @xmath12 and is slightly higher for the @xmath43 gev @xmath12 . at lower @xmath29 cuts ,",
    "reduced signal - to - background ratio worsens the significance .",
    "the reason a large @xmath29 cut works well even for low @xmath12 mass is that the distribution for the charge - symmetric component of the signal ( mainly @xmath2-channel @xmath12 exchange ) peaks at low @xmath29 for a lighter @xmath12 .",
    "meanwhile , for an overly high @xmath39 cut the remaining signal is too small .",
    "but we should mention that our binning procedure makes our results too pessimistic here .    when producing these contour plots , we choose a fixed binsize of 50 gev everywhere except in the upper and lower tails of the distribution , where we use a superbin .",
    "the superbins are sized so that that no bin ever contains fewer than 50 events . for higher",
    "@xmath29 , there are very few bins between the two superbins , and this makes the peak - valley - peak structure weak , ruining the significance of the measurement . within the white region in the upper left of the plots ,",
    "the number of events is so small that no bin with more than 50 events exists , and our binning strategy gives a null result .",
    "however , for a high @xmath29 cut one could choose a more sophisticated binning strategy . we have verified in a few particular cases that larger bins for higher @xmath29 cuts can restore some of the significance of the measurement .",
    "all of this is to say that sophisticated treatment of the data may lead to a somewhat better result than our simple - minded binning strategy would suggest .",
    "the plots below show the significance for exclusion of the sm hypothesis using the angle variable , along the lines of our method used for the mass variable .",
    "note the band of low significance for the @xmath12 with mass of 600 gev , caused by the shifting structure that we emphasized in sec .",
    "[ secangle ] ; for an @xmath29 cut of around 700 gev , the asymmetry shifts from one sign to the other . a study exploiting",
    "this dependence of the asymmetry on the @xmath29 cut would have larger significance , but we have not explored this option here .",
    "the detector simulation delphes produces particle candidates and requires the user to impose the isolation criteria of his or her choice .",
    "hence for each lepton candidate in the delphes output there will be a corresponding jet candidate , and it is up to the user to decide which one to include in the analysis . to facilitate",
    "this choice , delphes provides the user with the following variables for each lepton :    * @xmath44 : the sum of the @xmath31 of all the tracks with @xmath45 gev in a cone of @xmath46 around the leading track , excluding that track . *",
    "@xmath47 : the sum of the energy deposited in a 3@xmath483 calorimeter grid around the leading track , divided by the @xmath31 of that track .",
    "here we lay out the isolation criteria we imposed on the various particle candidates .",
    "an isolated electron is defined as an electron candidate for which @xmath49 gev , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for isolated muons",
    "we require @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally jet candidates are retained if no isolated leptons are found in a cone of radius 0.3 . when a previously isolated lepton is found in a 0.3 cone ,",
    "the jet candidate is identified with the lepton and therefore removed from the event .",
    "we hereby impose two consistency conditions :    * no more than 1 isolated lepton is found in a 0.3 cone * when one isolated lepton is found , the @xmath31 of the jet candidate can differ by no more than @xmath55 from the @xmath31 of the isolated electron .",
    "when one of these criteria is not met , we are unable to carry out a consistent isolation procedure and the entire event is thrown out .",
    "the efficiency of our isolation procedure is @xmath56 , both for signal and background samples .",
    "among other variables that show charge - asymmetries , ones of possible further interest include the difference in @xmath31 between the @xmath2 and the @xmath7 , or between the positive and negative @xmath32 bosons .",
    "since one top quark is recoiling against the @xmath12 , while the other top quark is a decay product of the @xmath12 , one would expect their kinematics to differ .",
    "the @xmath31 difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath57 is a variable in which this feature of the signal will manifest itself .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath32 bosons from the @xmath2 and @xmath7 decays . for each event",
    ", we can calculate @xmath58 the charge asymmetry at parton - level for these variables can be seen ( for pure signal ) in figs .",
    "[ trial1 ] and [ trial3 ] .",
    "although spectacular at parton - level , we find that the @xmath31 difference between the top quarks gets washed out a lot at detector - level by resolution effects and mis - reconstructions . nevertheless we encourage experimental colleagues to take this variable in consideration , since state - of - the - art top reconstruction methods might alleviate this problem . the @xmath31 difference between the @xmath32 bosons is less pronounced at parton - level , but does survive our detector simulation and the reconstruction of the hadronic @xmath32 .",
    "we find it is particularly useful for a low mass @xmath12 . like the angle variable , it changes sign as a function of the @xmath29 cut .",
