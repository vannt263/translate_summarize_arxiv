    "synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon often observed in coupled chaotic and hyperchaotic systems @xcite . depending upon the strength and the nature of coupling , various types of synchronization such as phase synchronization ( ps ) , complete synchronization ( cs ) , generalized synchronization , lag and anticipatory synchronizations , inverse phase synchronization ( ips ) and inverse synchronization ( is )",
    "have been observed in coupled dynamical systems .",
    "all these types of synchronization are achieved in ensembles of dynamical systems through some common coupling schemes , namely linear and nonlinear error feedback couplings @xcite , coupling via dissimilar and/or time - delayed variables @xcite , inhibitory coupling @xcite , coupling via dynamical relaying @xcite , adaptive coupling @xcite and also systems driven by a common noise @xcite , etc .    in many real world systems ,",
    "synchronization can occur due to interaction through a common dynamic medium and hence the systems also evolve similar to their environment under the influence of the latter .",
    "for example , let us consider the synchronization of self - excited nonlinear oscillators suspended on a movable elastic structure . in this case the oscillators interact with each other through the common elastic beam ( oscillators are excited by the vibrations of the structure ) .",
    "it has been shown that for given conditions of the elastic structure initially uncorrelated oscillations of each of the oscillators can synchronize with the frequency of the oscillations of elastic beam ( both inphase and antiphase synchronizations have been identified ) @xcite .",
    "other examples include synchronization of chemical and genetic oscillators @xcite , synchronized behavior with self pulsating periodic and chaotic oscillations produced by an ensemble of cold atoms interacting with a coherent electromagnetic field @xcite , synchronization of cells and in coupled circadian oscillators due to common global neurotransmitter oscillation @xcite .",
    "in all the cases , the coupling function has a dynamics modulated by the system dynamics . in this connection ,",
    "resmi et al  @xcite have recently shown and verified numerically the existence of various types of synchronization in low - dimensional chaotic systems which are coupled through a dynamic environment without intrinsic or coupling time - delay .",
    "time - delay systems are an important class of dynamical systems which occur in many real world systems and synchronizing such systems is having potential applications in diverse areas of science , engineering and technology @xcite due to their hyperchaotic nature . during the past few years , researchers are interested synchronizing such time - delay systems and mostly all known synchronizations and their transitions are identified and reported in two coupled time - delay systems using numerical simulations @xcite . in contrast , investigations on realizing synchronization in time - delay systems from an experimental point of view is very limited compared to their enormous theoretical results . in particular , despite the possibility of realizing time - delay systems using electronic circuits with some effort , experimental realization of most of the promising theoretical results remain largely unexplored using electronic circuits . experimentally generating and synchronizing such hyperchaotic electronic signals ( with multiple positive lyapunov exponents ) is very important where these signals may be used to hide secret messages in the area of secure communication and cryptography @xcite .",
    "further experimental realizations of theoretical concepts using electronic circuits with time - delay are being used as test beds before implementing them in photonics systems such as liquid state machines to achieve high speed processing , which are usually very expensive @xcite .",

    "we carry out these studies in two different coupling configurations , namely mutual coupling configuration where both the circuits and the environment are mutually sharing their feedback , and subsystem coupling configuration where both circuits are sharing their feedback with the environment , while only one of the circuits is receiving feedback from the environment . it is interesting to note that here synchronization occurs between the independently evolving system and the environmentally affected system .",
    "obviously this has important implications in actual physical situations and to our knowledge this problem has not been studied earlier . depending upon the coupling strength and the nature of the feedback ,",
    "we observe different types of synchronization transitions in the coupled circuits which include transition from nonsynchronization to cs via ps and from nonsynchronization to is via ips in both coupling configurations .",
    "snapshots of time evolution , phase projection and localized sets of the circuits as observed from the oscilloscope confirm the existence of different synchronized states experimentally along with corresponding numerical results .",
    "further , the transition to different synchronized states can be numerically quantified from the changes in the largest lyapunov exponents ( les ) , correlation of probability of recurrence ( cpr ) and correlation coefficient ( cc ) of the coupled systems as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "we also present a detailed linear stability analysis and obtain synchronization conditions for different synchronized states in the present system .",
