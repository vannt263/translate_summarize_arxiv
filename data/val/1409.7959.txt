    "we study the effect of hard - sphere collisions on the behaviour of groups of particles moving according to a velocity jump process , meaning that particles follow a given velocity and switch to a different velocity at randomly distributed times @xcite .",

    "ohtsuki and okano @xcite consider the difference between collective and individual diffusivity and show that both behave differently under the influence of interactions . in particular they show that interactions lead to enhanced collective diffusion , but reduced individual diffusion .",
    "bruna and chapman @xcite derive similar results using the technique of matched asymptotic expansions for particles in non - confined spaces .",
    "their results are further extended for multiple species @xcite and for particles in confined spaces @xcite .",

    "interestingly for values of @xmath16 greater than about @xmath206 the hard - sphere particles actually spread faster than point particles .    the second experiment shown in figure  [ subfig : robotics : kmcfvm : r ]",
    "plots the dependence of mdc on @xmath0 as we keep @xmath204 constant .",
    "we can see that the mdc decreases monotonically in the kmc simulations as well as in the pde models . the first correction does not provide a good match for @xmath0 bigger than about 5 ,",
    "whilst model  * ( iii ) * improves this match up to intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "we see that for large values of @xmath207 the kmc simulation spreads faster than both approximations , but slower than point particles .",
    "figure  [ subfig : robotics : kmcfvm : kappa ] presents the results for a constant value of @xmath158 .",
    "as is clear from the formulation of model  * ( ii ) * in , the first correction solely depends on @xmath158 and therefore provides a horizontal line in this case .",
    "the kmc simulations show higher values of mdc for lower values of @xmath0 , i.e. in a regime far away from the boltzmann limit . as we approach the boltzmann limit",
    "when @xmath208 , the kmc simulations converge towards the value provided by model  * ( ii)*. as should be clear from the definition of model  * ( iii ) * in , the second approximation undergoes a similar behaviour and provides a very good match to the kmc simulations throughout .    in the last experiment",
    "we keep the area fraction of particles in the simulation constant , i.e. @xmath209 and vary @xmath0 and @xmath16 . the kmc simulations , as well as the pde models , show monotonically decreasing values for the mdc throughout the considered parameter regime . investigating the forms of the first and second corrections in and respectively ,",
    "it becomes clear that the diffusion vanishes in the limit @xmath208 when keeping the volume fraction constant .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath158 goes to infinity in this limit .",
    "therefore , we should expect the kmc results to converge towards the mdc of the initial condition for large values of @xmath0 . in figure  [ subfig : robotics : kmcfvm : conc ] , we can see that model  * ( ii ) * provides significantly different results to the kmc simulations in this regime that is far from the dilute gas limit .",
    "model  * ( iii ) * does not provide a perfect match to the simulation results either , but provides a significant improvement over model  * ( ii)*.    we conclude from this numerical study that the first approximation ( model  * ( ii ) * ) provides a good match to kmc simulations when a system close to the boltzmann limit is considered .",
    "as one moves away from this limit and the area fraction becomes non - negligible , the second correction term ( model  * ( iii ) * ) provides an improved match .",
    "however , even this correction is only valid up to certain limits in area fraction @xmath148 .",
    "one would have to consider additional terms of the taylor expansion of the two - particle probability distribution to derive more accurate results for larger values of @xmath148 .",
    "we have studied the effect of reflective collisions ( [ eq : robotics : robocollision ] ) on the diffusive behaviour of a group of particles that follow a velocity jump process .",
    "these reflective collisions differ from the fully elastic collisions ( [ eq : robotics : elasticcollisions ] ) observed in gas molecules @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to study those reflective collisions , because they correspond more closely to behaviour seen in animal swarms @xcite , where animals aim to avoid each other but evidently can not transfer momentum .",
    "reflective collisions conserve speed and can be used for modelling systems where all particles move with the same speed .",
    "we have studied such systems in this paper by assuming that the velocity space is given by ( [ velspace ] ) .",
    "if we used elastic collisions ( [ eq : robotics : elasticcollisions ] ) , then some particles would have velocities @xmath210 after collisions .",
    "we would have to either adjust their speeds to @xmath163 by modifying the running part of the velocity jump process , or remove these particles from the system .",
    "new particles with speed @xmath163 would then have to be introduced to keep the number of particles @xmath0 constant @xcite .",
    "these technical issues have been avoided in this paper by using reflective collisions ( [ eq : robotics : robocollision ] ) .",
    "starting from the bbgky hierarchy @xcite we developed a number of pde descriptions that we compared numerically to results obtained from individual - based kmc simulations .",
    "the first model we introduced stems from the boltzmann equation @xcite that is used in fluid flow simulations @xcite . using cattaneo approximations @xcite we then study the effect which the additional collision term has on the diffusive behaviour of the group of particles .",
    "we show that in the dilute gas limit collisions are always slowing down the collective diffusion .",
    "we then attempted to move away from the dilute gas limit and to introduce finite sized particles , using a matched asymptotic expansion approach adapted similar to that in @xcite . using the cattaneo approximation again",
    ", we have derived equation ( [ eq : collisions : adjusted2:diffusion ] ) for the collective diffusion coefficient . this diffusion coefficient is larger than the one in the dilute gas limit .",
    "one can compare the results for velocity jump processes obtained in this work to the excluded volume methods in bd simulations @xcite by considering the limit @xmath211 , keeping @xmath212 constant . in this limit ,",
    "the adjusted diffusion constant given by equation takes the form @xmath213 which is indeed the form given by @xcite .",
