    "since einstein published a seminal paper on the brownian motion in 1905 , it became one of the most well - established subjects in statistical physics .",
    "the motion of a brownian particle has been studied in many works theoretically and numerically , and was extended later to lvy noise , lvy flights , lvy walks , continuous time random walks , fraction diffusion , etc .",
    "these extensions are being used to describe complex phenomena , e.g. , anomalous diffusive behaviors  @xcite or the diffusion limited growth and aggregation mechanisms  @xcite . for physicists ,",
    "the study of brownian motion led to a broad class of equations of motion containing various stochastic effects .",
    "especially , the langevin equation  @xcite is the most representative differential equation with the stochastic random forces of the white noises .",
    "mori  @xcite derived the generalized langevin equation with non - markovian noises , in which the memory kernel plays an important role .",
    "in contrast , the original langevin equation does not have a finite memory .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md )  @xcite is a computer simulation method to describe atoms , molecules , and even stars , interacting with each others in a closed system .",
    "since the interaction in molecular dynamics obeys classical mechanics , the positions and momenta of particles are calculated by numerical integration of newtonian equations of motion .",
    "it is important to note that the total energy of the system in md is conserved as the system moves along the trajectory in phase space . in this regard , the fundamental hypothesis of equal _ a priori _ probability in statistical mechanics ensures that the md simulation basically generates the microcanonical ensemble . in the computational point of view",
    ", the number of particles in md is often limited and far less than any real system because of the limitation in computer capacity . even with this drawback , md simulation has been proven to be an excellent approximation for investigation of a variety of classical quantities of real materials .",
    "the computational limitation by the all - particle approach in the microcanonical md can be overcome if one adopts a different approach .",
    "imagine that we can conceptually divide the whole system into two subsystems : one is composed of the degrees of freedom we like to trace , and the other is the environment system that plays the role of heat reservoir . in the md approach , we need to integrate all particles equations of motion .",
    "however , if it is possible to describe interaction by environmental degrees of freedom as stochastic random forces to the system variables , numerical integrations become much lighter simply due to the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom we need to trace . in this",
    "stochastic dynamics ( sd ) approach , we only need to integrate equations of motion for system particles , and effects from other environmental particles are handled as stochastic random forces that satisfy some given statistical properties .    in the present work",
    ", we use the md approach with total number @xmath0 of particles , the volume @xmath1 of the system , and the total energy @xmath2 fixed ( @xmath3 ensemble in md )  @xcite . in this md method , it is to be noted that the time evolution of the system is deterministic and only depends on initial conditions within numerical accuracy . during the md simulation , one",
    "is allowed to look at a single particle ( call it a brownian particle ) and consider every other particles as composing an environment system , applying forces to the brownian particle from time to time .",
    "this simple change of view allows us to make connection between the md and the sd approaches , which composes the main theme of the present paper . in equilibrium , the energy conserving microcanonical ensemble is equivalent to the energy fluctuating canonical ensemble in thermodynamic limit  @xcite in most situations , with some interesting exceptions  @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "the key question to pursue in our work is in what condition the ensemble equivalence between the md and the sd approaches becomes valid , in parallel to the ensemble equivalence between the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble in equilibrium statistical mechanics . in more detail , we simulate the md with the @xmath3 ensemble and observe the motion of a brownian particle in viewpoint of the sd .",
    "all the combined applied forces by other particles on the brownian particle are interpreted as the effective stochastic forces , and the motion of the brownian particle is compared with that from the simple langevin equation with stochastic random force .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : methods ] , we describe the details of our md simulation method and quantities to be measured .",
    "the obtained results are shown in section  [ sec : results ] in comparison with the sd approach of a brownian particle , which is followed by the summary in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "in our simulations , we use @xmath0 molecules of the identical mass @xmath4 in the presence of the truncated lennard - jones interaction called the wca ( weeks , chandler , and andersen ) potential  @xcite , which contains only the repulsive part of the lennard - jones interaction : @xmath5+\\epsilon , & \\mbox{for $ r < r_c$},\\\\ 0 , & \\mbox{otherwise } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 with the interaction length scale @xmath7 and the interaction strength @xmath8 .",
    "this representation of potential guarantees continuity of the potential and the force at @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we make equations of motion dimensionless by choosing @xmath12 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 as units of the length , the mass , the energy , and the time , respectively , and obtain @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes that the sum is over only molecules ( @xmath16 s ) satisfying @xmath17 . because the force term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : md ] ) does not depend on the velocity , we can use the following numerical integration scheme : @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the position @xmath20 , the velocity @xmath21 , the acceleration @xmath22 , and the discretized time step size @xmath23 .",
    "this method is called the leap - frog algorithm and it is easy to see that this is the second - order algorithm although it runs at the same speed as in the simple first - order euler method  @xcite .    in md simulations , a three - dimensional cubic box of the linear size @xmath24",
    "( the volume @xmath25 ) with @xmath26 ( in unit of @xmath7 ) under periodic boundary condition is used .",
    "the total number of particles is set to @xmath27 ( the number density is thus fixed to @xmath28 ) to make initial positions of particles fit to face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure , in order to avoid the huge amplitude of the force which might happen if the particles are scattered initially at random positions .",
    "the discretized time step in numerical integration is @xmath29 , which is small enough so that further decrease of @xmath23 does not change results reported in the present paper .",
    "the total simulation time is @xmath30 .",
    "we also verify that the total energy @xmath2 of the system is conserved within numerical accuracy .",
    "the total momentum should also be conserved and can be set to zero for convenience .",
    "the equipartition theorem @xmath31 with the boltzmann constant @xmath32 is used to calculate the temperature @xmath33 .",
    "we first generate uniform random velocities in [ -1,1 ] and shift them to make the total momentum ( or the velocity of the center of mass ) zero .",
    "the initial temperature @xmath34 is then computed from the equipartition theorem , and we scale the velocities according to @xmath35 to tune the system at the given temperature @xmath33 . as time proceeds ,",
    "the system approaches equilibrium and the temperature is computed ( call it @xmath36 ) again from the equipartition theorem .",
    "the deviation from the input temperature @xmath33 is removed by the second velocity scaling @xmath37 .",
    "after this procedure , we confirm that the temperature does not deviate much from the input temperature @xmath33 . in our @xmath3 ensemble md simulations ,",
    "the temperature is the control parameter and we use @xmath38 and @xmath39 in units of @xmath40 .",
    "it is then straightforward to numerically integrate the equations of motion  ( [ eq : md ] ) and all the presented results are obtained from the average over 100 independent runs .",
    "the key quantities we measure during simulation is the force @xmath41 [ the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : md ] ) ] and the velocity @xmath42 , which are then used to compute the velocity and the force autocorrelations defined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 being the average over particles ( @xmath48 ) , directions ( @xmath49 ) , and time ( @xmath50 ) , after a sufficiently long equilibration time ( see fig .",

    "a simple curve fitting of @xmath53 to the exponential function gives us the friction coefficient @xmath55 ( we use the subscript @xmath21 to indicate that it is computed from the velocity correlation ) , which are tabulated in table  [ tab : gammag ] .",
    "alternatively , the friction coefficient can also be found from the green - kubo formula for the force autocorrelation function  @xcite : @xmath67 in dimensionless form , where 3 in the denominator comes from the dimensionality .",
    "the cutoff time @xmath54 can be taken large enough so that the force autocorrelation function has arrived at plateau region  @xcite . lagarkov and",
