    "bistability , and multi - stationarity in general , is ubiquitous in biological systems ranging from biochemical networks to epidemiological and eco - systems @xcite .",
    "it is considered an important biological mechanism for controlling cellular and bacterial behaviour and developmental processes in organisms , and it is closely linked to the idea of the cell as a decision making unit , where a continuous input is converted to an on / off response corresponding to two distinct states of the cell @xcite .    the question of bistability therefore arises naturally in many contexts .",
    "many studies aim to demonstrate that in a given biochemical system , bistability can or can not occur @xcite .",
    "this has created some interest in formal methods that connect the network structure to the dynamic behaviour of the system , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one qualitative network feature has in particular been linked to multi - stationarity , namely the existence of a _ positive feedback loop_. a positive feedback loop consists of a sequence of species such that each species affects the production of another species , either positively or negatively , and such that the number of negative influences is even .",
    "the idea of associating positive feedback loops with bistability goes back to jacob and monod who introduced it in the context of gene regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "it was later formalised by thomas in the form of a conjecture @xcite , which was finally proved by soul @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "soul considers dynamical systems of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the vector of species concentrations , @xmath3 is the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the so - called species - formation rate function , which specifies the instantaneous change in the concentrations .    the work of soul is based on the so - called _ interaction graph _ @xcite .",
    "this graph encodes how the variation of one species concentration depends on the concentration of the other species .",
    "it is built from the jacobian matrix @xmath7 of @xmath6 evaluated at a point @xmath8 , such that the non - zero entries of @xmath7 corresponds to directed edges of the graph and the signs of the entries are edge labels .",
    "soul s analysis is mainly informative when the signs of the entries are independent of @xmath8 .",
    "he proved that the existence of a positive feedback loop in the interaction graph is a necessary condition for @xmath9 to have multiple zeros .",
    "in other words , it is a necessary condition for multi - stationarity to exist in the ode system .",
    "soul s approach usually works well when modelling gene networks , but it is often useless when modelling enzymatic signalling networks . in this case , the interaction graph rarely has constant labels .",
    "a related line of work , that remedies this short - coming and might be seen as a refinement of soul s work , is based on the so - called _ directed species - reaction graph _",
    "( dsr - graph ) @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 in is obtained from a reaction network , then it decomposes in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the stoichiometric matrix of the network and @xmath12 the vector of reaction rates .",
    "the dsr - graph uses this particular structure .",
    "the dsr - graph is a bipartite graph with nodes labeled by the species and the reactions of the reaction network .",
    "there is a signed directed edge from a species to a reaction if the species concentration contributes either positively ( positive edge label ) or negatively ( negative edge label ) to the rate @xmath12 of the reaction .",
    "there is an edge from a reaction to a species if the stoichiometric coefficient of the species in the reaction is non - zero . in this case",
    "the edge is labelled with the sign of the stoichiometric coefficient .",
    "compared to the interaction graph , the dsr - graph makes use of the explicit form of @xmath6 .",
    "the dsr - graph exists in different versions depending on the labelling of the edges ( signs versus stoichiometric coefficients ) and whether two opposite directed edges between the same node pair are combined into one undirected edge or not @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the existence of positive feedback loops in the dsr - graph is a necessary condition for the system to admit multi - stationarity @xcite .",
    "based on these results it has become standard to highlight positive feedback loops in multi - stationary reaction networks , eg .",
    "the loops are typically found using intuitive reasoning that might overlook the existence of other relevant positive feedback loops or might select positive feedback loops that are not related to the existence of multi - stationarity .",
    "here we provide a method , based on theoretical considerations , to classify _ all _ positive feedback loops of a multi - stationary network into those that are related to the observed multi - stationarity and those that are not .",
    "in other words , we determine the positive feedback loops that when broken , multi - stationarity disappears .",
    "the question needs to be understood in the context of the whole network and not in isolation : a particular positive feedback loop that is responsible for multi - stationarity in one network might appear in another network that can not have multiple steady states .",
    "we present an automated procedure to determine the positive feedback loops that contribute to multi - stationarity .",
    "the procedure is based on the _ injectivity _ property applied to an ode system of the form , as described in @xcite . in this context , we review the proof of the fact that positive feedback loops are necessary for multi - stationarity and how this relates to the dsr - graph .",
    "we illustrate the procedure with examples of multi - stationary reaction networks involved in cell signaling .",
    "we further consider the networks in the biomodels database @xcite and apply the procedure to all non - injective networks ( injective networks can not be multi - stationary , see below ) .",
    "this provides an overview of the landscape of relevant positive feedback loops occurring in documented reaction networks .",
    "we use the formalism of chemical reaction network theory ( crnt ) @xcite .",
    "an ode system is built from a set of reactions and reaction rates .      a _ reaction network _ , or simply a _ network _",
    ", consists of a set of species @xmath13 and a set of reactions of the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are nonnegative integers , called the stoichiometric coefficients . as a running example we use the network in figure [ fig : santos ] .",
    "it has three species , x@xmath16 , x@xmath17 , x@xmath18 , which are different forms of the cdk1-cyclin b1 complex , and four reactions @xcite .",
    "we denote the concentration of the species @xmath19 by lower - case letters @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution of the species concentrations with respect to time is modelled as an ode system in the following way .",
    "we let @xmath21 be the stoichiometric matrix of the network : @xmath22 that is , the @xmath23-th entry encodes the net production of species @xmath24 in reaction @xmath25 .",
    "the vector @xmath26 is called the _ reaction vector _ of reaction @xmath25 .",
    "the rate of reaction @xmath25 is a function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the set of possible species concentrations .",
    "a typical choice of @xmath30 is _ mass - action kinetics_. in this case @xmath31 with the convention that @xmath32 .",
    "putting the pieces together provides a model for the evolution of the species concentrations over time : @xmath33    returning to figure [ fig : santos ] , we let @xmath34 be the concentrations of x@xmath16 , x@xmath17 , x@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , one model of the network is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are parameters .",
    "it takes the form with @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "observe that the phosphorylation reaction @xmath40 has a reaction rate that depends on both the concentration of the reactant x@xmath17 and the concentration of the product x@xmath18 .",
    "we also consider an alternative model in which the rate of x@xmath17 phosphorylation depends on @xmath41 only : @xmath42 this alternative model is also consistent with the set of reactions in figure [ fig : santos ] , but the third reaction is now independent of the amount of x@xmath18 .      the specific form of implies that the trajectories of the ode system are confined to the so - called _ stoichiometric compatibility classes _ : @xmath43 where @xmath44 in @xmath45 is the initial condition .",
    "that is , the trajectories are restricted to the space spanned by the reaction vectors .",
    "of particular interest is the ( relative ) _ interior _ of @xmath46 , also called the _ positive stoichiometric compatibility class _ , given by @xmath47 .",
    "any trajectory that starts in @xmath47 , stays there , but might be attracted towards the boundary .",
    "a reaction network is said to be _ multi - stationary _ if there exist two distinct steady states in a positive stoichiometric compatibility class ( but not necessarily in all classes ) .",
    "equivalently , if there exist distinct positive @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "a network with one positive steady state and one steady state at the boundary is therefore not multi - stationary in this terminology .",
    "the reaction network in figure  [ fig : santos ] is multi - stationarity for some choice of parameters with the rate vector in @xcite , but not with the rate vector in ( which will be shown later ) .",
    "the concept of a positive feedback loop is associated with structural network properties and qualitative features of the reaction rates .",
    "therefore , we assume some regularity on the reaction rates that we encode into an abstract symbolic matrix , called the _ influence matrix_. a feedback loop does not depend on specific parameters or the specific functional form of the reaction rates .    to proceed , we assume that the function @xmath51 is strictly monotone in each variable @xmath52 and define the influence matrix @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 are symbolic variables .    the influence matrices associated with the two reaction rate vectors in and are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "all influences are zero or positive .",
    "we define the dsr - graph as a labelled bipartite directed graph with node set @xmath58 and such that :    a.   there is an edge from @xmath24 to @xmath25 with label @xmath59 if @xmath60 .",
    "b.   there is an edge from @xmath25 to @xmath24 with label @xmath61 if @xmath62 .",
    "we refer to the _ signed dsr - graph _ as the graph identical to the dsr - graph given by ( a)-(b ) , but with the labels replaced by their signs .",
    "the ( signed ) dsr - graph of the running example with @xmath11 as in and @xmath63 as in is shown in figure [ fig : santosgraph ] . the ( signed ) dsr - graph with @xmath63 as in is identical to that in figure [ fig : santosgraph ] , with the edge from x@xmath18 to @xmath64 removed .      a _ circuit _ in a graph @xmath65 is a sequence of distinct nodes @xmath66 such that there is a directed edge from @xmath67 to @xmath68 for all @xmath69 and one from @xmath70 to @xmath71",
    ". a circuit must involve at least one edge .",
    "the label of a circuit @xmath72 , denoted @xmath73 , is the product of the labels of the edges in the circuit .",
    "two circuits are disjoint if they do not have any common nodes .",
    "a circuit with positive label is a _ positive feedback loop _ , and similarly , a circuit with negative label is a negative feedback loop .",
    "the three positive feedback loops of the running example are shaded in figure [ fig : santosgraph]b .",
    "they correspond to shuttling of the complex between the nucleus and the cytoplasm , activation and deactivation of x@xmath17 , and self - activation of x@xmath17 ( the rate of reaction @xmath64 increases with @xmath74 , that is , the production of x@xmath18 increases with the amount of x@xmath18 ) .",
    "a @xmath75-nucleus is a collection of disjoint circuits which involves @xmath75 nodes @xcite .",
    "the label @xmath76 of a @xmath75-nucleus @xmath77 is the product of the labels of the edges in the nucleus .",

    "even ) number of species nodes and let @xmath79 .",
    "the sign of a @xmath75-nucleus is defined as @xmath80 .",
    "that is , if @xmath81 is a disjoint union of circuits , then @xmath82    in the dsr - graph , any circuit involves an equal number of species and reaction nodes and , hence , an even number of edges . consider a @xmath83-nucleus @xmath81 of the dsr - graph .",
    "we show that if none of the circuits are positive feedback loops , then the sign of @xmath84 is @xmath85 . indeed",
    ", if all circuits have negative labels , that is , @xmath86 for all @xmath87 , then @xmath88 because @xmath77 is a @xmath83-nucleus , it contains @xmath89 species nodes .",

    "we have that @xmath90 is odd for @xmath93 of the circuits and even for @xmath94 of the circuits",
    ". therefore , @xmath95 and @xmath96 if there are no positive feedback loops in @xmath77 .",
    "this result is also in @xcite , where it is stated using a different terminology .      in this section",
    "we study injectivity of the function @xmath97 , @xmath98 . in the next section we link this injectivity property for all positive stoichiometric compatibility classes to the non - existence of positive feedback loops in the dsr - graph . with other words ,",
    "if all feedback loops are negative then the function is injective on all positive stoichiometric compatibility classes .",
    "in particular , there can not exist two distinct points @xmath48 in the same stoichiometric compatibility class such that @xmath49 , that is , the network can not be multi - stationary .    to decide whether the function @xmath99 is injective on all positive stoichiometric compatibility classes for any @xmath12 with given influence matrix @xmath63 , we rely on a method previously developed by us @xcite .",
    "we will now explain this method .",
    "given a pair of matrices @xmath100 , we define a polynomial @xmath101 of degree @xmath102 , in as many variables as there are non - zero entries of @xmath63 . for this ,",
    "let @xmath103 and let @xmath104 be a basis of @xmath105 , which we assume to be gauss - reduced .",
    "further , let @xmath106 be the indices of the first non - zero entries of @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "we define a symbolic @xmath108 matrix , @xmath109 , by replacing the @xmath110-th row of @xmath111 with @xmath112 ( cf .",
    "* section 5 ) ) .",
    "the polynomial @xmath101 is defined as @xmath113 which can be written as a sum of terms depending on the variables @xmath55 , by expanding the determinant .",
    "each non - zero term is of the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a coefficient and all @xmath67 , respectively @xmath116 , are distinct .",
    "it is a result of @xcite that if @xmath101 is not identically zero and all non - zero coefficients of @xmath101 have the same sign , then the function @xmath99 is injective on each positive stoichiometric compatibility class and , hence , the network can not be multi - stationary . as a consequence , @xmath101 has coefficients of opposite sign whenever the network is multi - stationary .",
    "if the coefficients do not have the same sign , then the network might be multi - stationary , but it can not be concluded from the test .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath11 given in and @xmath117 in .",
    "we choose @xmath118 as a basis of @xmath105 and obtain @xmath119 there are both positive and negative terms , hence multi - stationarity can not be excluded . for @xmath120 in , the polynomial @xmath121",
    "is obtained from by setting @xmath122 , @xmath123 in this case all terms have the same sign and thus , the network can not be multi - stationary .",
    "this holds for any choice of rate functions with influence matrix @xmath120 .      in this section",
    "we link injectivity and the polynomial @xmath101 to positive feedback loops . it is shown in @xcite that each term of the polynomial @xmath101 can be identified with a _ collection _ of disjoint unions of circuits in the dsr - graph @xmath65 .",
    "specifically , given subsets @xmath124 of cardinality @xmath89 , let @xmath125 be the set of @xmath83-nuclei of @xmath65 with node set @xmath126",
    ". then @xmath127 where the sets @xmath128 in the sum have cardinality @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "* section 11 ) ) .",
    "when @xmath101 is derived from a `` reasonable '' reaction network , the predominant sign of the coefficients is @xmath129 .",
    "this is because , for most reactions , the species in the reactant complex will have positive influence on the reaction rate , and the species in the product complex will have negative influence ; if they influence the reaction at all .",
    "consequently , if the network is multi - stationary , then @xmath101 has _ some _ terms with the _ wrong _ sign , that is , with sign @xmath130 . since @xmath131 whenever @xmath77 does not contain positive feedback loops , we conclude that the network must contain positive feedback loops in order to be multi - stationary .    based on the above considerations , we develop a procedure to extract the positive feedback loops that correspond to terms with the wrong sign in @xmath101 .",
    "fix a non - zero term of the polynomial @xmath101 , say @xmath132 ( @xmath115 is positive ) and consider the following edges from species to reactions @xmath133 the @xmath83-nuclei corresponding to the term must contain these edges .",
    "therefore , we add to these edges all possible choices of @xmath89 edges from reactions @xmath134 to species @xmath135 such that the resulting graph is a @xmath83-nucleus . we keep only the nuclei @xmath77",
    "for which the sign of @xmath136 is @xmath130 .",
    "the positive feedback loops in these nuclei are those that _ do _ contribute to the existence of multiple steady states .",
    "indeed , if all these loops are broken , then the network can not be multi - stationarity .",
    "we find these loops in the signed dsr - graph .",
    "for example , consider the polynomial @xmath137 in and the dsr - graph shown in figure  [ fig : santosgraph ] .",
    "in this case , the rank of @xmath11 is @xmath138 , and hence we focus on the negative terms since @xmath139 .",
    "these are @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath142-nuclei are depicted in figure  [ fig : santosgraph](a ) : there are two 4-nuclei obtained as the union of the red circuit and one of the two blue circuits .",
    "the only positive feedback loop that appears is therefore the self - activation positive feedback loop , and this is the only loop that is related to the observed multi - stationarity .",
    "the other two positive feedback loops ( termed the spatial and the activation loop , respectively in figure [ fig : santosgraph](b ) ) are therefore not relevant for the observed multi - stationarity .      the procedure to select positive feedback loops that contribute to multi - stationarity consists of the following steps .    1 .   for a network with stoichiometric matrix @xmath11 of rank @xmath89 and influence matrix @xmath63 , compute @xmath101 and select the terms with sign @xmath130",
    "2 .   construct the dsr - graph .",
    "for each selected term of @xmath101 with the wrong sign , determine the corresponding @xmath83-nuclei of the dsr - graph that have the wrong sign .",
    "3 .   for each of the nuclei , select the connected components that form positive feedback loops .",
    "these steps have been implemented in maple and the script is available upon request .",
    "the procedure might fail for practical reasons ( such as lack of computational memory ) if the number of species and reactions is too big . in our experience",
    ", this number depends heavily on the sparsity of the influence matrix @xcite .",
    "we have applied the procedure to several multi - stationary networks .",
    "these examples are also in the maple script , together with some other systems such as the three - site phosphorylation system .",
    "we consider an ode model of histone h2a ubiquitination that involves the e3 ligases ring1b and bmi1 @xcite . when degradation of species is not taken into account , the model has @xmath143 species and @xmath144 reactions .",
    "we let b and b@xmath145 denote the protein bmi1 in isolation and targeted for degradation by ubiquitination , respectively . the protein ring1b is denoted by r , and r@xmath146 , r@xmath147 ,",
    "r@xmath145 denote three different forms of self - ubiquitinated r , with r@xmath145 being the form targeted for degradation .",

    "we investigated the models in the database pocab @xcite , which consists of 365 models from the publicly available database biomodels @xcite ( see also the page http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/ ) .",
    "the database pocab contains pre - computed stoichiometric matrices , mass - action exponent matrices , and kinetic data from the selected models .    in a previous paper @xcite we extracted influence matrices of the reported kinetics .",
    "of the 365 networks , 323 have strictly monotone kinetics such that the influence matrix is well defined . on these 323 networks we ran the injectivity method and ended up with a total of 64 non - injective networks , excluding 27 very large networks where the injectivity method failed ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "non - injectivity is a prerequisite for being multi - stationary .",
    "we applied the automated procedure on the 64 networks to determine the positive feedback loops .",
    "we obtained a total of 341 different positive feedback loops with size distribution shown in figure  [ fig : biomodels](c ) .",
    "most loops involve only 2 or 3 species ( 112 and 108 loops out of 341 , respectively ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : biomodels](a - b ) , we show the positive feedback loops involving one or two species and conclude that all possible types occur in the database .",
    "however , for two species , their frequencies vary from 9 to 35 ( out of 108 ) , indicating that the motifs are not equally represented in the database ( pearson s chi - square test , @xmath165 ) . for one species",
    ", there appears to be no difference ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "we show in table  [ table : biomodels ] the most frequent positive feedback loops for different number of species nodes .",
    "we have presented an automated procedure to find the positive feedback loops in a multi - stationary network .",
    "the procedure relies on structural and qualitative features of the network together with a kinetics , and it is insensitive to the specific form of the rate functions . only positive feedback loops that are contributing to the multi - stationarity of the network",
    "are reported , excluding those positive feedback loops that are not relevant .    whether a loop is relevant or not , depends on the entire dsr - graph of the network ( that is , the reactions and the influence matrix ) and not just on the loop itself . in this sense , being a positive feedback loop related to an observed multi - stationarity , is a context or network dependent property .",
    "this fact has also been observed in @xcite . in these papers , it is shown that the existence of a positive feedback loop fulfilling a certain extra condition is a requirement for multi - stationarity to occur . specifically , the loop must either intersect another positive feedback loop in a specific way ( called an _",
    "s - to - r intersection _ ) or fulfil a certain condition on the labels ( called an _",
    "s - cycle _ ) .",
    "the first possibility is network dependent .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there can be positive feedback loops that are s - cycles or that intersect another positive feedback loop in an s - to - r intersection without being relevant for the observed multi - stationarity .",
    "this is the case for most of the examples presented here .",
    "for example , the apoptosis network has another positive feedback loop , y@xmath167y ( all edges are positive ) , which intersects the loop on the right side in figure  [ fig : examples](d ) in an s - to - r intersection .",
    "the property of network dependence is further illustrated in figure [ fig : santosgraph](a)-(b ) , where the procedure is applied to the reaction network in figure [ fig : santos ] with influence matrix given by .",
    "the network models translocation and phosphorylation of a cyclin dependent kinase x in the onset of mitosis .",
    "only one of the three positive feedback loops shown in figure [ fig : santosgraph](b ) can be associated with multi - stationarity in the model , namely the self - activating loop that stimulates the creation of phosphorylated x@xmath18 in the nucleus . in @xcite , it is argued by different means than in this paper , that the spatial redistribution of the cyclin dependent kinase is important for creating the observed bistability .",
    "in contrast , our results suggest that the observed bistability is due to the self - activation loop of the phosphorylated complex in the nucleus",
    ".    the presented procedure can not establish whether a reaction network is multi - stationary or not .",
    "other means will here be required . if the procedure is applied to a reaction network that might or might not be multi - stationary , then the absence of positive feedback loops implies that the network can not be multi - stationary , whereas the presence of positive feedback loops leaves the question open .    whether a positive feedback loop found by the procedure is important in a biological or experimental context ,",
    "is not addressed in this paper , but must be established in other ways , for example by experimental verification .",
    "a reaction network might only be multi - stationary for very specific choices of reaction rates , which might not be relevant in a particular experimental setting .",
    "as the procedure is parameter independent , any such verification and subsequent interpretation is beyond the scope of the procedure .",
