    "quantum computation faces considerable hurdles , one of the most serious being engineering physical systems performing coherent operations without the deleterious effects of decoherence  @xcite , particularly in the solid state .",

    "underlying logical qec , a complementary strategy is to use hilbert subspaces which couple least to noise processes , decoherence free subspaces ( dfs )  @xcite .",

    "ideally , the logical states of the system should be eigenstates of the system hamiltonian when the system is idle , i.e. tunnelling should be suppressed on practical time - scales by @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the system can be tuned , via @xmath0 , such that the logical states are degenerate , hence ( known ) relative dynamical phases can be neglected .",
    "fluctuations of the electromagnetic environment superimpose inhomogeneities on the potential seen by the charge states . an electric field component along the axis of the qubit will cause a sloping potential  ( fig .",

    "furthermore , electrodes operating on nearby qubits will look like noise , i.e. it may only be practical to actively compensate for operations on nearest neighbors , but not those further away which may also cause unwanted perturbations .",

    "measurement in the logical basis can be achieved by a single electron transistor ( set ) adjacent to one of the dots in each qubit  @xcite , or by using multiple sets in a correlated mode  @xcite .",

    "the symmetrical distributions of charge ensure that each logical state acquires the same dynamic phase due to the external potential gradient .",
    "thus , an initial superposition acquires an _ overall _ dynamic phase which is unobservable .",
    "though linear spatially varying potentials have no dephasing effect on the 4qd qubit , charge trap fluctuators  @xcite may pose a problem  @xcite .",
    "an occupied charge trap has a @xmath13 potential , which perturbs the degeneracy of the dfs states . in principle",

    "\\label{eqn : manyfluct}\\ ] ] a taylor expansion of the solution  ( [ eqn : manyfluct ] ) about @xmath25 shows that the initial decay is parabolic @xmath26 independent of @xmath22 , and depends only on the effective coupling of the encoded qubits to the charge traps , @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : decaytimes]a ) .",
    "therefore , the short - term behavior will be dominated by the fluctuator that couples most strongly to the qubit , while the others mainly dampen further oscillations of the coherence vector ( fig .  [",
    "fig : typicaldecay ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the time it takes for the coherence to decay from @xmath28 ( maximal coherence ) to @xmath29 for @xmath29 close to @xmath28 , which is of crucial importantance in quantum information processing , is inversely proportional to the effective coupling strength @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the effective coupling strength for the two - dot and four - dot encoding respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : decaytimes ] b ) .",
    "thus , the ratio of the effective coupling strengths is a good measure for the superiority of the 4qd encoding versus the 2qd encoding ",
    "the former will be better provided that @xmath35 , and the larger the ratio the greater the improvement .",
    "the 2qd and 4qd qubits couple differently to charge traps , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 respectively , where @xmath38 is the distance between the qubit and each charge trap .",
    "the 4qd qubit has thus effectively a smaller `` horizon '' than the 2qd qubit .",
    "hence , generally a charge trap would have to be situated closer to the 4qd qubit than a 2qd qubit to induce the same decoherence .",
    "since the noise on the qubit is generally dominated by the closest fluctuator , whose typical distance is inversely proportional to defect density , the average relative effectiveness of the encoding is therefore expected to increase with decreasing charge trap density , which is confirmed by computer simultations ( fig .",

    "a total of 200 quantum trajectories were simulated and averaged .",
    "for all simulations , the 2qd qubit was @xmath41 nm long and the 4qd qubit was a @xmath41 nm square ( e.g. p donors in si , see ref .  ) .",

    "the mean charge trap spacing is comparable to the size of the qubit , leading to saturation effects.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the results in the previous section show that the 4qd encoding can substantially increase short - term coherence times for an ideal geometry .",
    "however , any physical implementation is likely to deviate from the perfect symmetry of the ideal quantum dot structure .",
    "the scheme s sensitivity to such deviations is thus an important practical consideration .",
    "non - ideal geometry , e.g. due to imperfect qd placement , will introduce a dipole moment , spoiling decoupling from external fields and reducing robustness to charge trap noise .",
    "however , as the magnitude of this dipole is comparable to , and linear in the displacement , and given that fabricational precision should be at least a fraction of qd spacing for qip purposes   nm accuracy ) of p donors in si has been demonstrated  @xcite . ] , the extra dipole for the 4qd qubit should be much smaller than for a 2qd qubit , hence the encoding should still offer a noticeable advantage .    to quantify the effect of asymmetry due to placement errors in the quantum dots",
    ", we performed extensive simulations computing the effective couplings for various randomly perturbed 2qd and 4qd architectures for different charge trap densities and a wide range of charge distributions .",
    "the simulations show that for reasonable errors ( @xmath44 placement error ) , the efficiency of the scheme is only modestly affected over a wide range of fluctuator densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perturb ] ) .",
    "( expressed as a fraction of the array side - length ) .",
    "this was repeated 1000 times for each of 500 fluctuator distributions .",
    "we plot of median w.r.t fluctuator distributions of the mean over the perturbations of the decoupling ratios as a function of error magnitude for different effective fluctuator densities .",
    "even with a 10% displacement error ( i.e. @xmath45 ) , the 4qd qubit is still effective.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we now consider implementing a universal set of quantum gates , @xmath46 . ideally , we would like all states involved during gate operations to belong to the dfs .",
    "this suggests an adiabatic holonomic control scheme  @xcite .",
    "however , the requirement of additional quantum dots for generating holonomies , charge symmetry constraints on auxiliary dot positioning , and the complexity of pulse sequences all offset possible advantages of holonomic control .",
    "alternatively , rapidly modulating tunneling between dots can implement the required logical gates quickly .",
    "if the gate time is short enough , transient population in non - dfs states , should have minimal coupling to electric field fluctuations .",
    "intra - dot charging should effectively suppress double occupation , which can be further enhanced by ensuring all spins are parallel so that each orbital can not have more than one electron .",
    "we describe the four dot system as a two - electron , four - site hubbard model .",
    "the electronic creation operators are defined @xmath47 for dots @xmath48 respectively , labelled in clockwise fashion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chargequbit]c ) .",
    "firstly , the phase gate ( a rotation of the bloch sphere by angle @xmath49 around the z - axis ) @xmath50 is achieved by biasing one pair of diagonally opposite quantum dots with respect to the other , @xmath51dt',\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the on - site potentials of the quantum dots defining the @xmath53 and @xmath54 states respectively .",
    "next , the @xmath55 gate requires inter - dot tunnelling .",
    "we allow tunnelling between dots @xmath56 and @xmath57 . allowing @xmath58 and @xmath59 tunneling as well",
    "leads to similar dynamics but at the expense of extra control electrodes and more non - dfs states involved . with vertical tunneling only ,",
    "the available state space is spanned by four states , @xmath60 .",
    "hence the hamiltonian with no tunneling is , @xmath61 in the above basis , and where we have taken the ( degenerate ) ground state energy to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the energy of the non - diagonal states @xmath64 due to coulomb repulsion of the two electrons .",
    "we now switch on equal tunneling with rate @xmath65 in the vertical direction , @xmath66 for convenience , we normalize @xmath67 , and scale @xmath65 relative to this .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath68 are @xmath69 where the eigen - energies are @xmath70 .",
    "tunnelling between dots mixes the states so that @xmath71 are no longer eigenstates of @xmath72 .",
    "transitions between @xmath73 and @xmath74 can not occur directly but only via transient occupation of the non - dfs states .    in order to achieve a @xmath75 rotation around an axis @xmath76 lying on the equator of the bloch sphere ( which is equiavalent to a @xmath55 gate up to @xmath77 rotations ) @xmath78 ,",
    "we require @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be rational .",
    "this leads to the conditions , @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "these requirements derive from the fact that the amplitudes of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 should be equal in magnitude when the amplitudes of the non - dfs states are zero , leading to @xmath85 , and the gate time @xmath86 .",

    "coulomb repulsion favors the diagonal charge configurations but transient population in the other states will still occur . for @xmath95 ,",
