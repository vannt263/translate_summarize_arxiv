    "much of the work on the luminosity distributions of rich clusters has been motivated by the results of henry  ( 1992 ) who found evidence for statistically significant negative evolution in the xlf ( fewer high @xmath3 clusters at higher z ) at @xmath9 for @xmath10 from 67 clusters in the _ einstein _ extended medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ) .",
    "recently , vikhlinin  ( 1998 ) have confirmed the emss result at @xmath11 for @xmath12 from a 160 @xmath13 survey from pointed _ rosat _ fields .",
    "they found a factor of 3 - 4 decrease in the number density of these high @xmath3 clusters as compared to a zero - evolution model .",
    "several other studies have claimed no evolution in the xlf out to redshifts as high as @xmath14 ( burke   1997 ; jones  1998 ; rosati  1998 ) . however , none of these studies have sufficiently large search volumes to address evolution in the xlf at the highest x - ray luminosities and thus do not contradict the original emss result .    of prime importance in any evolutionary study",
    "is an accurate determination of the _ local _ xlf as a baseline to compare with the distant cluster xlf . until recently ,",
    "even the local xlf was quite poorly constrained due to low cluster numbers .",
    "the largest local samples compiled to date are the x - ray brightest abell clusters ( xbacs ) ( ebeling  1993 , 1996 ) and the brightest cluster sample ( bcs ) of ebeling  ( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the bcs includes 199 x - ray selected clusters down to @xmath15 in the @xmath16kev band out to @xmath17 .",
    "consistent with most previous claims , no evidence was found for evolution in the xlf within @xmath18 ( ebeling  1998 ) .",
    "we have examined a statistically complete sample of 294 abell rich clusters within @xmath19 using the _ rosat _ all - sky - survey ( rass ) over the energy band @xmath20 as part of a multiwavelength study of nearby galaxy clusters . unlike most other studies , our sample is purely optically - selected within the criteria for inclusion in abell s catalog .",
    "there is some overlap with both the bcs and xbacs sample , with the primary differences that we have used only abell s northern catalog ( abell 1958 ) , and our x - ray flux - limit is approximately a factor of 8 lower than the bcs sample . our sample is larger than the bcs while our volume is nearly 30 times smaller . given our large sample size , we have reduced statistical errors in the local xlf for @xmath21 by up to a factor of 2 compared to previous work . combined with the poor cluster xlf of burns  ( 1996 ) ( bll96 ) , we examine the composite local xlf over more than 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath3 in order to understand the cosmological constraints imposed by the tight power - law shape noted in bll96 .    in section 2 we describe the sample , the derivation of the local xlf , and discuss the limitations imposed by our sample selection . in section 3",
    "we compare our new xlf with previous work . in section 4",
    "we explore the consequences of the shape of the local xlf with regard to press - schechter analytic predictions of the mass - function and possible constraints on @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we list our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we adopt @xmath24 and @xmath25 when dealing with the observational data .",
    "our cluster sample is derived from abell s northern catalog , and includes all abell clusters in the range @xmath26 with galactic absorption less than 0.1 magnitudes at r - band ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "see voges  ( 1999 ) and ledlow & owen ( 1995 ) for more details on the sample selection .",
    "the total sample includes 294 abell clusters .",
    "all clusters have measured redshifts and we include all richness classes in the sample .",
    "we calculate a survey area of 14,155 @xmath13 or 34% of the sky . within our observed volume",
    "we find the number density of clusters to be constant as a function of richness class and redshift suggesting that our sample is nearly complete and volume - limited within the limits of abell s selection criteria .",
    "these findings are consistent with those of briel & henry ( 1993 ) and mazure  ( 1996 ) with regards to the completeness of abell s catalog over this redshift regime .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function was derived from images produced by the rass as described in voges  ( 1999 ) .",
    "x - ray luminosities were calculated within a metric aperture of 0.75 @xmath28 mpc in diameter over the energy band 0.5 - 2 kev assuming a thermal spectrum with @xmath29 .",
    "corrections for missing flux were made according to the prescription of briel & henry ( 1993 ) ( using @xmath30 ) to produce a _ total _",
    "@xmath3 for each cluster over our _ rosat _ band .",
    "the primary effect of using a different @xmath31 would be to shift the total luminosities to higher or lower values ( a larger @xmath31 results in a smaller correction , thus lower total @xmath3 ) , while not significantly changing the shape or amplitude of the xlf within the error bars .",
    "voges  found a total detection rate of 83% for this sample of abell clusters .",
    "for non - detections , we adopt the @xmath32 upper - limits given in their table 1 . because of variations in exposure time ( and slight variations in galactic absorption ) across the sky with the rass , each cluster has a different flux - limit , or maximum volume to which the cluster could have been detected .",
    "we follow the prescription of avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) , and calculate the observed volume separately for each cluster .",
    "the volume is evaluated from @xmath33=0.016 to the maximum redshift at which the cluster could have been detected with a @xmath32 confidence . for clusters with only upper - limits to @xmath3 we set @xmath34 equal to the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the xlf is then found by calculating @xmath35 as the sum over all clusters divided by the maximum search volumes of each cluster .",
    "each binned data point is then found by dividing the above sum by the binwidth ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "for the entire sample , we find @xmath37 .",
    "error bars on the data points were calculated assuming poisson statistics following the prescription of rosati  ( 1998 ) .",
    "in figure 1 we show the differential xlf for our low - redshift cluster sample . also on this plot are the measurements of bll96 derived from 49 poor clusters and the bcs sample of ebeling  ( 1998 ) . the steady decline in volume - density observed in our rich cluster sample for @xmath38",
    "can be understood from the limitations of abell s optical selection criteria . because @xmath3 varies considerably for a given optical richness ( voges  1999 )",
    ", there are a significant number of optically poor clusters with @xmath3 in the range of richness class 0 clusters which are not in our sample .",
    "thus , our sample is truly volume - limited only for clusters above this cutoff in @xmath3 .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath39 , our abell cluster sample and the bcs sample are in excellent agreement .",
    "the bcs also extends to higher @xmath3 because of the larger search volume ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "our xlf shown in figure 1 is also consistent with that of edge  ( 1990 ) and briel & henry ( 1993 ) .",

    "the x - ray luminosity function derived from our low - redshift ( @xmath19 ) abell cluster sample ( solid circles ) , the poor - cluster data points from burns  ( 1996 ) ( open squares ) , and the xlf from the brightest - cluster sample ( bcs ) of ebeling  ( 1998 ) ( open circles ) .",
    "the local , differential xlf is remarkably well represented by a power - law over more than three orders of magnitude in @xmath3 .",
    "the high luminosity break in the xlf occurs at @xmath40 , and can be seen when we include the highest luminosity point from the bcs sample . using the combined xlf of bll96 and our new determination of the local rich - cluster xlf ( for @xmath41 ) , we find a power - law fit of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath44 and k is in units of @xmath45 .",
    "we find best - fit values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for completeness",
    ", we also fit a schechter function after including the highest - l@xmath48 point from the bcs . for a fit of the form : @xmath49 , we find a=@xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , and @xmath54",
    ". these values are consistent within the errors to the bcs , the rdcs xlf ( rosati  1998 ) out to z=0.6 , and the southern sharc survey ( burke  1997 ) for @xmath55 .",
    "note that these results do not conflict with the claimed negative evolution in the xlf observed by henry  ( 1992 ) , and most recently by vikhlinin   ( 1998 ) at the highest luminosities .",
    "as noted by bll96 , the remarkable power - law shape over such a large range in @xmath3 suggests a continuity in that the bulk x - ray properties of poor clusters must not be fundamentally different from richer systems .",
    "we explore the consequences of this result in the next section .",
    "in order to assess the constraints our local xlf imposes on cosmological models , we compare it with various analytic predictions .",
    "we proceed by using the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( e.g. , press & schechter 1974 ; bond  1991 ) to construct theoretical mass functions and then convert these to xlfs assuming a form for the x - ray mass - to - light ratio ( c.f . , evrard & henry 1991 ; hereafter eh91 ) .",
    "we begin with the set of cosmological models whose parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "these models form a representative sample of current views as they include open and flat universes spanning a range in @xmath56 . for each model",
    ", the rms density fluctuation on 8@xmath57mpc scales ( @xmath58 ) was determined from the @xmath59 relation of viana & liddle ( 1996 ) which , in turn , was fixed by the local number density of 7 kev clusters .",
    "the hubble constant was chosen to give an age for the universe of roughly 12.5 gyrs ( consistent with globular cluster age determinations ; e.g. , chaboyer et al .",
    "1998 ) . for each model",
    "we list the relative contributions of matter ( @xmath56 ) , baryonic matter ( @xmath60 ) , and the cosmological constant ( @xmath61 ) to the overall energy density .",
    "power spectra for all the models were generated using the code described in klypin & holtzman ( 1997 ) and then ps mass functions ( with @xmath62 ) were computed at @xmath63 .",

    "however , pre - heating of the icm at an early epoch ( possibly by galaxy formation ) results in a different scaling relation and also resolves several discrepancies between theoretical and observational results concerning evolution in the xlf ( e.g. , evrard 1990 , navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) . for the case of a constant entropy core",
    ", eh91 derived a scaling which implies @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the usual ratio of dark matter to gas ` temperatures ' .",

    "the luminosity in our bandpass is then calculated by applying the usual bremmstrahlung correction factor as well as a multiplicative factor to account for the presence of metals ( bryan & norman 1998 ; eqn .",
    "21 ) .    using the relation for @xmath98 and the bandpass correction",
    ", we converted our ps mass functions to differential luminosity functions and made @xmath99-squared fits to a subset of the observational data .",
    "the observational points used in the fits are all four poor cluster points ( bll96 ) , the five highest luminosity abell cluster points and the highest luminosity bcs point from figure 1 .",

    "it is only for @xmath106 that incompleteness due to the optical selection of our sample is apparent .",
    "the observed incompleteness is not a failing in abell s catalog , but rather results from the contribution of poor clusters and groups below abell s richness limit .",
    "combined with the poor - cluster xlf of bll96 , we have examined the local xlf over nearly three orders of magnitude in @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the local xlf is remarkably well represented by a power - law over nearly this entire range in @xmath3 .",

    ", we also performed a schechter - function fit which is in good agreement with other recent surveys to much higher redshift ( @xmath108 ) , confirming a lack of significant evolution at these luminosities .",
    "we have used our new _ local _ xlf to derive a constraint on @xmath22 .",
    "this would appear to contradict a common claim that the @xmath109 dengeneracy can be broken only by including the evolution with redshift ( _ e.g. _ bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , ps mass functions for combinations of @xmath58 and @xmath22 that satisfy a @xmath109 constraint differ in shape .",
    "borgani  ( 1999 ) have recently used the shape of the local xlf in order to constrain @xmath109 and the shape of the l - t relation . including clusters at higher redshift",
    ", they concluded that @xmath110 for open models , and @xmath111 for flat models assuming no evolution in the l - t relation ; both of which are consistent with our results . in this work ,",
    "we have used the shape of the local xlf , the local number density of 7 kev clusters , and the ps formalism in order to constrain the cluster m - l relation ; @xmath112 .",
    "there is a clear trend for @xmath91 to increase with @xmath22 ( see also mathiesen & evrard 1998 )",
    ". none of the theoretical models are consistent with the analytic prediction @xmath92 from kaiser ( 1986 ) . if we adopt the constant core - entropy model of eh91 , and the additional constraint that @xmath113 , the shape of the local xlf suggests that @xmath114 , with no constraint on @xmath23 .",
