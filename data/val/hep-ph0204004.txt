    "recently , brodsky , hwang and schmidt @xcite ( bhs ) have demonstrated the existence of a new leading - twist mechanism for a single - spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) .",
    "this is an important result for two reasons .",
    "first is that a single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) of this kind directly probes the partonic structure associated with chiral - symmetry breaking .",
    "second is the paucity of leading - twist observables in hard - scattering processes with an ssa .",
    "barone , drago and ratcliffe @xcite have recently published a useful review of the subject .    in this letter",
    ", i will explore some important consequences of the results of bhs :    * it is completely consistent with factorization , and provides an existence proof of the sivers asymmetry @xcite , that is , of a transverse - spin - dependent azimuthal asymmetry of the distribution of quarks in a proton . *",
    "although this asymmetry is time - reversal odd , it is nonzero . a proof @xcite that i gave to the contrary must therefore be incorrect .",
    "* hence phenomenology that has been done using the sivers asymmetry @xcite is in fact appropriate in qcd . *",
    "instead the time - reversal argument shows that the asymmetry is reversed in the drell - yan process . *",
    "hence there is an ssa in the drell - yan process .",
    "this is of course of direct importance @xcite to the rhic spin program . *",
    "another time - reversal odd parton distribution is permitted @xcite : this is labeled @xmath1 , and it gives a transversity to quarks taken from an _",
    "un_polarized hadron .",
    "( the transversity is dependent on the transverse momentum of the quark . ) * hence in the drell - yan process , even when both the beam and target are unpolarized , the annihilating quark and antiquark have a transverse - momentum - dependent transversity . as shown by brandenburg , nachtmann and mirkes",
    "@xcite , this gives a characteristic angular dependence for the lepton pair pair , a term proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "such an asymmetry has been observed @xcite experimentally , and its large size has been a phenomenological puzzle .",
    "the only explanation @xcite has been a nonzero @xmath1 parton density , which has previously appeared to be ruled out by time - reversal invariance .",
    "boer @xcite has both fitted the data and discussed its implications for the rhic spin program .",
    "the phenomenology of the various parton densities will of course be rather complicated to sort out @xcite , since in addition to the two mechanisms listed above , there is also the asymmetry @xcite associated with the fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks .",
    "the different mechanisms can be distinguished by their different dependences on the transverse spin of the proton and on the azimuthal direction relative to the outgoing lepton .",
    "in addition to the drell - yan data , there is also data @xcite on the ssa in sidis , which up to now has been only analyzed in terms of the fragmentation effect .",
    "so one knows the effects are quite substantial .",
    "the physics importance of these analyses is that the parton densities involved arise from interference between amplitudes with left- and right - handed polarization states , so that they only exist because of chiral symmetry breaking in ( non - perturbative ) qcd .",
    "they therefore provide new probes of the chiral nature of the partonic structure of hadrons , as well as of the interactions that produce the necessary phases .",
    "bhs performed their calculations in a field - theoretic model in which qcd , with massive quarks , is supplemented by a colored scalar diquark field and an elementary proton field .",
    "independently of whether this model is suitable for describing nonperturbative hadronic physics , it provides an excellent testbed for matters of principle , for example whether an ssa is permitted by the symmetries of qcd .",
    "the quark and proton are massive , so chiral symmetry is broken , just as in qcd .",
    "if the gauge field is abelian , the gluon can be given a mass in the lagrangian without violating renormalizability , and then the calculation can be done without confusion by the effects of actual soft or collinear divergences .",
    "this takes us further from real qcd , but leaves the matters of principle unaffected .    as is well - known",
    ", the existence of an ssa requires a non - trivial phase in the amplitude , and since the initial hadronic state is a single stable particle , the phase is associated with final state interactions . in the lowest - order graphs , fig .",
    "[ fig : ssa.sidis ] and its hermitian conjugate , the ssa therefore arises from the imaginary part of the amplitude , which can be calculated by setting the intermediate quark - diquark state on - shell .        by explicit calculation brodsky , hwang and schmidt @xcite",
    "have shown that there is indeed a leading - twist ssa .",
    "the effect is only large if the transverse momentum of the outgoing particle is low compared with @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise a standard factorization theorem without partonic transverse momentum would be appropriate , and then the ssa would be power suppressed ( of `` twist-3 '' ) .",
    "of course , most of the cross section is at low transverse momentum .",
    "any relevant factorization theorem will involve transverse - momentum - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions , as opposed to the more commonly used integrated distributions .    since the momentum @xmath4 of the exchanged gluon is in a region associated with rescattering , the calculated ssa appears , at first sight , to be in contradiction with the factorization theorem , and its proof . but",
    "a closer examination of a proof of factorization shows that this first impression is false . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite the integration over @xmath4 must be deformed far into the complex plane in order to derive factorization ; the contour is not pinched in the rescattering region .",
    "the quark line may then be replaced by an eikonalized line , which in turn can be obtained from the feynman rules for the wilson line in the gauge - invariant operator definition of the quark number density  see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdf.def ] ) below .",
    "the ssa in the cross section is therefore due to an ssa in the dependence of the parton density on transverse momentum .",
    "because the contour can be deformed , the quark propagator is in fact off - shell by order @xmath5 , and the final - state interactions occur over a short scale in time and distance , the same scale as is associated with the uncertainty in the position of the vertex of the virtual photon .",
    "hence the final - state interactions are definitely _ not _ those associated with hadronization of the quark .",
    "the parton density has the following operator definition @xcite @xmath6 here , light - front coordinates are used : @xmath7 . as usual , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fractional longitudinal momentum and the transverse momentum of the quark , and @xmath10 is the transverse part of the proton s spin vector .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 indicates a wilson - line operator going out from the point @xmath12 to future infinity , and @xmath13 is a variable associated with its direction , as we will now explain .",
    "the form of the eikonal approximation for an outgoing quark determines the future as the correct direction , and suggests that the wilson lines go in the light - like direction given by the vector @xmath14 .",
    "however , as shown by collins and soper @xcite , the use of a light - like direction gives severe divergences associated with integrals over the rapidity of gluons .",
    "it is suitable to cutoff the divergences by choosing a non - light - like direction @xcite , parameterized by the variable @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdf.def ] ) .",
    "solution of the equation @xcite for evolution in @xmath13 gives well - known sudakov effects that broaden the @xmath0 distribution ; meng , olness and soper @xcite have investigated its phenomenology in sidis .",
    "nevertheless this complication does not affect the lowest - order calculation of the ssa .    the parton number density defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdf.def ] ) can be decomposed @xcite into the conventional spin - independent term and a spin - dependence @xmath15 times a special parton density , labeled @xmath16 .",
    "calculations can be readily performed to reproduce the bhs result from the ssa of the parton density defined by eq ,  ( [ eq : pdf.def ] ) .",
    "the factorization theorem to which it is associated is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fact ] , where there are transverse - momentum - dependent quark distribution and fragmentation functions .",
    "this ssa in the quark density is exactly the one proposed by sivers @xcite . now ,",
    "in @xcite i gave a proof that the sivers asymmetry vanishes .",
    "the proof involved applying space- and time - reversal to the quark fields in the operator definition of the parton densities , and the proof fails because it ignored the presence of wilson lines in the operators defining the parton density . under time - reversal",
    "the future - pointing wilson lines are replaced by past - pointing wilson lines , so that the correct version of the proof gives @xmath17 observe the change in sign of the transversity vector .",
    "since , as we will see , the past - pointing wilson lines are appropriate for factorization in the drell - yan process , the correct result is not that the sivers asymmetry vanishes , but that it has opposite signs in dis and in drell - yan : @xmath18    in a sense ,",
    "i have derived the situation suggested by anselmino , barone , drago and murgia @xcite , that non - standard time - reversal properties can enable the sivers asymmetry to exist .",
    "for the elementary parton fields , the standard time - reversal transformation is a symmetry of the lagrangian , and we can not evade its consequences .",
    "but the fields defining the parton densities are non - local : they are the elementary fields multiplied by wilson lines .",
    "perhaps these non - local fields can be related to the chiral quark fields discussed in @xcite .    in the approximation that the wilson lines are along light - like lines ,",
    "the wilson lines in the operator definition of the parton densities can be eliminated by using the light - cone gauge",
    ". however , the gluon propagator then contains singularities of the form @xmath19 .",
    "it follows from the above discussion that the prescription for defining the analytic properties of this singularity must be intimately tied with the derivation of the factorization theorem .",
    "therefore a simple use of standard prescriptions , such as those of refs.@xcite , is likely to be incorrect .",
    "bhs argue that defining the parton densities by the light - cone gauge method immediately relates them to the exclusive light - cone wave functions .",
    "then they argue that since these wave functions are properties of the proton state alone , they can not involve final - state interactions and can not generate the ssa under discussion .",
    "this appears to be in contradiction with the arguments given above .",
    "a resolution of this contradiction is that the light - cone wave functions involve decomposing the proton state with respect to fields on a light - like surface , as opposed to a space - like surface .",
    "the light - like eikonal line from which we obtained the phase giving the ssa effectively gives the infinite - energy limit of the relevant final - state interactions .",
    "so the final - state interactions are occurring on a light - like surface  see fig .",
    "[ fig : space - time ] . final - state interactions can and do occur on a light - like surface , so there need be no contradiction between saying that the ssa in the parton density is given by final - state interactions and that the parton density is obtained from wave - functions of the proton state .",
    "thus i would disagree with the claim `` structure functions are not parton probabilities '' that has been advanced by brodsky et al.@xcite .",
    "this issue deserves further study , of course .",
    "let us now apply the bhs model to the drell - yan process , for which the lowest - order graph giving an ssa is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssa.dy ] .",
    "the requisite imaginary part now comes from an _",
    "initial_-state interaction between an active quark and a spectator diquark .",
    "structure function is of twist 3 . ]",
    "the contour deformation argument continues to apply , except that the deformation is in the opposite direction , away from the initial - state pole , and the wilson line in the operator definition of the parton density is therefore past - pointing . as already explained , this results in a reversed sign of the ssa as compared with sidis .",
    "close examination of the factorization proofs for drell - yan @xcite will indicate that the past - pointing wilson lines do not mesh particularly well with later parts of the factorization proof where cancellation of interactions between the two hadrons is demonstrated .",
    "these parts of the proof prefer future - pointing wilson lines",
    ". however , the proofs were constructed in the particular context of a cross section integrated over transverse momentum , or at large transverse momentum .",
    "thus there is no automatic contradiction with the new results .",
    "however it is necessary to examine carefully how to prove factorization in the case of the transverse - momentum - dependent cross sections .",
    "as regards transverse - momentum distributions , the actual proofs of collins and soper @xcite only apply to @xmath20 annihilation , a process with only final - state interactions .",
    "the failure of the time - reversal argument applies to more than the sivers asymmetry .",
    "there is also the possibility of a nonzero transversity of a quark in an unpolarized hadron , with the transversity being correlated with the transverse momentum of the quark .",
    "this is defined by @xcite @xmath21 in the bhs model , the value of this object ought to be very similar to the previously discussed ssa , since the calculation is quite similar .    among the phenomenological implications of this quark transversity is an important result for the angular distribution of the final - state leptons in the drell - yan process .",
    "since the transversities of the annihilating quark and antiquark are correlated with the transverse momentum of the drell - yan pair , there is a characteristic angular dependence for the leptons , from the spin - dependence of the elementary @xmath22 process .",
    "the angular dependence @xcite is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "now it has long been known that experimental measurements @xcite of the angular distribution of the leptons have a coefficient for this part of the angular dependence that is substantially larger than that predicted by the hard - scattering calculations for drell - yan pairs of _ large _ transverse momentum .",
    "moreover , brandenburg , nachtmann and mirkes @xcite have shown that this large coefficient is explained by a substantial non - zero value for the @xmath1 quark density ; a more recent fit was given by boer @xcite .",
    "the apparent contradiction , that this quark density is prohibited by time - reversal invariance of qcd has now disappeared .",
    "we now see that there are three sources for the ssa and related azimuthal dependences in leading - twist processes :    * the sivers asymmetry @xcite with transversely polarized target . *",
    "the final - state fragmentation asymmetry from a transversely polarized quark , with the quark acquiring its transversity from the initial - state transverse polarization of the target proton .",
    "this includes both the single - particle asymmetry of ref .",
    "@xcite and the two - particle asymmetry of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite * the transversity of a quark in an unpolarized hadron @xcite .    previously , only the fragmentation asymmetries appeared to be permitted by time - reversal invariance .",
    "but now we have seen that the presence of wilson lines in the definition of the parton densities also allows the time - reversal - odd parton densities to be nonzero .",
    "this of course uncovers a rich phenomenology .",
    "luckily a start has made , notably by anselmino and murgia @xcite , by boer @xcite , and by boer and mulders @xcite , who have chosen to follow experimental indications of time - reversal - odd parton densities .",
    "in particular , the measured angular dependence of leptons @xcite in the unpolarized drell - yan process indicates that substantial effects exist .",
    "hence new areas of research are possible at rhic , for example with the drell - yan asymmetry .",
    "comparison of results between dis and drell - yan will be particularly interesting .",
    "a test of the prediction of the reversal of the sign of the sivers asymmetry between the two processes is absolutely vital , since it would validate the whole approach of this paper .    in previous work on factorization ,",
    "the issue of the definition of the wilson lines has appeared to be a technicality .",
    "but now the sign difference between dis and drell - yan provides an experimental probe sensitive to this issue and hence to the time - dependence of the associated microscopic physics .",
    "one complication that it will be essential to treat correctly is the sudakov driven dilution of the asymmetries in transverse - momentum - dependent cross sections as the overall energy and @xmath3 are increased .",
    "the results of all this work will be measurements of parton - level asymmetries that probe the dynamics of chiral - symmetry breaking , and that can therefore connect in an interesting way to theories of hadronic structure .",
    "an earlier account of the phenomenology of the sivers effect than @xcite was given by anselmino , boglione and murgia in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "see @xcite for analyses of the hermes data @xcite .",
    "there are earlier discussions @xcite that include the sivers asymmetry in this context",
    ".    at least one additional related effect can be used in this area : the polarization of a @xmath23 baryon in the fragmentation of an unpolarized quark , as a function of their relative transverse momentum  see ref .",
