    "in the drawing on the left of figure [ fig : chart ] , we give an example of a simple context - free chart , where we have assumed the edges to be conventionally oriented from left to right .    seen in geometric terms , this chart is an oriented planar graph dividing the plane in five internal regions and one external one .",
    "each of the internal regions can be transformed into a disk by a topological transformation of the plane preserving oritentation .",
    "the five corresponding circular graphs , or s , are shown on the right .",
    "relative to one of these cells , an edge can be considered oriented positively if it goes clockwise , or negatively if it goes counter - clockwise .",
    "thus , the np edge of the s - np - vp cell is oriented negatively , while the np edge of the np - john cell is oriented positively .",
    "it is then an obvious observation that the chart on the left can be obtained by a process of `` stitching '' together the five cells along _ identically labelled but inversely oriented _ edges .",
    "in the course of this operation , each cell undergoes an orientation - preserving topological deformation .",
    "the cells of figure [ fig : chart ] provide a geometric presentation of context - free productions .",
    "each cell has the property that it has exactly one positively oriented edge , labelled with a nonterminal , and one or several negatively oriented edges , labelled with nonterminals or terminals .",
    "if , in the context - free chart , one chooses a point in each internal region and draws lines between two points belonging to adjacent regions , then one obtains a planar graph which is tree - like , and which corresponds to the usual notion of derivation tree in a context - free grammar .    if , instead of a context - free grammar , one considers a general type-0 grammar , charts can be generalized to graphs which do not have this `` tree - like '' property .",
    "an illustration of such a case is given in figure [ fig : qsys ] , which shows a derivation of the french prepositional phrase `` du livre '' , involving the contraction `` du '' of the preposition `` de '' with the determiner `` le '' .",
    "the graph on the left could be called a `` type-0 chart '' , or a `` q - system chart '' , in reference to @xcite .",
    "the cells associated with this chart are shown on the right .",
    "in contrast to the context - free case , one of the cells now contains two positively oriented edges .    in the computation systems we are proposing here , we will consider cells with an arbitrary number of positively or negatively oriented edges to be the building blocks from which computations are built .",
    "our formalization will rely on the mathematical concept of a .",
    "cancellation diagrams were introduced in 1933 by van kampen @xcite and have been playing since the seventies an increasing role in combinatorial group theory @xcite .",
    "* definition*. a , or simply , over the vocabulary @xmath0 is a finite graph which is : ( 1 ) planar , that is , embedded in the plane in such a way that two edges can only intersect at a vertex ; ( 2 ) connected ; ( 3 ) directed , that is , the edges carry an orientation ; ( 4 ) labelled , that is , each edge carries a label taken in @xmath0 . in the limit , a graph consisting of a single vertex is also considered to be a diagram .",
    "a diagram separates the plane in @xmath1 connected open sets : the exterior ( set of points that can be connected to a point at infinity without crossing an edge ) , and @xmath2 open internal regions , called s , each consisting of points which can be connected without crossing an edge , but which are separated from the exterior .",
    "the set of points in the plane which belong to an edge or to an internal region of the diagram is called the of the diagram .",
    "the locus of a diagram is always a connected and simply connected ( no holes ) closed region of the plane .",
    "an edge whose points are not in the closure of a cell region is called a edge of the diagram .",
    "an example of a diagram over the vocabulary @xmath3 is given in .",
    "this diagram is made up of three cells and contains one thin edge .",
    "the of a cell is the set of edges which constitute its topological boundary .",
    "the boundary of a diagram is the set of edges which are such that all their points are connected to the exterior .",
    "if one choses an arbitrary vertex ( such as o in the figure ) on the boundary of a diagram , and if one moves on the boundary in a conventional clockwise fashion , then one collects a list of edges which are either directed in the same way as the movement , or contrary to it . by producing a sequence of labels with exponent @xmath4 in the first case , @xmath5 in the second case , one",
    "can then construct a word over the vocabulary ( that is , a word in the _ free group _ over @xmath0 , see below ) ; this word is said to be a of the diagram .",
    "we will say that a diagram is if there does not exist a pair of edges with a common vertex @xmath6 , with the same label , oriented oppositely relative to @xmath6 ( that is , both edges point towards @xmath6 or both point from @xmath6 ) , and such that at least one of the two `` angles '' formed by the two edges is `` free '' , that is , does not `` contain '' another diagram edge ( see ) .",
    "suppose that one is given a fixed set of cells @xmath7 over a vocabulary @xmath0 .",
    "let s consider the following generative process for producing diagrams ( only informally described here ) :    1 .",
    "initialize the diagram by choosing a point @xmath6 in the plane ; 2 .",
    "iterate an arbitrary number of times the following procedure any of the following steps : * add a new oriented labelled edge to the exterior of the current diagram by connecting it to one vertex on the boundary of the diagram ; * add a new cell taken from @xmath7 to the exterior of the current diagram , either by connecting one vertex of the cell to one vertex on the boundary of the diagram or by `` pasting '' the cell to the boundary of the diagram along consecutive edges having the same labels and arrow directions ; * reduce the current diagram by `` folding together '' two adjacent edges on its boundary which have the same label but opposite directions ( informally , the deformation involves gradually reducing the external `` angle '' between the two edges until they are identified , that is , the folding is towards the interior of the diagram ) ;    it is easy to prove that this process generates exactly the set @xmath8 of diagrams @xmath9 over @xmath0 such that all the cells of @xmath9 are elements of @xmath7 .",
    "the boundary words of elements of @xmath8 can be seen as _ coding _ results of the computations determined by the `` specification '' @xmath7 .    for instance , going back to the example of figure [ fig : chart ] , the boundary word @xmath10 is the result of a computation over the specification @xmath7 consisting of the five circular cells in the figure .",
    "any word thus obtained which is of the form @xmath11 can be seen as coding the fact that @xmath12 is a sentence relative to the `` grammar '' specified by @xmath7 .",
    "this informal notion of computation with diagrams will now be made more precise by turning to its algebraic counterpart , _ group computation structures_.",
    "we start by quickly reviewing some basic concepts of group theory before turning to group computation structures .",
    "a @xmath13 is a set @xmath13 together with a product @xmath14 , written @xmath15 , such that :    * this product is associative ; * there is an element @xmath16 ( the neutral element ) with @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",

    "the notion of normal subgroup is central in algebra . for our purposes here ,",
    "the less usual notion of normal submonoid will be the more important notion .",
    "let s consider an arbitrary set @xmath0 , called the , and let s form the so - called set of atoms on @xmath0 , which is notated @xmath31 and is obtained by taking elements @xmath32 in @xmath0 as well as the formal inverses @xmath33 of these elements .",
    "we now consider the set @xmath34 consisting of the empty string , notated @xmath23 , and of strings of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an atom on @xmath0 .",
    "it is assumed that such a string is , that is , never contains two consecutive atoms which are inverse of each other : no substring @xmath37 or @xmath38 is allowed to appear in a reduced string .    when @xmath39 and @xmath40 are two reduced strings , their concatenation @xmath41 can be reduced by eliminating all substrings of the form @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "it can be proven that the reduced string @xmath42 obtained in this way is independent of the order of such eliminations . in this way , a product on @xmath34 is defined , and it is easily shown that @xmath34 becomes a ( non - commutative ) group , called the over @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "a computation can thus be seen as a `` witness '' , or as a `` proof '' , of the fact that a given element of @xmath45 is a result of the computation structure .    for specific computation tasks ,",
    "one focusses on results of a certain sort , for instance results which express a relationship of input - output , where input and output are assumed to belong to certain object types .",
    "for example , in computational linguistics , one is often interested in results which express a relationship between a fixed semantic input and a possible textual output ( generation mode ) , or conversely in results which express a relationship between a fixed textual input and a possible semantic output ( parsing mode ) .",

    "it is often convenient to picture the set of all cyclic permutations of a cyclically reduced word as a circular diagram of labelled oriented edges such that no adjacent edges cancel each other . for any word @xmath59",

    ", it can be assumed that the relators in @xmath44 are cyclically reduced , because the result monoid is invariant when one considers a new set of relators consisting of conjugates of the original ones . from now on , unless stated otherwise , this assumption will be made for all relators considered .",

    "we are now able to state what j. rotman calls `` the fundamental theorem of combinatorial group theory '' @xcite .",
    "we give the theorem in a slightly extended form , adapted to the case of a , that is , using normal _ sub - monoid _ closure rather than normal _ subgroup _ closure ; the subgroup case follows immediately by taking a set or relators containing @xmath66 along with @xmath46 .",

    "the proof is not provided ; it can easily be recovered from the property demonstrated in @xcite ( chapter 5 , section 1 ) .",
    "the proof involves the following remark .",
    "if one considers a product @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 arbitrary elements of , this product can be read as the boundary word of the `` star '' diagram represented in , starting at @xmath6 and progressing clockwise .",

    "the cyclically reduced word @xmath74 is an element of , for it can be obtained by forming the product @xmath75 if we form the star diagram for this product , we obtain the first diagram shown in .",
    "this diagram is not reduced , for instance the two straight edges labelled @xmath55 are offending the reduction condition .",

    "we will now show how the formal concepts introduced above can be applied to the problems of grammatical description and computation .",

    ", we would like to consider the following question : what , if any , is the difference between group computation and these rewriting systems ?",
    "a detailed discussion of this question is outside the scope of this paper ( see @xcite ) , and only some brief indications will be given here .",
    "let s consider a type-0 rewriting system and a type-0 chart @xmath127 relative to this system .",
    "we have seen in section [ grammar and geometry ] that such a chart can be obtained by `` pasting '' together cells corresponding to the rules of the rewriting system .",
    "that is , the chart @xmath128 can be seen as a diagram relative to the defined by this collection of cells .",
    "but such a diagram has an interesting property among all diagrams that could be produced relative to the : the cells of @xmath128 are partially ordered by the relation which considers a cell @xmath129 of a diagram to immediately precede a cell @xmath130 of the same diagram iff there is a common edge between @xmath129 and @xmath130 which is negatively oriented relative to @xmath129 and positively oriented relative to @xmath130 . for a standard presentation of the chart @xmath128 ,",
    "this partial order is just the usual `` top - down '' order between the cells .",
    "the fact that the cells of the diagram @xmath128 are partially - ordered by the precedence relation just defined is a _ global _ property of the diagram which means that the precedence relation does not create cycles among cells .",
    "it is a property which is foreign to group computation , where cells are assembled relative to a purely _ local _ criterion .",
    "this means that , in general , the translation of a type-0 system into a produces diagrams that can not be interpreted as derivations of the original type-0 system .",
    "however , in the case where the relator cells resulting from the translation of the rewriting system can be _ statically _ partially - ordered by the precedence relation where @xmath131 iff @xmath55 has a negatively oriented edge labelled @xmath132 and @xmath55 has a positively oriented edge with the same label @xmath132 , _ then _ no cycles can ever appear in diagrams of the , and then the two notions of computation become identical .    the static condition just described is very restrictive for type-0 systems _ stricto sensu _ , that is , having a finite vocabulary of non - terminals , because it precludes recursivity .",
    "it is , however , much more interesting in the case of rewriting systems defined by rule - schemes over terms , such as dcgs @xcite , or their type-0 counterparts .",
    "an example of such a situation is provided by the cells of figure [ fig : linguistic - cells ] , which can be seen to correspond to an `` extended '' type-0 system of this kind , and where the instanciated relator cells can be partially ordered by the precedence relation just described ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let s first define the _ semantic size _",
    "@xmath133 of a logical form term as the number of nodes in this term which are different from argument identifiers such as , , ... ( thus , @xmath134 ) , and the semantic size of a phonological word as 0 .",
    "let s also define the _ phonological size _",
    "@xmath135 of a phonological word as 1 , and the phonological size of a logical form as 0 .",
    "if one looks at the multi - relator schemes of figure [ fig : g - grammar with multi - relators ] , it can be checked that any grounded multi - conjugate instance @xmath59 of each multi - relator scheme is such that @xmath140 .",

    "0 - \\ss({\\tt n } ) , -1 ) = ( 1,-1),\\ ] ] and so on for the other relator schemes .",
    "consider now a computation of a result @xmath59 involving @xmath2 multi - relators ( in geometric terms , a diagram with boundary @xmath59 involving @xmath2 multi - cells ) .",
    "the value of @xmath143 is then @xmath144 taken @xmath2 times , that is , @xmath145 . this has the following consequences ( stated informally here ) for the complexity of parsing and generation :    1 .   if a phonological string and a logical form are in correspondence relative to the grammar , then it is possible to bound the phonological size of the string as a function of the semantic size of the logical form ( in fact they are equal ) .",
    "if we have a string of phonological size @xmath2 to parse , then any computation will involve at most ( and in fact exactly ) @xmath2 multi - cells ; this implies that parsing is decidable and of bounded complexity .",
    "if we have a logical form of semantic size @xmath2 to generate , then any computation will involve at most ( and in fact exactly ) @xmath2 multi - cells ; this implies that generation is decidable and of bounded complexity .",
    "although the grammar is rather remarkable in admitting a morphism such as @xmath137 which has the same value on all the multi - relators , what is really needed for the complexity properties to hold is a less demanding requirement ( see @xcite ) of finding a morphism which realize some reasonable `` exchange '' of phonological material for semantic material on each multi - relator .",

    "<S> we then relate in section 4 the geometric and the algebraic views of computation by using the fundamental theorem of combinatorial group theory @xcite . in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> we study in more detail the relationship between the two views on the basis of a simple grammar stated as a group computation structure . in section 6 </S>",
    "<S> we extend this grammar to handle non - local constructs such as relative pronouns and quantifiers . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude in section 7 with some brief notes on the differences between normal submonoids and normal subgroups , group computation versus rewriting systems , and the use of group morphisms to study the computational complexity of parsing and generation . </S>"
