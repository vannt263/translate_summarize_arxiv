    "nasbs@xmath0 is a little studied semiconductor that was recently shown to be remarkably effective as a solar absorber material , @xcite and has also been mentioned as a potential thermoelectric material based on computational screening .",
    "@xcite remarkably , an efficiency of 3.18% was obtained in the first report using nasbs@xmath0 nanparticles in a dye sensitized solar cell .",
    "@xcite this is comparable to the efficiency of early cells of similar type made using organometallic halide perovskites .",
    "@xcite those materials have since proven to be a revolutionary advance in photovoltaics , but suffer from issues with long term stability and the fact that they contain pb , which is undesirable .",
    "@xcite nasbs@xmath0 contains only environmentally friendly low cost elements , and this very promising early experimental result , and the theoretical results below suggest that it may as well represent a revolutionary new material for solar photovoltaic applications .    from a valence point of view",
    "one might regard the stoichiometry as derived from pbs by splitting of the divalent pb site into monovalent na and trivalent sb . in this way one might anticipate that nasbs@xmath0 would be a semiconductor and that the band gap may be higher than that of pbs if normal trends are followed due to the splitting of the cation site .",
    "however , at ambient temperature the crystal structure deviates strongly the rocksalt structure of pbs , as discussed below .",
    "more significantly , the presence of na suggests a propensity for defects , e.g. na off - stoichiometry .",
    "good charge collection requires a high carrier drift length , which typically occurs in high quality defect free material , and so the high performance of nasbs@xmath0 as a solar absorber is surprising .",
    "however , several soft lattice solar materials have been discovered , most notably ch@xmath4nh@xmath4pbi@xmath4 , @xcite where defects do not seem to play the same detrimental role as in more traditional materials such as cdte .",
    "@xcite here we report first principles calculations aimed at understanding the properties of this compound , especially in relation to its use as a solar absorber .",
    "the present calculations were performed within density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the electronic structure and optical properties were calculated using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method , @xcite as implemented in the wien2k code .",
    "@xcite the total energy calculations and relaxation of the atomic coordinates was done using the perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "@xcite for this , relativity was treated at a scalar relativistic level for the valence states .",
    "the core states were treated relativistically .",
    "lapw sphere radii of @xmath5=2.2 bohr were used for all elements , along with a planewave sector basis cutoff determined by , @xmath6=9 ( here @xmath5 is the radius of the smallest lapw sphere , i.e. 2.2 bohr , and @xmath7 is the planewave cutoff ) .",
    "local orbitals were added to the basis for the s @xmath8 , na @xmath8 and @xmath2 , and sb @xmath9 semicore states .",
    "spin - orbit was included for the electronic and optical properties .",
    "the band gap is important for these , and accordingly these calculations were done using the modified becke - johnson ( mbj ) potential of tran and blaha .",
    "@xcite this functional gives band gaps in good accord with experiment for a wide variety of simple semiconductors and insulators and also appears to give reliable band shapes and optical properties , although at least in certain semiconductors the band masses are more similar to those obtained in standard density functional calculations than those from many body calculations .",
    "@xcite calculation of the transport function for conductivity was done using the boltztrap code .",
    "@xcite optical properties were calculated based on electric dipole transitions in the independent particle approximation as implemented in the wien2k code . the born effective charges and the dielectric tensor",
    "were calculated using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) with the pbe functional as implemented in the vasp code @xcite ( note that calculation of the dielectric tensor can not be done with the mbj potential , since it is not an energy functional and therefore can not be used to evaluate lattice response ) .",
    "the structure of nasbs@xmath0 has been refined into two different monoclinic groups , @xmath10 ( # 15 ) @xcite and @xmath11 ( # 12 ) .",
    "@xcite in addition there is a report of a triclinic structure @xmath12 ( # 2 ) .",
    "@xcite these are all centrosymmetric structures .",
    "the deviation from a cubic structure was discussed in terms of lone pair activity of sb",
    "we did calculations for the three reported structures , in each case using the lattice parameters from the diffraction experiments , and then relaxing the atomic positions subject to the spacegroup symmetry .",
    "we find that the energy for the @xmath11 structure is 0.127 ev per formula unit ( f.u . ) above the energy of the @xmath12 structure .",
    "the @xmath10 structure is 0.005 ev / f.u .",
    "higher than the @xmath12 structure .",
    "we did further calculations to address the issue of the ground state . specifically , we did full relaxations , including both lattice parameters , angles and internal coordinates . for this purpose",
    "we used the vasp code with three different density functionals , specifically the local density approximation ( lda ) , the pbe gga @xcite and the pbesol gga .",
    "@xcite we further did full relaxations of both the @xmath10 and the @xmath12 structures using vasp with lda , pbe , and pbesol @xcite functionals .",
    "these functionals differ in equilibrium volumes for solids .",
    "generally , at increased volume lattices tend to distort more strongly , as was noted in the case of pbtio@xmath4 , an oxide ferroelectric with a ground state particularly sensitive to volume .",
    "@xcite we find that the lda underestimates the unit cell volume of nasbs@xmath0 , yielding 175 @xmath13 , in comparison with the experimental volume of 192 @xmath13 at 300 k. the pbe functional yields 197 @xmath13 , while pbesol yields 184 @xmath13 .",
    "the lda predicts a monoclinic ground state , while the fully relaxed triclinic structure is @xmath14 2 mev / atom lower in energy for both pbe and pbesol . considering the very small energy , and the limitations of dft calculations",
    "we conclude that the ground state is monoclinic @xmath10 or possibly @xmath12 with an extremely small triclinic distortion from this monoclinic structure .",
    "the other monoclinic structure , @xmath11 , is , however , clearly not a feasible structure .    , showing s as large red spheres , sb as gold and na as blue .",
    "the left panel shows the layering , while the right panel shows a single layer ( note that there are two layers with opposite orientation of the s - sb - s units per cell . )",
    "the short sb - s bonds in the s - sb - s units are shown by pipes . ]",
    "we calculated properties for both the @xmath10 and @xmath12 structures , but find very little difference .",
    "for example , the band gap for the triclinic structure is 1.21 ev compared to 1.22 ev for the monoclinic .",
    "this is not surprising since the two structures are very similar , though not identical .",
    "internal coordinates for the two structures are given in tables [ tab - mono ] and [ tab - tri ] .",
    "as seen , the bond valences @xcite are close to their nominal values indicative of an ionic structure , na@xmath15sb@xmath16s@xmath17 , although the sb value of 2.85 is slightly smaller perhaps indicative of some degree of covalency .",
    ".calculated atomic positions and bond valence sums for monoclinic nasbs@xmath0 , spacegroup 15 , @xmath10 , @xmath18=8.232  , @xmath19=6.836  , @xmath20=8.252  , @xmath21=55.72@xmath22 .",
    "these lattice vectors are from experiment .",
    "\" denotes the bond - valence sum .",
    "the fractional atomic coordinates are in terms of the lattice vectors and were determined with the pbe functional . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - mono - dielectric ]    therefore nasbs@xmath0 has enhanced born effective charges due to the cross gap hybridization , similar to several materials that have been found to have excellent charge collection in the context of radiation detection , e.g. tlbr , bii@xmath4 and tl@xmath23sei@xmath24 .",
    "@xcite this enhanced born charge leads to an enhanced dielectric constant , which means enhanced screening .",
    "this provides an explanation of how a material that presumably contains high concentrations of point defects can nonetheless have efficient carrier collection in an optoelectronic application . in this regard",
    ", we note that srtio@xmath4 , which is near a ferroelectric transition , and consequently has a very high dielectric constant at low temperature , also has an exceptional electron mobility that exceeds 30,000 @xmath25/vs in high quality films .",
    "we report first principles calculations for nasbs@xmath26 . we find that the ground state structure is monoclinic @xmath272/@xmath20 or possibly triclinic @xmath12 with a very small triclinic distortion .",
    "we find highly anisotropic electronic and optical properties as may be expected based on the crystal structure .",
    "the results show a quasidirect band gap , with an indirect gap slightly lower than the direct gap , which may impede carrier recombination .",
    "the calculated value of the band gap using the mbj potential is 1.22 ev .",
    "importantly , the electronic structure shows a substantial cross gap hybridization between s @xmath2 and sb @xmath2 states .",
    "this results in enhanced born effective charges and a high dielectric constant .",
    "this high dielectric constant provides screening and defect tolerance for the carrier collection .",
    "therefore it is likely that nasbs@xmath0 can be a useful optoelectronic material , not only as a solar absorber , but also in applications requiring doping .",
