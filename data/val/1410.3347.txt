    "various astrophysical and cosmological observations have confirmed that the main component of the matter in the universe is non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "there is a class of attractive dm candidates called weakly interacting massive particles with masses of @xmath2  gev .",
    "their annihilations in regions with high dm densities can effectively generate energetic cosmic rays , such as gamma - rays , neutrinos , and antimatter particles , which could be captured by dm indirect detection experiments . compared with charged particles , gamma - rays",
    "are less affected by the interstellar matter and the galactic magnetic field during their propagation .",
    "thus their energy spectra and directions as well as their origins can be well determined .",
    "therefore , gamma - rays could be a very good probe to reveal the microscopic properties of dm particles in the galaxy .",
    "recently , several groups reported an extended gamma - ray excess with a high significance peaking at a few gev in the fermi large area telescope data  @xcite .",
    "this excess emission is found in the galactic center ( gc ) and even a larger region up to @xmath3 from the gc after subtracting well - known astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "the spatial distribution of the excess is similar to the square of the navarro - frenk - white dm distribution  @xcite .",
    "a study showed that such an excess is not contributed by emissions from the fermi bubbles  @xcite .",
    "however , it might arise from other astrophysical sources , such as a population of millisecond pulsars @xcite or high energy cosmic rays from the explosion in the gc @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , whether these astrophysical sources can simultaneously interpret the total flux , energy spectrum , and spatial distribution of the excess is still debatable  @xcite .",
    "an attractive and economic explanation for the gamma - ray excess is dm annihilations , if only the dm distribution is a steep navarro - frenk - white profile @xmath4 with an inner slope @xmath5 .",
    "dm particles may directly annihilate into @xmath6 quarks , light quarks , charged leptons  @xcite , or some new light particles  @xcite , which further produce photons from their cascade decays and/or final state radiations .",
    "for instance , the gamma - ray excess can be interpreted by a model with dm particles annihilating into @xmath7 with a mass of @xmath8  gev and a cross section of @xmath9  @xcite , which can naturally yield the correct dm relic density .",
    "if dm particles dominantly couple to @xmath6 quarks at the tree level , they would generate nuclear recoil signatures via loop effects for dm direct detection experiments , which are very sensitive to @xmath10 gev dm particles  @xcite .",
    "future underground experiments , such as xenon and lux , will test these scenarios .",
    "dm annihilations into @xmath6 quarks in the galaxy will also produce extra antiprotons .",
    "considering the pamela antiproton measurement with null excess  @xcite , some works have found stringent constraints on such dm models accounting for the gamma - ray excess  @xcite . nonetheless , it is necessary to point out that these constraints are subject to unavoidable astrophysical uncertainties from cosmic - ray propagation and solar modulation models .",
    "as well known , collider searches for dark matter are complimentary to the direct and indirect detection experiments . at high energy colliders",
    ", dm particle productions can yield events with a significant large missing transverse energy ( @xmath11 ) . in order to explain the gamma - ray excess , models with an appropriate mediator",
    "are favored .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the required dm particle mass and annihilation cross section indicate that the mediator connecting dm and sm particles should be around @xmath12  gev or so , which seems within the searching capability of the lhc .",
    "thus it is hopeful to observe direct productions of the mediators at the lhc . for recent works on this topic",
    ", interested readers can refer the papers @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus on a class of simplified tau portal dm models where dm particles preferentially couples to tau leptons .",
    "the @xmath13  tev leptophilic dm particles have been extensively studied to interpret the anomalous high energy cosmic - ray positrons and electrons .",
    "some recent works have investigated the collider phenomenology of general leptophilic dm models with masses of @xmath12 gev @xcite . for a pure dm annihilation channel to @xmath14 ,",
    "the gamma - ray excess can be explained by the dm particle with a mass of @xmath15 gev and an annihilation cross section of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "compared with the @xmath10  gev dm candidates dominantly interacting with @xmath17 and/or light quarks , the @xmath18  gev leptophilic dm candidates could avoid the stringent constraints from the direct detection due to the loop - suppressed couplings to quarks  @xcite and the experimental threshold . meanwhile , when compared with the leptophilic dm candidates dominantly interacting with @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 , the tau portal dm candidates would circumvent the constraints from the gev cosmic - ray @xmath21 measurements due to the softer @xmath21 spectrum from tau decays , which is usually hidden by the sizable solar modulation effect  @xcite .    according to traditional wisdom",
    ", it may pose a challenge to detect the tau portal dm particles at colliders for their vanishing couplings to the beam particles .",
    "instead , we investigate the mediator productions in the tau portal dm models .",
    "the expected dm annihilation cross section to account for the gamma - ray excess require that the mediators connecting dm particles to taus are moderate heavy , saying several hundred gev or lighter .",
    "these mediators are tau partners carrying the same electric and hyper charges and can be directly pair - produced via the drell - yan process .",
    "the final states of the signals could be @xmath22 plus a large missing transverse energy @xmath11 .",
    "therefore it is well motivated to study the sensitivity to the signatures of these models at the lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly introduce the simplified models containing dm particles and mediators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dd ] , we study the dm - nucleon scattering and derive the limits from the direct detection . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] , we investigate the phenomenology of these tau portal models at the lhc .",
    "the sensitivity to these models is obtained with @xmath23  tev and integrated luminosities of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "[ sec : concl ] gives our conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe a class of simplified models in which only the tau lepton communicates with the dark sector .",
    "the dark sector contains two particles , which are both required to be odd in a @xmath26 symmetry .",
    "under such a symmetry , the tau lepton is assigned to be even .",
    "consequently , the lighter particle in the dark sector , denoted as @xmath27 , will be stable and become a dm candidate .",
    "the heavier particle is a mediator connecting the dm particle to the tau lepton .",
    "here we consider a few models in two cases : the case that the dm particle is a fermion with a spin 1/2 and the case that it is a scalar with a spin 0 . in all these models",
    ", a pair of dm particles can annihilate into @xmath22 via the @xmath28-channel exchange of the mediator . for simplicity , we neglect those models involving dm particles with higher spins .    for the fermionic dm particle case , we consider two models , the dirac and majorana fermionic dark matter ( dfdm and mfdm ) , respectively . in these models ,",
    "the mediator is assumed to be a scalar @xmath29 and the dark sector interacts with the right - handed tau via a renormalizable yukawa - type interaction @xmath30 as @xmath27 is a singlet , @xmath29 should carry a hyper charge @xmath31 and hence an electric charge @xmath31 , and a tau lepton number @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath29 interacts with photons and @xmath33 bosons . in supersymmetric models , this mediator @xmath29 corresponds to the right - handed stau .    for the scalar dm particle case",
    ", we consider other two models , namely the complex and real scalar dark matter ( csdm and rsdm ) , respectively .",
    "the mediator is assumed to be a fermion @xmath34 and the renormalizable interaction between the dark sector and the right - handed tau is assumed to be @xmath35 here the mediator @xmath34 carries a hyper charge @xmath31 , an electric charge @xmath31 , and a tau lepton number @xmath32 .    for the sake of simplicity , we will not assume the left - handed tau as a portal particle .",
    "constructing a model with mediators in @xmath36 doublets will have to introduce more degrees of freedom and make the current study more complicated .",
    "interested readers can see ref .",
    "@xcite for the phenomenology of the neutralino dm with a mass of @xmath37 gev and light staus .",
    "in addition , we will not assume that there are other light mediators connecting the dm to the electron or the muon .",
    "if such particles exist in a low energy scale , they would lead to contributions to the electron or muon magnetic dipole moments and lepton flavor violation decays .",
    "studies on this topic can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the following study",
    ", we adopt the dm particle mass and the annihilation cross section to @xmath22 as @xmath38 which can fit the gc gamma - ray excess  @xcite . in the low - velocity limit , the thermally",
    "averaged annihilation cross sections for @xmath39 in the tau portal models are given as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and the approximations are obtained under the condition @xmath42 . for non - self - conjugate dark matter , the factors of @xmath43 in eqs .   and are introduced to compensate the difference from self - conjugate dark matter , so that these quantities can be directly connected to eq .  .",
    "for the mfdm , csdm , and rsdm , the @xmath44-wave annihilation cross sections are proportional to @xmath45 . as we can see from the approximations , to achieve the fixed cross section under the assumption of perturbation , the mediators are required to be light , saying @xmath12 gev or so",
    ". obviously , such light mediators are hopefully accessible in collider searches .",
    "the parameter spaces in the models consistent with the annihilation cross section   within @xmath46 uncertainty are denoted by green bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : constr ] .",
    "in these models , although dm particles do not directly couple to quarks and gluons , they can couple to nuclei through loop - induced electromagnetic form factors .",
    "this may lead to direct detection signals . in the dfdm , mfdm , and csdm models , dm particles scatter off nuclei via exchanging a photon at 1-loop level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd_dphi_dd ] .",
    "but , for the mfdm , the leading interaction corresponds to an anapole moment operator , which leads to a cross section inaccessible in current direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the leading interaction between the rsdm and nuclei arises from 2-loop diagrams via exchanging two photons , and make it more difficult for direct searches  @xcite .    despite these difficulties , limits from recent spin - independent direct detection experiments , such as lux  @xcite , may put some constraints on the dfdm and csdm models .",
    "below we address these constraints .",
    "propagator with the @xmath34 propagator . ]    for the dfdm , the averaged dm - nucleon spin - independent scattering cross section can be approximately expressed as  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dm - nucleon reduced mass , and @xmath49 ( @xmath33 ) is the mass ( atomic ) number of the nucleus , and @xmath50\\ ] ] is the form factor matched to the dm - photon effective operator @xmath51f_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] .    for the csdm",

    "the lux experiment has excluded @xmath56 at 90% c.l .",
    "we use this bound to constrain the parameter spaces of the dfdm and csdm models , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : constr : dfdm ] and  [ fig : constr : csdm ] . for the csdm",
    ", the region consistent with the gc gamma - ray excess has been already excluded . for the dfdm ,",
    "the lux search has also excluded a piece of the green band for @xmath57 , and the remaining could be easily covered by a near future search with larger exposure .",
    "it should be noticed that current direct searches can not constrain the mfdm and rsdm models .",
    "at @xmath58 colliders , the @xmath59 production signatures for the dfdm and mfdm are essentially identical to the signature of right - handed stau pair production in supersymmetric models .",
    "therefore , the bound on the right - handed stau from the lep searches up to @xmath60  @xcite can be applied to our cases .",
    "this has excluded @xmath61 .",
    "as the @xmath62 production rate in @xmath58 collisions are higher than the @xmath59 production rate by an order of magnitude , we expect the lep searches could exclude @xmath63 for the csdm and rsdm .",
    "we display these bounds in fig .",
    "[ fig : constr ] .    as the mediators @xmath29 and @xmath34 carry hyper and electric charges , they can also be produced in pairs at the lhc via drell - yan processes , i.e. , exchanging an @xmath44-channel @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to explore whether current and future lhc runs can directly discover these mediators or not .",
    "the pair production cross sections for @xmath65 with collision energies of 8  tev and 14  tev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] .",
    "it is observed that for @xmath66 , the cross sections of @xmath62 are roughly an order of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath59 due to the reason that there are more helicity states for @xmath34 and the @xmath67 production suffers a kinematic suppression in the angular distribution .     at the 8  tev and 14  tev lhc are shown . ]    once produced , a mediator @xmath29 or @xmath34 is assumed to be 100% decay into a tau and a dm particle .",
    "taus can leptonically decay into @xmath68 and @xmath69 with branching ratios of 17.9% and 17.4% , respectively , and hadronically decay into the remaining modes with a branching ratio of 64.7% . the jets induced by hadronically decaying taus can be identified by the @xmath70-tagging technique at the lhc .",
    "meanwhile , dm particles as well as neutrinos from tau decays will give rise to a missing transverse energy .",
    "consequently , searches for the produced mediators can be classified into three channels : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) denotes a hadronically ( leptonically ) decaying tau .",
    "we generate background and signal simulation samples using ` madgraph  5 `  @xcite , to which the tau portal dm models is added through ` feynrules  2 `  @xcite . ` pythia  6 `  @xcite is utilized to deal with parton shower and hadronization processes , as well as decay processes except for tau decays , which is particularly performed by ` tauola `  @xcite .",
    "the mlm matching scheme  @xcite is adopted to avoid the double counting issue .",
    "we use ` delphes  3 `  @xcite to carry out a parametrized fast detector simulation . for the detector simulation at the 14  tev lhc",
    ", we adopt a set of parameters corresponding to the atlas detector .    at the lhc ,",
    "the mediator productions are analogous to some electroweak productions of supersymmetric particles , for instance , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 productions , which also have similar final states .",
    "such processes have been explored by recent experimental analyses , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , using the 8  tev lhc data with an integrated luminosity of @xmath79 . based on our simulation",
    ", we have reinterpreted these experimental results , and have found that they have yielded no meaningful constraints on the tau portal dm models .",
    "below , we discuss searches for the mediators at the 14  tev lhc .",
    "the @xmath71 searching channel significantly relies on the @xmath70-tagging technique . according to the recent performance of the atlas detector at 8  tev  @xcite , two independent methods , boosted",
    "decision trees and projective likelihood , give similar efficiencies for the discrimination of hadronically decaying taus .",
    "for the medium ( tight ) @xmath70-tagging , the identification efficiency is roughly 60% ( 40% ) , while the faking rate of qcd jets is about 5% ( 2% ) .",
    "although the medium @xmath70-tagging identifies more genuine taus , its sizable faking rate would make it difficult to control the enormous backgrounds with qcd jets .",
    "for this reason , we assume an identification efficiency of 40% and a faking rate of 2% in the simulation for the 14  tev lhc .    for searching the signals of a pair of massive particles which both decay into a visible object and an invisible object , the `` stransverse '' mass @xmath80  @xcite has been found to be a useful variable to discriminate signals from backgrounds .",
