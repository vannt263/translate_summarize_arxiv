    "the well depth , d , can be defined as @xmath5 , with mass of the particle @xmath6 and angular frequency @xmath7 of the harmonic oscillator , so that , in the limiting case @xmath8(or @xmath9 , but keeping the product @xmath10 finite , the mpt potential energy reduces to the harmonic potential energy , @xmath11 . solving the schrdinger equation , the energy eigenvalues for the mpt potential",

    "it is shown that , motion of a particle inside a such high - frequency trap can be treated by averaging over the fast motion ( part of the particle displacement that its frequency is the same as frequency of trap fields ) . in this approach a confined particle in",

    "however , in the realistic experimental setup , the dimension of the trap is finite and the realistic trapping potential is not a harmonic oscillator potential extending to infinity but the truncated and modified one within the extension of the trap .",
    "thus , the realistic confining potential becomes flat near the edge of the trap and can be simulated by the tanh - shaped potential , so that in one dimension ( @xmath4-direction ) can be written as @xmath47 . in this paper",
    ", we try to investigate some effects which originate from finite range property of the trap .",
    "+ according to the previous section , we model this trapped ion as an @xmath0-deformed quantum oscillator .",
    "therefore , the oscillator - like hamiltonian of this system can be written as @xmath48 where we interpret the operator @xmath49 as the operator whose action causes the transition of the ion center - of - mass motion to the lower ( upper ) energy state of the trap .",
