    "understanding the motion of charge carriers in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg antiferromagnet ( afm ) is a central challenge for deciphering the mechanism behind high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates.@xcite at half - filling , the strong hybridization @xmath0 between copper @xmath1 and oxygen @xmath2 orbitals drives the cuo@xmath3 planes into an insulating state in which the holes on neighboring copper atoms align their spins antiferromagnetically in order to gain the superexchange energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the charge transfer energy from @xmath6 to @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "superconductivity emerges upon doping the 2d afm planes with charge carriers.@xcite    a major setback in the search for an analytic description of the behavior of these charge carriers is the lack of a simple wave function for the ground state of the undoped afm planes .",
    "the semi - classical nel state breaks spin rotation symmetry and is therefore smeared out by quantum spin fluctuations to a significant degree that is hard to capture with simple wave functions .",
    "this leaves numerical calculations as the only way to make quantitative predictions.@xcite while implementing such numerical calculations is already a complicated task even for a clean system , a further complication comes from the presence of disorder and imperfections in the real materials , introduced during the sample growth and preparation .",
    "given the low dimensionality , even weak disorder may have dramatic effects on the motion of charge carriers in the cuo@xmath3 planes .",
    "it is well known that non - magnetic impurities are strong pair breakers in @xmath6-wave superconductors.@xcite indeed , substitution of only a few percent of the copper atoms with non - magnetic impurities has been observed to suppress the superconductivity by localizing the low - energy electronic states.@xcite even in the cleanest samples , the dopant ions are in close proximity to the cuo@xmath3 planes , and the disorder potential they create can disturb the motion of the charge carriers .",
    "impurities have been shown to be responsible for a range of phenomena in low - dimensional correlated electron systems , and they can be also utilized for probing correlations which are otherwise difficult to observe in the ground state.@xcite for the undoped parent compound , mean - field analysis of the disordered hubbard model predicts the emergence of an inhomogeneous metallic phase in which the mott gap is locally closed wherever the disorder is strong enough to do so.@xcite however , it is not always the case that impurities destroy the order in the underlying system .",
    "for instance , impurities induce local magnetic order in one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum magnets,@xcite and long - range antiferromagnetism is predicted upon doping some quantum spin liquids with nonmagnetic impurities.@xcite in any event , a complete understanding of the interplay between disorder and afm correlations and especially of their role in controlling the carrier dynamics away from half - filling is still lacking .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a much simpler variant of this problem where , at zero temperature , a hole is created in a 2d ising afm on a square lattice , and is also subject to the on - site attractive potential of an impurity that can be visited by the hole .",
    "thus , our model is very different from previous models of an impurity in a 2d heisenberg afm , which assumed that the hole can not visit the impurity site , and is coupled to it at most through exchange.@xcite as we discuss in the following , our results have some similarities but also considerable differences from those obtained numerically in these other models .",
    "we investigate the local density of states ( ldos ) near the impurity to study the appearance of bound states , focusing specifically on the relevance of the magnetic sublattice on which the impurity is located .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that the wave function of the undoped 2d afm is the simple nel state , and this allows us to study the problem ( quasi)analytically . of course",
    ", spin fluctuations are completely absent , but , as we argue in our discussion , our results allow us to speculate about ( at least some of ) their likely effects .",
    "we note that a single hole in an ising afm was initially believed to be localized even in the absence of impurities , because when the hole hops it reshuffles the spins along its path , thus creating a string of wrongly oriented spins . in dimensions larger than one ,",
    "the energy cost of this string increases roughly linearly with its length , resulting in an effective potential well that binds the hole in the vicinity of its original position .",
    "finite mobility was believed to arise only due to spin fluctuations which can remove pairs of such defects,@xcite but they are absent from the ising hamiltonian .    however , as pointed out by trugman,@xcite the hole is actually delocalized even in the ising afm , and it achieves this by going twice around closed loops .",
    "the string of misaligned spins that are created in the first round is removed when spins are reshuffled again during the second round .",
    "when the last one is removed , the hole ends up at a different site from where it started , and by repeating this process it can move anywhere on its original sublattice ( spin conservation ensures that the hole propagates on one sublattice ) .",
    "this raises the question of how the hole s motion will be affected by an attractive impurity , especially by one located on the other sublattice than the one on which the hole resides . while one expects the hole to become bound to the impurity",
    "if they are on the same sublattice , if they are on different sublattices , one may expect the hole not to be sensitive to the presence of the impurity and therefore remain unbound .",
    "we investigate this problem using a variational method introduced in ref . to study the clean case , which we generalize here to systems that are not invariant under translations .",
    "our results confirm the expected existence of a bound state when the hole and impurity are on the same sublattice .",
    "when they are on different sublattices , we find that the naive picture described above is wrong : the hole develops multiple bound states with a characteristic spectrum and symmetries .",
    "the implications of these results as seen in the wider context of the effect of disorder on dressed quasi - particles are also discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the generalization of the variational method to inhomogeneous systems is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : clean ] , followed in sec .",
    "[ sec : disordered ] by results for a single impurity located ( i ) on the same , and ( ii ) on the other sublattice than the hole .",
    "we conclude the paper by giving a summary and discussing possible further developments of this work in sec . [",
    "sec : symmary ] .",
    "we consider the motion of a single hole doped into a spin-@xmath8 ising antiferromagnet on a 2d square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the undoped system is @xmath9= \\mathrm{\\bar{j}}\\sum_{<i , j>}[\\sigma_i^z\\sigma_j^z+1],\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the pauli matrix and @xmath11 .",
    "the vacuum @xmath12 is the nel - ordered state , with all spins on one sublattice pointing up and those on the other sublattice pointing down .",
    "excitations are gapped spin - flips , or localized magnons , and we refer to them also as spin defects .",
    "the creation operator for a spin defect is written in terms of the spin raising and lowering operators , @xmath13 : @xmath14    consider now the doped case . creating a hole in this system corresponds to removing a spin from the same lattice site , therefore the hole creation operators are : @xmath15 once the hole is created ( @xmath16 ) , it moves via nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "this , however , either creates a spin defect on the hole s departure site ( @xmath17 ) or annihilates one from its arrival site ( @xmath18 ) , if there was a spin defect already there .",
    "the hamiltonian can therefore be written as:@xcite @xmath19\\ } { \\cal{p}}+{\\cal{h}}_\\mathrm{afm}-uh^{\\dagger}_0h_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the projection operator enforcing no double occupancy : at any site there is a hole or there is a spin which is either properly oriented or is flipped , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the first term describes the hopping of the hole which is accompanied by either spin defect creation or annihilation .",
    "in addition , there is an attractive potential of strength @xmath22 centered at the origin @xmath23 , which changes the on - site energy of the visiting hole ( variations of the local hoppings and exchanges can be trivially included in the model and our solution , but should not lead to any qualitative changes if they are small or moderate in size ) .",
    "physically , such a potential can be due to an attractive non - magnetic impurity located above the origin , in a different layer , and which modulates the on - site energy at the origin .",
    "another possibility comes from replacing the atom at the origin by an impurity atom with the same valence , but whose orbitals lie at lower energies than those of the background atoms .",
    "this is very different from the impurity models studied in previous work where the impurity is an inert site that can not be visited by carriers , @xcite and there is at most exchange between the spin of the impurity and that of carriers located on neighboring sites.@xcite",
    "in this section , we construct the equations of motion for the zero - temperature green s function ( gf ) of a single hole moving through the lattice in the absence of impurity , @xmath24 .",
    "this was done using a momentum - space formulation in ref . . here ,",
    "we present a real - space derivation , whose use becomes inevitable once we introduce the impurity which breaks the translational invariance .",
    "the single hole gf is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the resolvent associated with the hamiltonian when @xmath24 .    by dividing the hamiltonian as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the first term in eq .",

    "we do not write explicitly the dependence on @xmath40 of all these gfs .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath41 can be similarly generated . upon application of the dyson identity",
    ", the hole can hop back to @xmath39 and remove the spin defect , or it can hop further away and create a second spin defect , with an associated gf @xmath42 , and so on . as discussed , states with many spins defects are less likely to occur due to the energy cost of creating the spin defects . in order to avoid the rise in the number of spin defects , the hole can trace back its path to remove the spin defects , however this effectively confines the hole to the vicinity of its creation site .",
    "the hole is freed to move on the lattice by the so - called _ trugman _ loop processes in which it goes twice around a closed path . in this case ,",
    "spin defects that are created at the first pass are annihilated when the hole arrives there the second time .",
    "furthermore , when the very last spin defect is annihilated , the hole ends up two hops away from its starting point , which is equivalent to either second- or third - nearest - neighbor hopping on the main lattice ( i.e. , first- or second - nearest - neighbor hopping on the hole s sublattice ) .",
    "longer loops involve more costly intermediate states with more spin defects , therefore we can proceed within a variational approach in which a limit is set for the maximum number of spin defects that can be generated as the hole propagates .",
    "we choose to work with up to three spin - defects , which is the minimum number necessary for the hole to complete the shortest possible loop .",
    "moreover , we only keep spin defect configurations consistent with these short closed loops ( i.e. , we exclude , for example , configurations where all three spin defects are collinear ) .",
    "figure [ hoping1 ] shows how both types of effective hoppings can be generated with the three spin defects types of configurations that we keep in our variational calculation .",
    "one can include more configurations with numerical simulations , but this was shown to results in only quantitative differences as long as @xmath43 is not too large.@xcite    coming back to the equation of motion for @xmath41 , it relates it to @xmath29 and also to three gss @xmath42 with two spin defects .",
    "one of these , with the two spin defects collinear with the hole , can not lead to a closed loop without generating more than three spin defects , therefore we exclude it from the variational space , as discussed .",

    "equation ( [ grg ] ) shows that the motion of the hole is similar to that of a quasiparticle with effective second- and third - nearest - neighbor hoppings @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , and an effective on - site energy @xmath69 .",
    "this quasiparticle is comprised of the hole accompanied by a cloud of spin defects which are constantly created and annihilated , helping to release the quasiparticle to move freely on the lattice .",

    "therefore , the quasiparticle propagates on the sublattice on which the hole is originally introduced , and for which @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the first- and second - nearest - neighbor vectors , respectively .",
    "the constraint that keeps the quasiparticle moving on one sublattice is very general , being due to the spin - conserving nature of the hamiltonian which prevents the hole from ending up on the other sublattice in the absence of spin defects : if the hole starts on one sublattice and ends up on the other one , the @xmath75 component of the total spin angular momentum of the system changes from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , therefore there needs to be an odd number of spin defects around to compensate for the change of spin @xmath78 .    before presenting the real - space solution of eq .",

    "the smaller binding energy at strong hopping is due to the reduction in the quasiparticle s effective mass , which makes it harder to trap .",
    "when the quasiparticle and the impurity are on different sublattices , the enhancement of @xmath174 at small @xmath176 dominates over the effective mass decrease , explaining the growth of the binding energy here . ]    perturbation theory to zero order in @xmath176 suggests that there should be a finite threshold for @xmath22 in order for bound states to appear .",
    "it can be estimated by comparing the hole s energy at any other site in the lattice , @xmath177 , to its minimum energy at the impurity site , @xmath178 ( the increased energy is due to the presence of at least one spin defect ) . if @xmath179 , this implies that it should not be energetically favorable for the hole to be at the impurity site . including @xmath180 corrections",
    "does not change this : a finite threshold value is still predicted .",
    "however , we do not see any such threshold in the full calculation .",
    "this emphasizes again the importance of the ( higher - order ) loop processes in describing the actual behavior .    as noted ,",
    "a total of three bound states emerge upon increasing the impurity attraction @xmath22 .",
    "further increase of @xmath22 increases their binding energy , but it does not give rise to more bound states .",
    "one can identify the nature of these bound states by comparing their amplitudes on the four neighboring sites of the impurity , @xmath181 .",
    "these are extracted from @xmath182 , just as we did in eq .",
    "( [ g - psi ] ) . for the lower peak",
    ", we find the same value of @xmath183-wave symmetry . a state with @xmath184-wave symmetry",

    ", this state has @xmath6-wave symmetry .",
    "the middle state has @xmath186 symmetry : @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "it has a degenerate twin bound state with @xmath189 symmetry , which has zero amplitude at @xmath166 and therefore it does not appear in @xmath190 . since the full lattice has rotational symmetry about the impurity , the resulting bound states are expected to mirror this symmetry as well . the spatial profile of @xmath184- and @xmath6-wave states is presented in fig .",
    "[ decay - dif ] .",
    "it shows that they have very similar decay lengths , consistent with their fairly similar binding energies and with the fact that their corresponding peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] have similar quasi - particle weights .",
    "the @xmath186 state , however , is expected to have about twice larger weight as it is divided between only the @xmath168 and @xmath191 lobes , whereas the @xmath184 and @xmath6 states have weights equally distributed in all four directions . again , this is consistent with its spectral weight shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .     and either of the @xmath184 or @xmath6 states , for a fixed @xmath22 .",

    "[ e_b ] shows the hole s binding energy @xmath192 for the @xmath184-states as a function of the hopping @xmath176 , when @xmath193 .",
    "it exhibits quite different trends in the two cases .",
    "as the hopping becomes stronger , the kinetic energy of the quasiparticle is increased ( its effective mass decreases ) .",
    "a lighter quasiparticle is harder to trap and this explains why its binding energy at fixed @xmath22 gets weaker when it is on the same sublattice with the impurity ( top panel ) .",
    "when the quasiparticle is on the other sublattice ( bottom panel ) it interacts with the impurity by virtue of @xmath174 which is dynamically generated and therefore strongly depends on @xmath176 . at @xmath194 , the hole is locked at a lattice site and is unaware of the presence of impurity , therefore @xmath195 .",
    "as @xmath176 is increased , @xmath174 is enhanced as the hole is able to visit the impurity , whereas the quasiparticle s effective mass is reduced as it gains more kinetic energy .",
    "the former tends to increase the binding energy while the latter reduces it , and it is their competition that sets the dependence of binding energy on hopping .",
    "the initial growth of @xmath192 implies that the enhancement of @xmath174 dominates over the reduction of effective mass at small @xmath176 .",
    "however , since @xmath174 is weaker than @xmath22 for all @xmath176 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , further increase of the hopping makes the hole too light to be easily trapped by @xmath174 and the binding energy eventually starts to decrease . while only the binding energy of the @xmath184-wave state is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ e_b ] , all three peaks exist for small @xmath176 , although they are energetically very close to each other . with increasing @xmath176 they move closer to and eventually merge into the continuum such that , at the highest @xmath176 considered in fig .",
    "[ e_b ] , the @xmath184-wave state is the only existing bound state .",
    "the energy gaps between the three bound states ( when all are present ) are nearly identical .",
    "figure [ gap ] shows its evolution with @xmath176 at a fixed value @xmath193 .",
    "since this must be due to differences in the rotational kinetic energy , it is expected to increase with @xmath176 , as the quasiparticle s effective mass decreases .",
    "this is indeed the observed behavior .",
    "we investigated the effect of a non - magnetic impurity on the motion of a hole in a 2d square ising afm .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle , which propagates on one sublattice , is confirmed to form bound states around the impurity .",
    "this is true both when the hole and impurity are on the same sublattice and when they are on different ones .",
    "the latter occurs because of the renormalization of the effective on - site energy which results in finite effective attraction at the sites next to the impurity that can be visited by the quasiparticle .",
    "this also explains why a total of ( up to ) three bound states with @xmath184 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 symmetries were found in this case , as opposed to only one @xmath184-wave state in the case when the quasiparticle is on the same sublattice with the impurity . in this latter case ,",
    "the impurity is located in the node of @xmath7 and @xmath6 symmetry states , therefore such states do not see it and can not be bound to it .",
    "( in reality , a non - zero @xmath196 arises at sites different from those occupied by the impurity , but given the longer distance to the impurity site , this is not large enough to bind new states ) .    bound states with @xmath184 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 symmetries have also been observed near an inert vacancy in a heisenberg afm . however , in that case , it is the distortion of the magnetic environment around the vacancy that binds the hole.@xcite such a distortion is only possible in a heisenberg model and comes from a local modification of the spin fluctuations . in an ising afm , an inert site would have no effect on the afm order of the other sites . moreover ,",
    "if the hole is not allowed to visit this inert impurity site , there are no trugman loops including it so the hole loses kinetic energy when located in that neighborhood . as a result , we expect that in an ising afm , an inert impurity like that of ref . would repulse the hole .",
    "bound states could only appear if a sufficiently strong exchange was turned on between the hole and the inert spin , so that the exchange energy gained through it compensated for the loss of kinetic energy .",
    "such a model was analyzed in ref . , although for the heisenberg model it was found that bound states persist only if this exchange with the inert site is rather weak .",
    "all these differences show that the underlying reasons for the appearance of bound states are very different in these other models .",
    "this is further substantiated by the fact that while a sublattice dependence is observed in refs .",
    ", it consists of a variation of the spectral weight but this is associated with the same eigenstates . by contrast , in our model , the two sublattices show different spectra of bound states .",
    "this result is important because it suggests that two very different patterns of bound states should be observed with scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in such systems , even if only one type of impurity is present .",
    "note that we assumed that the impurity is located directly at ( or above ) a lattice site .",
    "if , on the other hand , the impurity was located either half - way between two sites or in the center of the plaquettes , then it would not break the symmetry between the two sublattices and only one pattern of bound states should appear .",
    "these cases can be studied by similar means as presented here .",
    "a major simplifying factor of this problem was the assumption of an ising afm .",
    "if spin fluctuations are turned on , in a heisenberg afm , a major difference is that the hole no longer needs to go twice around closed loops in order to become delocalized : spin fluctuations can remove pairs of neighboring spin defects , thus cutting the string short and releasing the hole . as a result , one expects a significant decrease in the effective mass of the quasiparticle , which is indeed observed.@xcite however , it is interesting to note that if there is true long - range afm order in the plane ( as is the case in cuprates , due to coupling between planes ) , the resulting quasiparticle should continue to primarily reside on one sublattice , because spin fluctuations can only remove _ pairs _ of spin defects and spin conservation would continue to make the two sublattices inequivalent .",
    "this suggests that the results we present here , which are directly traceable to the fact that the quasiparticle lives on one sublattice , could be relevant for the heisenberg afm as well , although it is impossible to say _ a priori _ if the effective attraction generated when the quasiparticle and impurity are on different lattices would suffice to bind states ( we would still expect @xmath184-symmetry bound states to appear if the quasiparticle and impurity are on the same sublattice ) .",
    "a follow - up of this issue would be interesting .    in the broader context , these results confirm the view that coupling to bosonic degrees of freedom renormalizes not just a quasiparticle s dispersion , but also the effective disorder it sees .",
    "if the latter were not the case , no bound states could arise when the quasiparticle lives on a difference sublattice than the impurity .",
    "similar large and non - trivial renormalization of the disorder seen by a dressed quasiparticle , arising from its coupling to bosons , was also demonstrated for lattice polarons.@xcite    this work was supported by nserc , cifar , and qmi .",
