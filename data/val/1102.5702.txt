    "for all known particles , there is a remarkable one - to - one correspondence between their spin type and statistics type : @xmath2 @xmath3    in quantum field theory , this spin - statistics connection ( ssc ) can be understood in different ways . for free fields",
    ", the connection was established using conventional lagrangian and group - theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "interacting fields were tackled using axiomatic quantum field theory ( without any lagrangians ) , and by early 1960s the celebrated spin - statistics theorem was proved @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that the axiomatic treatment of the spin - statistics connection @xcite _ does not _ cover the case of quantum electrodynamics and other gauge theories including the standard model ( for a detailed explanation , see @xcite , sec .",
    ".    the physical root of this difficulty is the fact that while the photon is a massless spin-1 particle with only _ two _ polarizations , the corresponding 4-potential @xmath4 has _ four _ components .",
    "consequently , ordinary hilbert space with _ positive _ metric can not accomodate the 4-component field operator @xmath4 , and the introduction of _ indefinite - metric _ space is required .",
    "this is at odds with the axiom underlying the proof of the spin - statistics theorem , which states that the hilbert space metric must be _",
    "positive_.    as a result , the original set of axioms @xcite needs to be modified to include hilbert spaces with _",
    "indefinite _ metric as well .",
    "although progress has been achieved in this area ( see , e.g. , @xcite , ch.10 ) the extension of the spin - statistics theorem to gauge theories is yet to be formulated .    in any case",
    ", the theorem does not forbid small violation of the ssc and the question whether it exists or not remains open .",
    "( that does not mean , however , that construction of a theory with small statistics violation is easy . to date , most attempts to find a local relativistic quantum field theory with small statistics violation have been unsuccessful . )",
    "there have been several works that have attempted to improve the original spin - statistics theorem by going beyond the bose - fermi alternative @xcite , and , in particular , to rule out the small violation of ssc . however , they also assume positivity of hilbert space metric and hence do not apply to gauge theories .    even if the small ssc violation was shown to be theoretically forbidden on the basis of general principles of qft such as lorentz invariance , locality etc . , the experimental tests of ssc would still be of interest because they would be important tests of those general principles .",
    "we may assume that at some extremal or small enough distances where the usual notions of the local fields become invalid , their proper reconsideration and a generalisation should be required , which can bring us the possibility of changing or correcting the usual spin - statistics correspondence .",
    "since 1987 there have been significant theoretical and experimental efforts to motivate and find tiny departure from the established connection between spin and statistics .",
    "originally , most efforts [ 5 - 30 ] , especially in the experimental field , were actually concentrated on discussing small violation of the pauli exclusion principle rather than violation of bose statistics .",
    "many dedicated experiments have been performed to give strong bounds on the violation of the pauli principle .",
    "also , the topic was discussed in the context of string theories @xcite and cosmology @xcite . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "later , bose statistics came under scrutiny as well .",
    "initially , experimental proposals of searching for deviations from bose symmetry used the spin - zero nucleus of oxygen @xmath5 as the test object @xcite .    for a review of subsequent experiments with @xmath6 and @xmath7 molecules ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the first experimental upper limit on the validity of bose statistics for photons was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the idea of forbidden two - photon decays of z - boson .",
    "the same idea was later explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of low - energy , high - sensitivity atomic two - photon transitions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this approach exploits one of the important consequences of the bose symmetry , first observed by landau @xcite and yang @xcite : a pair of photons can not form a state with total angular momentum equal to unity . the landau - yang theorem uses general principles of rotation invariance , gauge invariance , and bose statistics to derive certain selection rules for decays of a parent particle into two photons . for a parent with spin one ,",
    "the decay amplitude into the exchange - symmetric state of two photons vanishes .",
    "therefore , the decay of any spin-1 boson into two photons is absolutely forbidden ( for a textbook proof , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if , however photons do not obey bose statistics , there will be a nonzero decay amplitude involving two photons in an exchange - antisymmetric state @xcite .",
    "this provides a clear reason why the diphoton system is especially interesting in testing the degree with which bose symmetry is exact .",
    "recent experiments have explored the possibility of small violations of the usual relationship between spin and statistics , which are impossible within conventional quantum field theory .",
    "experiments searching for the transitions between atomic states with @xmath8 and @xmath9 for degenerate photons ( i.e. photons of equal energies ) test the bose statistics at the ev scale and yield upper limit on the ratio @xmath10 of the rate of statistics - violating transitions to an equivalent statistics - allowed transition rate , @xmath11 at the 90% confidence level @xcite . at higher energies the limits on the branching fraction of two - photon decays of the triplet positronium ( orthopositronium ) @xmath12",
    "@xcite and charmonium @xmath13 @xcite have been reported . at the energy scale of 100 gev",
    "the results of the search for the gauge boson @xmath14 into two photons were obtained at lep @xcite @xmath15 .    from general arguments",
    ", one can expect that any violations of bose symmetry , if any , would be better manifested at higher energy scales .",
    "then the question arises : could interesting physics be found by combining the idea of searching for bose statistics violation and assumption that bose symmetry might be broken at a high energy frontier at the cern lhc ? out of all ( neutral ) spin 1 bosons it is natural to concentrate on the heaviest one- the new heavy gauge boson @xmath0 which appears naturally in many extensions of the sm .",
    "the explicit goal of this paper is to extend the results of the previos work [ 37 ] to the tev scale and to show that the search for the decay @xmath16 at the cern lhc could result in a more radical departure from standard physics : the possible observation of a small violation of bose statistics , which would provide strong evidence for the existence of new physics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sect.ii we describe the phenomenological model @xcite of the bose symmetry violation and its extensions ; we then show how the parameters of the model are constrained by theoretical arguments and electroweak precision data . following this , sec .",
    "iii deals with the @xmath0 sector in some detail . the main characteristics of the @xmath0 boson are described within the framework of several @xmath0 models .",
    "section iv - vi present the results of a sensitivity study for the bose symmetry violating process @xmath17 at the cern lhc at @xmath18 tev .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii presents the conclusions of this work .",
    "in this section we describe a simple model of bose symmetry violation suggested in ref . @xcite and its extensions .",
    "the method @xcite is to write down the most general form of the decay amplitude of the spin-1 particle into two photons and then apply the conditions of gauge invariance and bose symmetry to that amplitude .",
    "if both conditions are applied , the resulting amplitude is exactly zero .",
    "however , if we impose the condition of gauge invariance but do not require the bose symmetry , the resulting amplitude is not zero .",
    "we then can obtain the two - gamma decay rate of z - boson and compare it to the experimentally known upper bound on the branching ratio of @xmath19 . in this way a direct bound on bose symmetry violation for photons can be obtained @xcite .",
    "now , a few remarks about the relation of this method to alternative models of small bose symmetry violation .",
    "the most well - studied model is `` the quon model '' proposed in @xcite .",
    "quons are particles described by the commutation relations of the form : @xmath20 however , it was shown in ref.@xcite that in relativistic field theories quons must be either fermions or bosons .",
    "for this reason , the quon theory can not be used for the analysis of the decay @xmath19 .",
    "let us turn now to the construction of @xmath19 decay amplitude .",
    "we require that this amplitude satisfies all the standard conditions , such as relativistic invariance and gauge invariance , but we do not require this amplitude to be symmetric under the exchange of photon ends .",
    "the most general lorentz invariant form of the amplitude @xmath21 of the decay @xmath19 is : @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are photon momenta , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are photon polarization vectors , @xmath27 is @xmath14-boson polarization vector . even though violation of ssc could require violation of lorentz invariance as well , using more general parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) would be overkill .",
    "note that terms in @xmath28 proportional to @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not contribute to @xmath21 due to the conditions @xmath31 and can therefore be ignored .",
    "we focus first on the part of @xmath28 that does not contain the @xmath32-tensor : it has the following lorentz invariant form : @xmath33    now , the condition of the electromagnetic gauge invariance reads @xmath34 these conditions can be satisfied if we put @xmath35 then the amplitude @xmath28 becomes @xcite @xmath36    in principle , @xmath37 could depend on some scalar products of the momenta , but in our case , since all the particles are on mass shell , we have @xmath38 ( and , of course , @xmath39 ) , so that @xmath37 is a pure number . note that the above amplitude automatically satisfies the condition @xmath40 .",
    "we see that this amplitude , as expected , violates bose symmetry because @xmath41 whereas bose symmetry requires @xmath42 .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath37 can be interpreted as the parameter of bose statistics violation which will be marked by the subscript @xmath43 : @xmath44 .",
    "next , it can be shown that the following lorentz - invariant terms containing the @xmath32-tensor also satisfy the conditions of gauge invariance and bose - antisymmetry : @xmath45 and @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , calculating the width of the decay @xmath19 with the help of the amplitude eq.([c ] ) we obtain : @xmath47 experimentally , it has recently been measured at lep @xcite that @xmath48 therefore @xmath49 thus , taking into account that @xmath50 gev @xcite , finally , we can obtain our upper bound on the bose violating coupling @xmath51    we see that in the framework of this model the rate of the decay @xmath52 is small ; however , it can be enhanced for higher - mass particles . hence , the heavier spin-1 @xmath0 is a good candidate for the searching for effect of bose symmetry violation through the @xmath0 decay into two gammas .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the amplitudes of eq.([t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "the decay widths due to the amplitudes ( [ t1],[t2 ] ) are equal to : @xmath53 the corresponding upper bounds on the constants @xmath54 are : @xmath55    in the context of our approach , the reason for treating the three amplitudes separately is purely technical and does not involve the essential physics . indeed , adding the three amplitudes with three arbitrary coupling constants would be possible but it would only add considerable complexity and obscurity into experimental simulations without any gains in physical understanding .",
    "a few remarks are now in order concerning the relationship between the approaches developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a later work , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was claimed that the limit obtained in @xcite is too weak to be of any significance .",
    "this conclusion was reached within a very specific model for bose symmetry violation which is different from the model - independent approach suggested in @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of similarities and differences between the two frameworks would be out of place in the present paper , so we restrict ourselves to a few general comments only .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the difference is this : instead of constructing the most general bose - violating amplitude of the decay and the coupling constant @xmath56 , the authors of ref.@xcite introduce the `` probability for two photons to be in an antisymmetric state '' @xmath10 .",
    "the physical decay width @xmath57 is then obtained as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the width for the decay into ordinary `` bose - photons '' , and @xmath60 is the width of bose - symmetry violating decay into `` fermi - photons '' .",
    "for instance , if the decay amplitude for the usual , `` bose - photons '' 1 and 2 is @xmath61 , then the corresponding amplitude for `` fermi - photons '' would be @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this approach may look simple and natural , but five points should be kept in mind : 1 .",
    "well - known difficulties arise when @xmath10 is introduced . according to quantum mechanics ,",
    "every probability is the square of ( modulus of ) amplitude .",
    "so , after we introduced @xmath10 we must introduce the `` amplitude for two photons to be in an antisymmetric state '' , let us call it @xmath65 .",
    "so , the bose - violating two - photon state will be @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the normalization factor ) .",
    "next , due to superposition principle , we can add to it the state @xmath68 , obtaining @xmath69 .",
    "now , @xmath70 is obviously not properly normalized , and after normalization , it becomes just @xmath71 , i.e. `` amplitude for two photons to be in an antisymmetric state '' becomes 1 instead of @xmath65 .",
    "so it is hard to give physical meaning to the concept of `` probability for two photons to be in an antisymmetric state '' , unless superposition principle is modified in some way .",
    "it is believed @xcite that the ` bose ' and ` fermi ' amplitudes @xmath72 and @xmath73 do not interfere , i.e. , the total probability is assumed to be @xmath74 rather than @xmath75 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this assumption is justified by invoking the rule that the matrix elements of a symmetric hamiltonian has zero matrix elements between the states of different symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , this rule appears to be superfluous as the model @xcite itself dictates whether @xmath72 and @xmath73 interfere or not .",
    "indeed , in this model , the necessary and sufficient condition of non - interference is @xmath76 ( assuming for simplicity that @xmath65 is real ) .",
    "( it should be noted that whether the superposition is coherent or incoherent is irrelevant for the decay @xmath77 , which is forbidden at zeroth order . )",
    "should we consider @xmath10 is a ` universal ' parameter , i.e. , independent of the physical process , energy scale etc .",
    "? this may or may not be true depending on the details of the underlying specific theory . for instance , it is not inconceivable that @xmath10 could be energy - dependent and grow with energy . in this case ,",
    "upper limits on @xmath10 obtained in low- and high - energy processes would not be directly comparable to each other .    \\4 .",
    "finally , ref.@xcite makes ( implicitly ) a strong but arbitrary conjecture that the amplitude @xmath78 should be calculated _ in the standard model_. there is nothing wrong with it as long as we remember that : + this is just one of many possible assumptions , and certainly not the most general or unique .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath10 is meaningful only if this assumption is made .",
    "if we pursued a similar approach , the result would be that the rate of @xmath77 decay becomes rather small : due to a fermion loop it would be suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath79 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result",
    ", its search at lhc would require a higher sensitivity .",
    "by contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite did not rely on this or similar conjectures , but tried to be more general . in this general approach",
    ", there is no point in estimating @xmath10 , because this parameter belongs to a different model based on additional specific assumptions .",
    "we feel that at the moment our level of understanding is , unfortunately , insufficient for telling on purely theoretical grounds which approach is correct , and we need an experimental search that could settle the issue .",
    "consider now the new boson @xmath0 , which appears in many models of physics beyond the sm , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 is assumed to be a more massive than the gauge boson @xmath14 of the standard model .",
    "the most direct channel to probe the existence of the @xmath0 at a hadron collider , such as the cern lhc @xcite , is the drell - yan process .",
    "the @xmath0 that decay to leptons , @xmath80 with @xmath81 , have a simple , clean experimental signature , and potentially could be discovered at the lhc with a mass up to 5 tev , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "this new object is supposed to be neutral , colorless and self - adjoint , i.e. , it is its own antiparticle .",
    "the mass of the new boson could be identified unambiguously by a study of a resonance peak in the dilepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath0 may be classified according to its spin , which could be defined by measuring the dilepton angular distribution in the reconstructed @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "the @xmath0 could be a spin-0 @xmath82 in r - parity violating susy , a spin-2 kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitation of the graviton as in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model , or even a spin-1 kk excitation of a sm gauge boson from some extra dimensional model @xcite .",
    "another possibility for the spin-1 case is that the @xmath0 is a true @xmath0 , i.e. a new neutral gauge boson , which is the carrier of a new force , arising from an extension of the sm gauge group . for much more extensive discussions of specific models and other implications",
    "see several excellent reviews @xcite , and a more complete list of references therein .",
    "the current best direct experimental lower limits on the mass of @xmath0 of a few popular models came from the tevatron and restrict the @xmath0 mass to be greater than about 900 gev when its couplings to sm fermions are identical to those of the z boson @xcite .",
    "consider now the allowed branching fraction @xmath83 in several interesting @xmath0 models .",
    "first , we shortly describe these models and the sm fermions couplings the @xmath0 .    *",
    "the e@xmath84 models are described by the breaking chain @xmath85 .",
    "many studies of @xmath0 are focusing on the two extra @xmath86 which occur in the above decomposition of the @xmath87 .",
    "the lightest @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath88 where the values @xmath89 and @xmath90 corresponds to pure @xmath91 and @xmath92 states of the @xmath93- and @xmath94-model , respectively .",
    "the value @xmath95 is related to a @xmath96 boson that would originate from the direct breaking of @xmath87 to a rank-5 group in superstrings inspired models . *",
    "the left - right symmetric ( lrsm ) model is based on the symmetry group @xmath97 @xcite , in which @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the baryon and lepton numbers , respectively .",
    "the model necessarily incorporates three additional gauge bosons @xmath100 and @xmath0 .",
    "the most general @xmath0 is coupled to a linear combination of right - handed and @xmath101 currents : @xmath102 where @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the @xmath106 and @xmath107 coupling constant with @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath109-parameter is restricted to be in the range @xmath110 .",
    "the upper bound corresponds to the so - called manifest lrsm with @xmath111 , while the lower bound corresponds to the @xmath93-model discussed above , since @xmath112 can results to both @xmath113 and @xmath114 breaking parameter . to simplify our study",
    ", we will use further the following standard assumptions : ( i ) the mixing angles are small ; ( ii ) right - handed ckm matrix is identical to the left - handed one , and ( iii ) @xmath115 . * in the sequential model ( ssm ) the corresponding @xmath0 boson has the same couplings to fermions as the @xmath14 of the sm . the @xmath0 could be considered as an excited state of the ordinary @xmath14 in models with extra dimensions at the weak scale . * the stueckelberg extension of the sm ( stsm ) is based on the gauge group @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "this extension of the sm involves a mixing of the @xmath117 hypercharge gauge field and the @xmath118 stueckelberg gauge field .",
    "the stueckelberg gauge field has no couplings to the visible sector fields , while it may couple to a hidden sector , and thus the new physical @xmath0 gauge boson connects with the visible sector only via mixing with the gauge bosons of the physical sector .",
    "these mixings , however , must be small because of the lep electroweak constraints and consequently the couplings of the @xmath0 boson to the visible matter fields are extra weak , leading to a very narrow @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the width of such a boson could be as low as a few mev or even lower .",
    "an exploration of the stueckelberg @xmath0 boson in the tevatron data was recently carried out in @xcite .",
    "such a resonance may also be detectable via the drell - yan process at the lhc by an analysis of a dilepton pair arising from the @xmath0 decay @xcite .",
    "the coupling structure of the stueckelberg @xmath0 gauge boson with visible matter fields is suppressed by small mass mixing parameters thus leading to a very narrow @xmath0 resonance .",

    "an important point is that if the decays of the @xmath0 into leptons occur , the position of the @xmath0 mass peak and its expected experimental width in the diphoton invariant mass distribution can be predicted by the analysis of on - peak data based on the observation of a leptonic @xmath0 decay mode .",

    "we consider a photon in the ecal as a local deposition of electromagnetic energy by electrons or photons contained in a cone @xmath170 with no associated tracks .",
    "this definition is equivalent to @xmath171 crystal size in the cms detector .",
    "the cms experiment uses @xmath172 crystal size to form an energy cluster to reconstruct a photon candidate .",
    "however , in our efforts to mimic this reconstruction process at the generator level , we choose to be conservative and use only a @xmath171 crystal .",
    "the momentum of the photon candidate is defined as the vector sum of the momenta of the electromagnetic objects in such a crystal .    as mentioned above",
    ", the main challenge to identifying the true photon candidates arises from jets faking photons , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this occurs when a jet from the standard model processes with @xmath153 or @xmath173 final state is dominated by a neutral hadron , such as , for example , a @xmath155 or @xmath174 , which decays into two photons .",
    "if the hadron is highly energetic , so that the cosine of the opening angle between the two decay photons is @xmath175 , this angle is difficult to resolve and the photons can be misidentified as a single energetic photon .",
    "to suppress such backgrounds , we use various isolation variables , without , however , taking into account such photon object characteristics as the lateral and longitudinal electromagnetic shower shape . jets typically have a larger number of charged particles reconstructed in their vicinty , and also a larger ratio of hadronic to electromagnetic deposited energy than photons .",
    "likewise , hadronic and electromagnetic deposits arising from jets will be less isolated than for photons .",
    "fake photon signals arising from a jet can be rejected by requiring either the absence of charged tracks above a certain minimum transverse momentum(@xmath176 ) associated with the photon or the absence of additional energetic particles in an annular cone ( @xmath177 ) around the photon candidate . following the diphoton analysis similar to ref.@xcite , we have considered two variables for the isolation purposes : ( i ) the number of tracks ( @xmath178 ) from charged particles , such as @xmath179 , inside a cone around the photon and ( ii ) the scalar sum of transverse energy ( @xmath180 ) inside a cone around the photon .",
    "to identify the photons from the decay @xmath1 , the following @xmath181 events selection criteria are used :    * @xmath182 gev , @xmath183 gev ; * @xmath184 , @xmath185 ; * @xmath186 ; * @xmath187 for @xmath188 gev within @xmath189 ; * @xmath190 gev within @xmath189 ;    using this algorithm and requiring the photon to be isolated , the estimated probability of a jet faking a photon in @xmath191 channel is @xmath192 .",
    "the major sources of fake photons are @xmath155 ( @xmath193 ) , with the rest coming from other sources .    as the next step",
    ", the signal event candidates are selected by requiring that the final state contain at least two or more isolated photons and a jet(s ) .",
    "events are studied in which either both photons are in the barrel calorimeter , or one photon is in the barrel and the other is in the end cup calorimeter .",
    "the diphoton invariant mass distribution is calculated for two highest @xmath194 photons and histogrammed in bins equivalent to the mass resolution .",
    "the combined acceptance and selection efficiency for events with @xmath195 gev and for @xmath196 gev is found to be @xmath197 .",
    "in fig .  [ plot ] the invariant mass @xmath198 distributions in the presence of the standard model background are shown for events simulated for the lrsm and e@xmath84(@xmath199 ) models for the @xmath0 with the mass of 1.5 tev , the bose violating coupling @xmath147 , and the lhc integrated luminosity @xmath200 .",
    "the additional broad peak and long tails below the @xmath0 peak are from a combinatorial background due to the wrong choice of photons . for the invariant @xmath151-mass @xmath201 1 tev ,",
    "the background under the @xmath0 peak drops quickly .",
    "distribution in the presence of the sm background calculated for the lrsm and e@xmath202 models for the @xmath0 with the mass of 1.5 tev and the lhc integrated luminosity @xmath200 .",
    "the bose violating coupling is assumed to be @xmath147 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the significance of the discovery of the @xmath1 events can be estimated as @xcite : @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are the numbers of signal and background events respectively , which pass the selection criteria described above .",
    "these numbers of events are estimated from a search for the @xmath1 mass peak , which was performed in the following way .",
    "for every @xmath0 mass value , the region around it in the @xmath206 distribution was fitted with a parametrized signal shape centered at the @xmath206 value and superimposed over a polynomial background .",
    "the normalization of each component is allowed to float in the fit .",
    "this procedure is also used for the background estimate as a function of @xmath206 , with statistical uncertainties propagated from the fits .",
    "the systematic errors discussed below are also propagated to the fit procedure .",
    "the discovery potential of the @xmath1 decay with the cms detector is estimated assuming @xmath207 .",
    "the final results of this analysis are presented in fig.[limits ] , where the most stingent limits for the coupling constant @xmath208 obtained for the lrs model are shown as a function of @xmath0 mass . for the total luminosity of 100 fb@xmath209 and the mass about 1 tev , the limits are about one order of magnitude lower than the corresponding present limit from the search for @xmath210 decay mode at lep , thus making the process @xmath139",
    "feasible for observation at the lhc .",
    "for the higher integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath209 , the use of @xmath211 reaction allows to probe the decay @xmath1 for the @xmath0 masses up to 2 tev .",
    "the systematic errors in the number of expected @xmath1 events coming from various background uncertainties are small since the background itself is rather small and the discovery region is usually limited by the fast drop of the signal cross section at high @xmath0 mass .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainties of the expected number of @xmath0-bosons arise from the luminosity measurement ( 6% ) and the choice of pdf ( 5% ) .",
    "the latter uncertainty is determined from the variation in the efficiency when employing different pdf parameterizations . to study the effect of the detector energy resolution on this analysis , the energy of the photons was smeared with the stochastic term of the cms electromagnetic calorimeter energy resolution @xcite . due to limitations in computing time",
    ", we did not fully simulate the background from jet - jet events .",
    "although the dijet cross section is quite large , given the low probability of a jet faking a photon it is found that the kinematical and isolation cuts used above reject the dijet background substantially @xcite .",
    "to get conservative estimate , we include uncertainties in the background estimate of 15% .",
    "finally , the error of the measured lhc integrated luminosity is taken to be 3% @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we consider a phenomenological model of the bose statistics violation . we show that if a new heavy @xmath0 boson is observed at lhc , further searches for the @xmath139 decay mode would suggest an interesting additional direction to probe bose symmetry violation at the high energy frontier .",
    "we have demonstrated that the discovery regions in the ( @xmath212 ) parameter space for the @xmath1 decay substantially extend the excluded region from the cern lep .",
    "the low - energy experiment in atomic spectroscopy might be a sensitive probe of bose symmetry violation that is complementary to collider experiments .",
