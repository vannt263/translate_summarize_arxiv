    "nearly half a century ago it has already been realized that the decay of mesons produced in the interactions of high energy cosmic rays ( crs ) with matter and radiation in / near the cosmic ray sources , in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , can produce detectable fluxes of high energy gamma rays ( @xmath0 s ) , neutrinos ( @xmath1 s ) and positrons ( @xmath2 s ) , which carry unique information on the ultra relativistic universe ( e.g. , zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ; berezinsky & smirnov  1975 ; margolis et al .  1978 ; eichler  1978 ; eichler & schramm 1978 ; stecker  1979 ) .",
    "in particular , interaction of cosmic rays with diffuse matter and/or radiation in / near the cosmic ray sources , in the ism of galaxies and the igm has long been recognized as possible point and diffuse sources of very high energy galactic and extragalactic @xmath0-rays and neutrinos ( see , e.g. , dar  1983,1985,1991 ; halzen et al .  1990 ; berezinsky 1991 ; stecker et al .  1991 ;",

    "1998 ) , have led to the development of new generations of much larger and more sensitive telescopes of high energy @xmath0-rays , neutrinos and cosmic rays , which have already made several breakthrough observations .",
    "such breakthroughs include the discovery of a diffuse high energy neutrino background radiation ( nbr ) with the megaton icecube detector under the south pole ( aartsen et al .",
    "2013,2014,2015 ) , the accurate measurement of the diffuse high energy gamma - ray background radiation ( gbr ) with the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard the fermi satellite ( ackermann et al .",
    "2012,2015 ) , and the precise measurements of the high energy local background of cosmic ray positrons with the payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ( pamela ) satellite ( adriani et al .  2013 ) and the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams ) aboard the international space station ( aguilar et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "possible sources and the detailed properties of the observed astronomical neutrinos , @xmath0-rays and positrons were discussed in the discovery papers and in a large number of publications , which followed the observations ( for a recent review see , e.g. , anchordoqui et al .",
    "but , most of the published theoretical estimates of the fluxees of the high energy neutrinos , @xmath0-rays and positrons from point sources and diffuse sources , both before and after these recent breakthrough observations , were fraught with uncertainties concerning the production mechanisms of the high energy neutrinos , @xmath0-rays and positrons and the properties of their sources , which have left the origin and observed properties of these radiations essentially unsolved puzzles .    in view of such dificulties ,",
    "several authors have tried alternative approaches towards resolving these puzzles , such as deriving upper bounds on the observed fluxes of the high energy astronomical neutrinos , gamma - rays and positrons , or general relations between them , which may indicate their origin .",
    "e.g. , a highly cited `` model - independent upper bound '' on the energy flux of extragalactic nbr above 100 tev was derived by waxman & bahcall ( 1999 ) .",
    "it was based on the assumption that the nbr is produced by the decay of @xmath4 s produced by the extragalactic cosmic ray protons in proton - photon collisions in the extragalctic cr sources . however , as shown in appendix a1 , the `` model independent upper bound '' of waxman & bahcall ( 1999 ) , actually , is a model dependent estimate based on an incorrect extrapolation of the observed flux of extragalactic crs to lower energies and on incomplete consequences of their arbitrary choices .",
    "when properly corrected , this `` upper bound '' increases by nearly _ two orders of magnitude ! _ ( see appendix a1 ) and becomes useless .",
    "other authors have tried to relate the nbr discovered with icecube and the high energy gamma - ray background radiation ( gbr ) measured with fermi - lat , assuming that both were produced in hadronic interactions of high energy cosmic rays ( e.g. , murase et al .",
    "2013 ; anchordoqui et al .",
    "2014a and references therein ) .",
    "however , most of these attempts were based on the uncertain assumptions that the nbr is mostly extragalactic in origin and that the very high energy @xmath0-rays from blazars and other extragalactic point sources are leptonic in origin .",
    "consequently , the nbr was related only to the diffuse intergalactic gamma - ray background ( igrb ) , ignoring the possibility of a much larger galactic contribution and an extragalactic contribution ( e.g. from blazars ) :    multiwavelength observations of blazars have shown that their spectral energy density usually exhibits two bumps , one at low energy ( infrared to x - rays ) and one at high energy ( see , e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "the origin of the high energy bump near tev is still under debate ( see , e.g. , cerruti et al .  2015 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , current cherenkov telescopes have identified a population of ultra - high - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( uhbls ) , which exhibit exceptionally hard tev spectra .",
    "this hard emission , as well as the high energy emission in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) challenge the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) model ( e.g. , konigl 1981 ) of very high energy @xmath0-ray emission from blazar jets ( maraschi et al .",
    "1992 ; bloom & marscher 1996 ) and from grb jets ( e.g. , dado & dar  2005,2009 ) . in particular , the standard one zone synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) interpretation of the double peaked blazer spectra ( see e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) implies that the ssc peak frequency is inversely proportional to the synchrotron peak frequency because of the klein nishina suppression of the high energy inverse compton scattering cross section .",
    "such a correlation does not seem to be present in the observational data .",
    "in fact , the klein - nishina suppression of inverse compton scattering of background photons by high energy electrons and the suppression of the population of high energy electrons by synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering from background photons suggest that @xmath5 decay following inclusive production and decay of mesons in jets encounters with diffuse matter may become the dominant production mechanism of very high energy photons emitted by blazars ( dar & shaviv 1996 ; dar & laor  1997 ) and grbs ( dado & dar  2005,2009 ) .    if the main origin of the very high energy astronomical neutrinos and @xmath0-rays and cr positrons observed near earth is the decay of mesons produced in high energy cr collisions with diffuse matter in / near the cr sources , and/or in the ism , and/or in the igm , then under very general assumptions their fluxes , spectra and sky distributions are simply related . in this paper",
    ", we reconsider such relations ( e.g. , dado & dar 2014 ) and confront them with observations rather than prejudices .",
    "indeed , we show that the high energy nbr observed with icecube and the gbr observed with fermi - lat ( and the high energy cherenkov telescopes ) satisfy the simple relations expected from hadronic production of mesons by high energy cosmic rays in collisions with diffuse matter in / near source ( rather than with diffuse radiation - see appendix a2 ) .",
    "they imply a non isotropic nbr whose sky distribution is similar to that of the fermi - lat gbr . we also show that the flux of the high energy cr positrons observed near earth with pamela and ams02 is that expected from secondary production of mesons in the local ism by the flux of cosmic ray nucleons ( protons and nucleons bound in atomic nuclei ) observed near earth .",
    "hadronic collisions of high energy nucleons of energy @xmath6 with diffuse matter produce @xmath0-rays , @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s mainly through @xmath9 and k decays .",
    "if the lab frame energy e of these secondary particles is expressed as @xmath10 , the distribution of x is independent of @xmath6 to a good approximation ( feynman  1969 ) .",
    "consequently , a flux @xmath11 of crs in a diffuse matter produces through hadronic collisions secondary @xmath0-rays , @xmath7 s , and @xmath8 s with a flux per unit volume ( e.g. , dar  1983 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 , the mean value @xmath14 depends only on the distribution of x in the inclusive production @xmath15 but not on e , @xmath16 is the mean energy of cosmic ray protons that produce particles i with energy e , and @xmath17 mb is the pp total inelastic cross section .",
    "( 1 ) implies that cr collisions with diffuse matter produce secondary fluxes of @xmath0-rays , @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s with the same power - law spectrum @xmath18 and different normalization .",
    "these fluxes are later modified by propagation effects : attenuation of high energy @xmath0- rays mainly by compton scattering from free electrons and by pair production on background photons , oscillations of neutrinos in space that spread the neutrino flux over the three neutrino flavors , diffusion propagation of high energy @xmath8 s in magnetic fields , and energy loss of @xmath8 s by synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering of background photons .",
    "we shall assume that the main kinds of sources of high energy cosmic rays ( supernova explosions , merger of compact stars , and mass accretion onto compact stars , stellar mass black holes and massive black holes ) are common to our galaxy and external galaxies , that fermi acceleration ( fermi  1949 ) and galactic confinement produce a power - law spectrum @xmath19 of galactic crs , and that the main source of background @xmath0-rays and neutrinos above tev is hadronic collisions of these high energy crs with diffuse matter inside or near the cr sources , in the ism of their host galaxies , and in the igm , which produce mesons ( mostly pions and k mesons ) that decay to high energy @xmath20-rays , @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s .",
    "the assumption of hadronic rather than leptonic production is based on the facts that inverse compton scattering of background photons by high energy electrons is suppressed by the klein nishina cross section and that the population of high energy electrons is suppressed by synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering from background photons .",
    "( photoproduction has an effective threshold too high to explain the high energy gbr observed below tev )",
    ". the hadronic production hypothesis , mostly overlooked , will be confronted here with observations rather than with prejudices .",
    "consider first hadronic production cf high energy @xmath0-rays and neutrinos by cosmic ray collisions with diffuse matter inside or near the cr sources .",
    "the local flux of high energy cosmic ray nucleons ( free protons and nucleons bound in atomic nuclei that hereafter will be denoted by p ) between several gev and the cosmic ray knee energy @xmath21 1 pev / nucleon is well described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( e.g. , olive et al .  2014 ) , and @xmath25 is the flux unit . between the cr knee and cr ankle at e@xmath26 3 eev , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( apel et al .  2013 ) .",
    "we will ignore the small differences between cr protons and nucleons bound in cr nuclei ( a , z ) at the same energy per nucleon , because such nucleons contribute only a few percents to the total cr p flux and most of them are bound in light nuclei whose inelastic cross section per nucleon is @xmath29 , i.e. , roughly the same as that of free protons .",
    "cr protons escape the galaxy by diffusion through its turbulent magnetic fields . for a kolmogorov spectrum ( kolmogorov  1941 ) of random magnetic fields",
    ", their escape time satisfies @xmath30 . in a steady state ,",
    "the supply rate of high energy cr protons by the galactic cr sources ( s ) per unit volume is equal to their escape rate from the galaxy .",
    "hence , the source spectrum of cr protons satisfies @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "roughly , @xmath33 for @xmath34 , which is consistent with fermi acceleration modified by escape by diffusion , and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "we shall assume that above 100 gev the contribution of electron bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering of background photons to the gbr , that decreases with increasing energy , becomes relatively small compared to the contribution from galactic and extragalactic @xmath37-ray production by @xmath38 decays .",
    "neutrinos are produced mainly by @xmath39 and k decays .",
    "as long as the neutrinos and @xmath40-rays are produced mainly through @xmath39 decay by crs with energy below the cr knee whose in / near source spectral index is @xmath41 , their fluxes satisfy @xmath42 per @xmath1 flavor . at higher energies",
    "neutrinos are produced mainly through @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays followed by @xmath45 decay , and in @xmath46 and + @xmath47 decays followed by the @xmath48 and @xmath49 decays .",
