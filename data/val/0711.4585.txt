    "chaotic billiards are fundamental paradigms in statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics . by connecting dynamics with geometry ,",
    "billiards serve as models to address numerous questions ranging from the foundations of the ergodic hypothesis  @xcite and the description of shell effects  @xcite to the design of microcavity lasers @xcite and microwave resonators  @xcite , among other applications  @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of billiard systems is that simple geometries , such as those in fig .",
    "[ fig.compa ] , suffice to give rise to a rich variety of dynamical behavior observed in typical hamiltonian systems . but as previously observed for specific chaotic billiards , simple geometries may also lead to the existence of the so - called _ bouncing - ball orbits _ : one - parameter families of periodic orbits exhibiting perpendicular motion between parallel walls",
    ". theoretical and experimental work on the sinai [ fig .",
    "[ fig.compa](c ) ] and bunimovich stadium [ fig .",
    "[ fig.compa](d ) ] billiards have shown that such orbits have a major influence on transport properties , decay of correlations , and spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "this is so because , contrary to the other orbits embedded in the chaotic component of the phase space , bouncing - ball orbits are only marginally unstable ( i.e. , perturbations grow only linearly in time ) . in general , marginally unstable periodic orbits ( mupos ) can be regarded as a source of regular behavior that masks strong chaotic properties .",
    "however , mupos are not structurally stable and may be destroyed by small changes in the parameters of the system . therefore , mupos are considered to be non - generic and it has long been assumed that they could exist only for very special systems , like billiards with parallel walls .",
    "contrary to this expectation , in this paper we show that mupos are prevalent in a large class of billiard systems .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the observation that many of the most widely studied chaotic billiards consist of _ local _ perturbations of an integrable billiard . for concrete examples ,",
    "consider the chaotic billiards shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig.compa ] .",
    "all these billiards can be obtained by re - defining the dynamics in the gray region of the integrable billiards in figs .",
    "[ fig.compa](a)-(c ) , e.g. , by introducing a scatterer .",
    "it can be shown that any orbit ( _ i _ ) lying inside the chaotic component and ( _ ii _ ) not interacting with the introduced scatterers will be a mupo . although bouncing - ball orbits evidently satisfy these conditions in the billiards of figs .",
    "[ fig.compa](d)-(h ) , the existence of such orbits is far from clear in general . here",
    "we use geometric and analytical arguments to demonstrate the widespread occurrence of mupos . specifically , using circular - like billiards as model systems  such as those in figs .",
    "[ fig.compa](f)-(g )  we show that _ infinitely _ many families of mupos exist for almost all parameter choices of the system .",
    "we discuss the impact of these structures on the dynamics of chaotic orbits as well as the experimental observation of mupos in the quantum spectrum of microwave annular billiards .     in ( b )",
    "is the radius of the smallest circle that circumscribes all scatterers ) .",
    "mupos are shown here to exist in billiards such as ( d ) sinai  @xcite , ( e ) stadium  @xcite , ( f ) annular  @xcite , ( g ) mushroom  @xcite , and ( h ) elliptical with scatterers  @xcite . ]",
    "the _ local _ perturbations described above are typical for billiard systems and differ fundamentally from the _ global _ perturbations considered in smooth hamiltonian systems . in the latter , the kam theory shows that most quasi - periodic orbits of the integrable system survive the perturbation , while all periodic orbits with marginal stability disappear .",
    "quite the opposite happens in the former case : a large set of quasi - periodic orbits disappears but there are families of periodic orbits with marginal stability that survive the perturbation by `` avoiding '' interaction with the localized scatterers .",
    "these orbits give rise to families of mupos detached from regular regions , which were previously observed in billiards with parallel walls  @xcite , and for specific parameters of the mushroom billiard  @xcite . here",
    "we consider _ generic _ control parameters of a wide class of systems where we characterize the mupos both theoretically and experimentally .",

    "the above mentioned results can be immediately extended to other chaotic billiards defined by local perturbations of integrable systems and are expected to find applications in both classical and quantum studies .",
    "classically , general arguments on marginal instability can be used to show that the resulting stickiness of chaotic trajectories to mupos generates a universal power law @xmath93 for the survival probability of nearby particles  @xcite .",
    "this scaling is expected to hold for long times , while fluctuations ( nonperiodic echoes ) occur for short times  @xcite .",
