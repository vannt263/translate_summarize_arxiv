    "multi - wavelength observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) suggest the presence of various emission components with different relative weights in different agn classes . the large number of parameters involved in physical models of emission mechanisms can hardly be constrained by single epoch observations .",
    "multi - band variability studies are then crucial in identifying and constraining individual components .",
    "moreover , active nuclei are not spatially resolved in general .",
    "for this reason variability time scales , delays and correlations between variations in different continuum components or emission lines provide the main information about the location of different components .",
    "the very definition of agn classes is in part based on variability properties . in fact , while quasars ( qsos ) and seyfert galaxies vary , on average , less than 0.5 mag on time scales of months in the optical band , blazars ( i.e. bl lac objects and optically violent variables , ovvs ) may change their luminosities by more than one mag in a few days @xcite . quantifying spectral variability will then help understanding different agn classes by comparison . although monitoring campaigns , from radio to x - ray wavelengths , exist for a limited number of objects , they are difficult to realize with adequate time sampling and duration . for this reason we try to exploit multi - band variability studies limited to the optical range , which in some case are available for several objects and relatively long observing periods . in a previous paper @xcite analyzed the spectral slope variability of a sample of pg qsos on the basis of the light curves in the b and r bands , provided by the wise observatory group , who monitored 42 quasars for 7 years with a typical sampling interval of about one month @xcite",
    "a spectral variability parameter @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the specific flux and @xmath2 the spectral slope , was defined by @xcite who derived constraints on variability mechanisms from the average @xmath3 and @xmath4 values .",
    "in particular they showed that the variation of spectral slope implied by changes of the accretion rate are not able to explain @xmath4 values deduced from the observations , while `` hot spots '' on the accretion disc , possibly caused by instability phenomena @xcite , can easily account for the observed spectral variability . in the present study",
    "we analyze b , v , r , i light curves of eight bl lac objects obtained by @xcite in a monitoring campaign of about 5 years with an average sampling interval of @xmath5 days .",
    "we show that bl lacs clearly differ from qsos in their @xmath6 distribution .",
    "we show that a simple model representing the variability of a synchrotron component can account for the observed @xmath3 and @xmath4 values and we discuss constraints which can be derived from spectral variability on the amount of thermal radiation contributed by a disk component in the optical band .",
    "the sample consists of 8 radio selected bl lac objects listed in table 1 .",
    "observations were made in the period 1995 - 1999 , in the standard johnson - cousins b , v , r , i bands and are described in @xcite .",
    "typical photometric uncertainties range from 0.01 to 0.03 mag r.m.s .. in table 1 the following quantities are reported : _ column 1 _ - name ; _ column 2 _ - coordinate designation ; _ column 3 _ - number of observations ; _ column 4 _ - average b magnitude ; _ column 5 _ - redshift ; _ column 6 _ - average spectral slope ; _ column 7 _ - spectral variability index . for the present analysis",
    "we regard as `` simultaneous '' the observations in different bands taken during the same observing night .",
    "we considered the data dereddened as in @xcite .",
    "we then define for each object an `` instantaneous '' slope by a straight line fit through the b , v , r , i data points as a function of @xmath7 , neglecting for the moment any curvature of the spectral energy distribution within the optical range .",
    "a positive correlation of the instantaneous spectral slope @xmath2 with flux changes",
    "@xmath8 has been already discussed by @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we quantify spectral variations in two different ways .",
    "a first method considers , for each object , all the positions in the @xmath9 diagram , @xmath10 is the specific flux at the effective frequency @xmath11 of the blue band",
    ". these points , together with the relevant regression lines are shown in figure 1 for each of the 8 objects . in the same figure",
    "the solid lines represent the average increase of @xmath3 with @xmath12 .",
    "clearly this quantity is independent of the time at which @xmath3 and @xmath12 values are measured .",
    "we refer to the blue band , instead of the red one used by @xcite in their correlation analysis , for comparison with the study of qso spectral variations by @xcite .",
    "the slopes @xmath13 of the regression lines of each object can be assumed as a first spectral variability index .    a second method , adopted by @xcite considers , for each object , the quantity : @xmath14 which represents the change of spectral slope per unit variation of log flux as a function of the rest frame time lag @xmath15 and again we refer to the flux changes in the blue band . we stress that @xmath4 is a very sensitive indicator of spectral changes but , for this reason , it is also a noisy quantity . for flux changes comparable or smaller than the photometric noise , @xmath4 values are randomly spread over a wide range .",
    "thus we limit the computation to @xmath16 . in any case , instead of individual @xmath17 values , it s worth referring to average values , e.g. in bins of time lag @xmath18 .",
    "to constrain physical models of variability , it s interesting to see whether spectral changes are different on different time scales .",
    "figure 2 shows for each object @xmath17 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the mean values of @xmath17 in bins of 200 days are also shown .",
    "the errors represent the standard deviation of the mean , which has been computed according to @xcite , to take into account correlation among @xmath17 values within each bin . for each object the value of the first spectral variability index @xmath13 is also shown for comparison . in general the larger variations of @xmath4 occur at larger time lags where , due to the worst statistic , they are less reliable . for @xmath19 d",
    "there are no evident systematic trends of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "thus it makes sense to define a less noisy index taking the average of @xmath4 within the first 500 days : @xmath20 in the following we limit our analysis to the average variability index @xmath4 .",
    "besides the spectral slope @xmath3 computed by a straight line fit through the @xmath21 versus @xmath22 ( i = b , v , r , i ) data points , we also computed two other slope values , towards the blue and red side of the spectral range : @xmath23}{\\log ( { \\lambda_b}/{\\lambda_r } ) } -2 , \\quad    \\alpha_{vi}=\\frac{0.4[(v - i)-(v_o - r_o)]}{\\log ( { \\lambda_v}/{\\lambda_i } ) } -2,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the zero points and the effective wavelengths of the four photometric bands @xcite . for all but two objects the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively slightly larger and slightly smaller , on average , than @xmath3 , indicating a little curvature of the spectrum , and the slopes of the linear regressions @xmath27 vs. @xmath3 and @xmath26 vs. @xmath3 do not differ significantly from one . in the case of bl lac and oq 530 , @xmath26 is almost equal to @xmath27 , or slightly smaller , and becomes significantly smaller than @xmath3 ( and @xmath27 ) when @xmath3 is small .",
    "a possible explanation is that the ( constant ) contribution of the host galaxy emerges in the faint phases causing a more marked softening of the spectrum on the red side of the wavelength interval considered .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the host galaxy contribution , as reported by @xcite , is relatively strong for these two objects .",
    "the average values @xmath4 of the variability index , for all time lags smaller than 500 days rest - frame , are plotted in figure 3 versus the relevant average @xmath3 values .",
    "for comparison the values for the sample of 42 quasars discussed by @xcite are also shown values for qsos are slightly different from those shown in @xcite since they have been recomputed at a fixed _ rest - frame _ time lag interval , and taking the average over 500 instead of 1000 days for consistency . ] .",
    "bl lacs and quasars are clearly segregated in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "bl lacs show , on average , lower @xmath3 values , consistently with the absence , or lower relative weight , of the thermal blue bump component .",
    "the new information in figure 3 is that bl lacs have @xmath4 values smaller , on average , than quasars .",
    "bl lac variability is stronger , @xmath3 changes are also larger , but their ratio @xmath4 is smaller .",
    "moreover , using both @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters together allows a clear distinction of the two classes .",
    "we want to discuss whether this behavior fits into the currently accepted models describing the different emission mechanisms of blazars and qsos .",
    "the continuum spectral energy distribution of blazars from radio frequencies to x and @xmath29-rays can be explained by a synchrotron emission plus inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "variability can be produced by an intermittent channeling into the jet of the energy produced by the central engine .",
    "@xcite have considered a detailed model where crossing of different shells of material , ejected with different velocities , produce shocks which heat the electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission .",
    "the resulting spectra are compared with multi - band , multi - epoch observations of 3c 279 from radio to @xmath29 frequencies , showing a good agreement .",
    "similar computations have been done for mkn 421 @xcite . in the case of the eight objects of our sample ,",
    "b , v , r , i bands are sampling variability of the synchrotron component . this component can be roughly described by a broken power law characterized by the break ( or peak in @xmath30 ) frequency @xmath31 and the asymptotic spectral slopes @xmath32 and @xmath33 at low and high frequency respectively , @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "an equivalent representation is : @xmath36^{-1 } \\equiv l_p \\cdot h(\\nu/\\nu_p;\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the specific luminosity at @xmath31 .",
    "we adopt this representation for a stationary component of the sed and we add to it a second ( variable ) component with the same analytical form but different peak frequency @xmath38 and amplitude @xmath39 to produce spectral changes :    @xmath40    the addition of the second component mimics the behavior of the synchrotron emission of model spectra when shell crossing occurs , producing an increment of emission with @xmath41 , due to newly accelerated electrons . with such a representation",
    "we can compute @xmath3 and @xmath4 as a function of @xmath42 , for different values of @xmath31 and given values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath43 .",
    "we adopted typical values of the asymptotic slopes @xmath44 , @xmath45 , we assigned to @xmath31 different values in the range 2.5 - 10 @xmath46 hz , and we made @xmath42 vary in the range 0.8 - 4 .",
    "we also adopted a ratio @xmath43 corresponding to a 0.5 mag change in the blue band , which is representative of the r.m.s . variability .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 , where we use as @xmath3 the slope of the stationary component .",
    "the three different lines are computed for @xmath47 from left to right respectively .",
    "the computed curves fall naturally in the region occupied by the data , namely it is possible to account for the position of the objects in the @xmath28 plane with typical values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath42 and @xmath31 , required to represent the overall sed of the objects considered ( see * ? ? ?",
    "bl lac objects can be classified according to the break frequency of synchrotron emission , from low frequency peaked bl lacs ( lbl ) which show a break in the ir / optical band to high frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) with the synchrotron break at uv / x - ray ( or higher ) energies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". on average the blue bump ( tb ) produced by the accretion disk tends to be negligible in hbls while in lbls its contribution may be important .",
    "according to @xcite this can be interpreted in terms of higher accretion rate @xmath48 in the case of lbls , producing a stronger thermal emission from the disk , while hbls are dominated by non - thermal energy , partly extracted from rotational energy of the central kerr hole .",
    "in particular the tb remains negligible during changes of the synchrotron component in the case of mkn 421 , a classic hbl , while emerges clearly during the faint phases in the case of 3c 279 , a low frequency peaked object ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we stress that the tb is relatively `` narrow '' , since its emission is mostly concentrated in the uv region , while the synchrotron emission extends from radio frequencies to the uv ( or x - rays )",
    ". then the change of relative intensity of the two components can produce strong changes of the spectral slope in the optical - uv region , where the synchrotron and tb components have very different slopes ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively ) . as a result , in the case of lbls we could find strongly negative @xmath4 values in the faint phases , namely a hardening instead of a softening of the spectrum , at wavelengths smaller but close to the peak of the tb , as observed in the case of 3c 279 , where we can estimate @xmath51 at @xmath52    on the basis of the data reported by @xcite ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "however these negative @xmath4 values do not seem to be typical in the case of our sample , although synchrotron breaks are distributed in the frequency range @xmath53 hz .",
    "thus , in principle , we can set upper limits to contribution of the accretion disk to the overall sed on the basis of the observed @xmath4 values .",
    "for a rough estimate it is sufficient to approximate the tb with a black body emission . as already noted in  1 ,",
    "although the tb itself may vary , possibly due to instabilities which produce hot spots in the accretion disk @xcite , the amplitudes of its variations are smaller than those of blazars ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "thus we can approximately consider tb emission as a constant during the much larger variations of the synchrotron component .",
    "thus we consider a specific luminosity @xmath54 of the synchrotron component with a time dependent local slope @xmath55 at the observing frequency @xmath56 , and a constant thermal tb luminosity @xmath57 with local slope @xmath58 .",
    "the total specific luminosity at two times @xmath59 and @xmath60 will be @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "the local spectral slope @xmath3 of the composite sed is : @xmath63 defining @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where the subscript `` o '' indicates the initial time , we have @xmath67 for the `` unperturbed '' synchrotron component and : @xmath68 \\bigg{/ } { \\log \\frac{\\varepsilon+\\chi}{1+\\chi}}\\ ] ] for the composite spectrum . in figure 5",
    "we report the spectral variability index @xmath4 as a function of @xmath69 for different values of the temperature @xmath70 .",
    "we assume a typical value @xmath71 and we assume for the disk a black body temperature @xmath72 or @xmath73 . in both cases",
    "we compute @xmath4 as a function of @xmath69 , for two values of @xmath74 and a typical value @xmath75 .",
    "the result is shown in figure 5 . for",
    "3c 279 we can estimate ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 which is consistent with the relevant curve in the figure .",
    "it appears that e.g. the condition @xmath79 implies @xmath80 for @xmath72 , or @xmath81 for @xmath73 .",
    "similarly @xmath82 implies @xmath83 for @xmath72 , or @xmath84 for @xmath73 . for a given @xmath85 , the ratio between tb and synchrotron components may ,",
    "in fact , vary from typical bl lacs to flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , which also show intense broad emission lines .",
    "this different behavior depends both on the intrinsic luminosity of these components and on the viewing angle .",
    "an estimate of the isotropic emission can be deduced from the broad line region luminosity @xmath86 @xcite and compared with the kinetic jet power @xcite , as done by @xcite .",
    "this information is crucial in studying the relation among different classes of objects and testing possible agn `` grand unified theories '' . in this context ,",
    "spectral variability indexes , possibly measured for stastistical samples at different time lags , luminosities , and rest - frame frequencies , will provide independent information on the relative importance of isotropic and beamed components .",
    "we have performed a new analysis of the light curves of eight bl lac objects monitored in b , v , r , i bands for a total period of about 5 years with an average sampling interval of @xmath5 days .    adopting a spectral variability index @xmath4 , representing the average ratio between the change of spectral slope and the logarithmic luminosity change , we find that bl lacs show smaller spectral variability with respect to quasars ( analyzed in a previous paper ) .",
    "this happens despite the fact that both the spectral slope and luminosity variations of bl lacs are larger then those of qsos .",
    "bl lacs and qsos appear clearly segregated in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "our analysis allows a quantitative comparison of the observations with a model based on variability of the synchrotron component .",
    "the model easily accounts for the observed position in the @xmath28 plane with a natural choice of the relevant parameters .",
    "thus the segregation in the @xmath28 plane is a consequence of the different emission mechanism in the optical band : synchrotron in the case of bl lacs and thermal hot spots on the accretion disk in the case of qsos ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a strong thermal bump can produce negative @xmath4 values , which are not observed in our sample , while they do in fact appear in some typical lbl object , where the thermal bump emerges in the faint phases .",
    "thus spectral variability , even restricted to the optical band , can be used to set limits on the relative contribution of the synchrotron component and the thermal component to the overall sed .",
    "further studies of the spectral variability index @xmath4 in different objects will allow us to establish whether the thermal bump is significant only in the most extreme lbl , or to what extent its contribution , possibly correlated with the accretion rate @xmath48 , is related to total luminosity .",
