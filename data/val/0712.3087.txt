    "the investigation of continuum and resonant states is an important subject in quantum physics . in recent years",
    ", there has been an increasing interest in the exploration of nuclear single particle states in the continuum .",
    "the construction of the radioactive ion beam facilities makes it possible to study exotic nuclei with unusual n / z ratios . in these nuclei ,",
    "the fermi surface is usually close to the particle continuum , thus the contribution of the continuum and/or resonances being essential for exotic nuclear phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it has been also revealed that the contribution of the continuum to the giant resonances mainly comes from single - particle resonant states  @xcite .    for the theoretical determination of resonant parameters ( the energy and the width ) ,",
    "several bound - state - like methods have been developed .",
    "the complex scaling method ( csm ) describes the discrete bound and resonant states on the same footing  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a complex coordinate scaling is introduced to rotate the continuum into the complex energy plane and the wave functions of resonant states , but not scattering states , are transformed into square - integrable functions  @xcite .",
    "although it involves the solution of a complex eigenvalue problem which causes some difficulties in practice , the csm has been widely and successfully used to study resonances in atomic and molecular systems  @xcite and atomic nuclei  @xcite . the analytical continuation in the coupling constant ( accc ) approach",
    "is based on an intuitive idea that a resonant state can be lowered to be bound when the potential becomes more attractive or equivalently the coupling constant stronger , thus a resonant state being related to a series of bound states via an analytical continuation in the coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "combined with the cluster model , the accc approach has been used to calculate the resonant energies and widths in some light nuclei  @xcite . an attempt to explore the unbound states by the accc approach within relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model",
    "was first made in ref .",
    "@xcite where resonant parameters of some low lying resonant states in @xmath1o and @xmath2ca obtained from the accc calculations are comparable with available data .",
    "the wave functions of nuclear resonant states were also determined by the accc method where the bound states are obtained by solving either the schrdinger equation with a woods - saxon potential  @xcite or the dirac equation with self - consistent rmf potentials  @xcite .    the real stabilization method ( rsm )",
    "is another bound - state - like method  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of the system in question is solved in a basis  @xcite or a box  @xcite of finite sizes , thus a bound state problem being always imposed .",
    "the rsm uses the fact that the energy of a `` resonant '' state is stable against changes of the sizes of the basis or the box .",
    "it has been used to calculate the resonance parameters in elastic and inelastic scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "some efforts have also been made in order to calculate more efficiently resonance parameters with the rsm  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we investigate single particle resonances in atomic nuclei by combining the rsm and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "finally we give a brief summary .",
    "the basic ansatz of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model is a lagrangian density where nucleons are described as dirac spinors which interact via the exchange of several mesons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) and the photon  @xcite , @xmath6 where the summation convention is used and the summation over @xmath7 runs over all nucleons , @xmath8 , @xmath9 the nucleon mass , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 masses and coupling constants of the respective mesons . the nonlinear self - coupling for the scalar mesons is given by  @xcite @xmath16 and field tensors for the vector mesons and the photon fields are defined as @xmath17    the classical variation principle gives equations of motion for the nucleon , mesons and the photon . as in many applications , we study the ground state properties of nuclei with time reversal symmetry , thus the nucleon spinors are the eigenvectors of the stationary dirac equation @xmath18 \\psi_i(\\bm{r } ) = \\epsilon_i \\psi_i(\\bm{r } ) , \\label{eq : dirac0}\\ ] ] and equations of motion for mesons and the photon are @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are time - like components of the vector @xmath4 and the photon fields and @xmath22 the 3-component of the time - like component of the iso - vector vector @xmath5 meson .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : dirac0 ] ) and ( [ eq : mesonmotion ] ) are coupled to each other by the vector and scalar potentials @xmath23 and various densities @xmath24    for spherical nuclei , meson fields and densities depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath25 , the dirac spinor reads @xmath26 with @xmath27 the spin spherical harmonics .",
    "the radial equation of the dirac spinor , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac0 ] ) , is reduced as @xmath28 the meson field equations become simply radial laplace equations of the form @xmath29 @xmath30 are the meson masses for @xmath31 and zero for the photon .",

    "the dirac equation ( [ eq : srhdirac ] ) is solved in a spherical box of the size @xmath36 under the box boundary condition , and thus the continuum is discretized .",
    "when @xmath36 is large enough , the energy of a bound state does not change with @xmath36 . in the continuum region , there are some states stable against the size of the box , i.e. , the energy of each of such states is almost constant with changing @xmath36 ; such stable states correspond to resonances .",
    "the resonant parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , may be obtained by fitting the energy @xmath39 and the phase shift @xmath40 in an energy range around a resonance to the following formula  @xcite , @xmath41 the phase shift @xmath42 can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath43f(r ) \\sin kr dr }            { \\int^{r_\\mathrm{max}}_0 \\chi_l(r ) \\left[e - h(r)\\right]f(r ) \\cos kr dr }   ,   \\label{eq : eta1}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 when @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : eta1 ] ) converges very slowly with the box size due to the influence of the non zero centrifugal potential at large @xmath48  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we use a simpler method proposed by maier et al .",
    "@xcite in which it s not necessary to calculate the phase shift .",
    "the resonance energy is determined by the condition @xmath49 = 0 and the corresponding box size is labeled as @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the width is evaluated from the stability behavior of the positive energy state against the box size around @xmath52 .    when @xmath25 is large enough , the nuclear potentials @xmath35 and @xmath34 vanish , @xmath53 satisfy @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the general solution reads @xmath56 ,   \\label{eq : scattering}\\ ] ] when @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "therefore when @xmath36 is large enough , @xmath59 under the assumption that the phase shift from the potential scattering @xmath60 varies slowly with respect to the box size , i.e , @xmath61 , one derives from eqs .  ( [ eq : e - eta ] ) and ( [ eq : node ] ) the formula , @xmath62^{-1 } }   \\label{eq : gamma }   .\\ ] ] in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath63 , eq .  ( [ eq : gamma ] )",
