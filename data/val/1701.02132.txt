    "the emission of radio frequency ( rf ) radiation from the extended air showers ( eas ) produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr , i.e. , particles with energy @xmath0ev ) impinging on the earth atmosphere has been investigated since the 60s , after askaryan @xcite proposed a coherent mechanism for the production of cherenkov radiation at mhz frequencies ( the so called askaryan effect ) . the first detection of rf radiation from eas was proved in 1965 by jelley et al . @xcite .",
    "the idea of askaryan relies on the excess of negative charges in the shower , since positrons tend to disappear through their annihilation into photons , and further electrons are created via compton scattering by photons .",
    "if the number of electrons and positrons is the same , emission would not occur because the electric field generated by opposite charges is equal ( in module ) and opposite ( in sign ) . upon certain conditions",
    ", the cherenkov yield is not proportional to the number @xmath1 of charged particles in the shower , but to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fractional excess of charge .",
    "the quadratic dependence on @xmath1 ( and therefore on @xmath4 ) makes the askaryan effect attractive as mechanism for the detection of uhecrs .    in the following years",
    ", other mechanisms were proposed , which predict a coherent emission of rf radiation , and invoke the interaction of the shower electrons and positrons with the earth magnetic field .",
    "negative and positive charges are separated by the magnetic field , creating an electric dipole . during the motion of the dipole ,",
    "rf radiation is emitted in coherent way ( geomagnetic effect ) .",
    "alternatively , charged particles are bent because of the lorentz force and emit synchrotron radiation ( geosynchrotron effect ) .",
    "the bunch of particles in the eas arriving to the detector can be schematically depicted as a dish , with thickness @xmath5 of a few meters and diameter depending of the energy of the primary .",
    "as will see in the followings , the requirement that the wavelength @xmath6 is comparable with the dish thickness puts a frequency cutoff above which coherence is lost ( and , consequently , the emission strongly hampered ) : @xmath7  mhz , where @xmath8 is the speed of light .",
    "the coherence condition explains why the experimental investigation is mostly concentrated in the frequency range @xmath9  mhz .",
    "this picture is not complete .",
    "only very recently , it has been shown , with monte carlo simulations @xcite , that geosynchrotron radiation can be coherent above @xmath10100  mhz under certain conditions : since the emission occurs in air , which has a ( altitude dependent ) refractive index @xmath11 , a time compression of rf wavefront is produced , which causes the coherence to extend to higher frequency , even beyond the ghz .",
    "the compression takes place only inside a cone with aperture @xmath12 equal to the cherenkov angle , and angular spread @xmath13 . outside this small angular region ,",
    "coherence is lost and the rf output power falls dramatically .",
    "in this coherence regime , sometimes named ",
    "geomagnetic cherenkov radiation \" , the emitted electric field amplitude @xmath14 depends on the frequency and can be modelled , as shown by refs .",
    ", as @xmath15 with @xmath16 300  mhz and @xmath17 500  mhz . here we will not deal with such particular mechanism .",
    "the first experimental proof of the coherent cherenkov emission in laboratory controlled conditions was performed in 2001 by directing picosecond pulses of gev photons against a silica sand target @xcite . successively other tests were conducted using rock salt @xcite or ice @xcite as targets . because of the higher density of those materials , the shower dimensions are different than in air , and askaryan effect can extend beyond ghz frequencies .",
    "the coherent rf emission by charged particles in the presence of a magnetic field has been measured in controlled conditions and successfully checked versus electrodynamics simulations in ref . .",
    "beside coherent emission , a rf incoherent emission mechanism exists , that is , bremsstralhung radiation , the emission of photons during the deflection of electrons and positrons under the coulomb field of the nuclei .",
    "the emission is always present but is weak since it scales linearly with @xmath4 and the cross section is low .    in this paper we do not discuss the various mechanisms of production of rf radiation and their relative importance .",
    "our purpose is to explicitly show how and when coherent mechanisms appear , and to derive a general formula which involves the coherent and the incoherent regimes .",
    "we suppose that the eas is composed by @xmath1 charged particles divided into @xmath18 electrons and @xmath19 positrons ( @xmath20 ) , and indicate with @xmath3 the charge excess : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "depending of the rf radiation mechanism , the phase of the electromagnetic wave from a single emitter ( electron or positron ) can change randomly with time or can not . for bremsstrahlung , for example ,",
    "the phase changes randomly and therefore the superposition of @xmath1 sources is incoherent and the emitted energy is proportional to @xmath1 . for synchrotron , geomagnetic , and cherenkov emission the phase of a single emitter does not change randomly with time .",
    "the superposition of @xmath1 emitters can be coherent or incoherent depending on the random relative position of the individual sources .    to simplify the calculations",
    ", we suppose that the electric field amplitude is unity and the fields are polarized in the same direction .    for the case of cherenkov radiation , the electron and positron electric fields have opposite sign .",
    "therefore the total electric field @xmath14 ( at the detector ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the phases of the rf wave emitted by the @xmath26-th electron and positron , respectively . for any @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath24",
    "are independent random variables with the same distribution @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28",
    ". therefore their mean values , for any @xmath26 , are @xmath29 .",
    "the energy @xmath30 is @xmath31 we are interested to the mean value @xmath32 : @xmath33 since @xmath24 is independent of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 = @xmath37 = @xmath38 = @xmath39 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the probability density @xmath40 is an even function between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so @xmath43 . in conclusion",
    ", @xmath44 analogously @xmath45 @xmath46 the energy @xmath47 is therefore @xmath48\\mean{\\cos\\phi}^2\\ ] ]    the factor which determines the presence of the coherence is precisely @xmath49 .",
    "it can be easily seen in the case where the phases @xmath50 are uniformly distributed between @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath51 two extreme regimes can be identified :    1 .",
    "@xmath52 : @xmath53 , which is the condition for complete incoherence .",
    "the total energy is @xmath54 .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the optical and uv cherenkov light emission .",
    "@xmath55 : total coherence .",
    "@xmath56 , depends on the excess @xmath3 of negative charges in the shower .",
    "the cherenkov angle . ]    .",
    "[ fg : systemref ]    we treat now the generic case for the cherenkov radiation where the phase @xmath50 is not uniformely distributed .",
    "the results can be easily adapted to the geosynchronous and the geomagnetic radiation . with reference to fig.[fg : systemref ] , we introduce a reference system with versors @xmath57 , where the eas axis coincides the @xmath58 axis .",
    "@xmath59 is a single emitter with cylindrical coordinates @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the cherenkov cone aperture , @xmath62 the angular coordinate along the emission cone .",
    "the detector d is placed on the axis @xmath58 at the distance @xmath63 : @xmath64 .",
    "p is the projection of s on the x - y plane .",
    "then : @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath67 is @xmath68 and the phase @xmath50 of the electric field in the point d is @xmath69\\ ] ] the phase @xmath50 depends also on @xmath63 ( fixed value ) , but since in the calculation of the energy only the phase differences enter , the term with @xmath63 always eliminates , so we can put @xmath70 to simplify the computation : @xmath71\\ ] ] we schematize the shower as a flat cylinder , with thickness @xmath5 and charge distribution @xmath72 along the shower axis ( @xmath73 ) , and radial charge distribution @xmath74 such as @xmath75 = 1 .",
    "the angular variables @xmath76 and @xmath62 are distributed uniformily between 0 and @xmath77",
    ". then @xmath78\\big]\\ ] ] the computation is straightforward in the case @xmath79 ( uniform distribution ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "calling : @xmath82 and @xmath83 then @xmath84    the same procedure can be applied to the geosynchrotron emission .",
    "the electric field of the synchrotron radiation is @xcite : @xmath85}{r~(1-\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\hat{n})^3 } \\bigg]_{retarded}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the versor of the direction of observation , @xmath87 is the particle acceleration , and the electron electric charge @xmath88 must be considered with the sign . since positrons and electrons have opposite acceleration under magnetic field , the product @xmath89 is the same for the two particles , so the electric fields sum up .",
    "therefore , for geosynchrotron radiation , the eq.([eq : efield ] ) becomes @xmath90 and the final result is : @xmath91\\mean{\\cos\\phi}^2\\ ] ] in case of total coherence , @xmath92 .",
    "( [ eq : wmedio ] ) and ( [ eq : wmedio2 ] ) can be summarized stating that the total power emitted by @xmath1 sources is obtained multiplying the power from a single source by a factor @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the spatial coherence factor , function of the radiation frequency @xmath96 and of the shower shape and dimension , and the sign @xmath97 depends on the emission mechanism (  for cherenkov , + for synchrotron and geomagnetic ) .",
    "the factor @xmath98 in eq.([eq : m ] ) determines the coherent or incoherent regime . if @xmath99 , the incoherence is total , and @xmath100 , i.e. the total emitted power is the some of the @xmath1 single powers . on the opposite",
    ", complete coherence occurs as @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for cherenkov emission , @xmath103 for geosynchrotron and geomagnetic emission , i.e. , the power is proportional to the squared number of emitters .",
    "the factorization ( @xmath104 ) has the physical meaning that the longitudinal and radial developments of the showers are independent of each other , which is a reasonable approximation that can be extended to the general case .",
    "@xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , takes into account the radial emitter distribution @xmath74 , in the plane perpendicular to the shower axis , while @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) takes into account the distribution along the longitudinal axis .    as a check ,",
    "note that when @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( total spatial incoherence ) and when @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( total spatial coherence ) .",
    "as an example of the above calculations , we apply them to the case of eas produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .    it is well known that a relativistic particle with velocity @xmath115 such that @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the refractive index of air , radiates electromagnetic waves at the angle @xmath118 at the energy rate ( in si units ) : @xmath119 since @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , for an eas with @xmath1 secondary particles the radiated power @xmath123 in the bandwidth @xmath124 centred around the frequency @xmath96 , neglecting coherence effets , is : @xmath125     for the coherent cherenkov effect assuming the nkg radial charge distribution . ]    where @xmath126 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath127 the planck constant .",
    "when coherence occurs , the emitted power is obtained from the above equation substituting the factor @xmath1 with @xmath2 and taking into consideration the amplitude @xmath98 ( eq.([eq : m ] ) ) .",
    "then @xmath128 to calculate @xmath129 from eq.([eq : ar ] ) we must know the radial charge distribution @xmath130 .",
    "some examples can be found in the original work of askaryan @xcite .",
    "here we treat the case of the nishima , kamata , greisen ( nkg ) distribution , which describes adequately the charge distribution in an eas@xcite .",
    "the normalized density function @xmath74 is : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the factorial gamma function , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 m. @xmath135 has been evaluated numerically and the result shown in fig.[fg : fignkg ] .",
    "the frequency cutoff , where the power is reduced by a factor of 2 , is @xmath136 mhz .    regarding the longitudinal coherence , in the simple case of an uniform charge distribution , we get , as shown before in eq.([eq : az ] ) , a @xmath137 function with the first zero occurring at @xmath138 mhz for @xmath139 m. beyond that frequency , the rf emitted power scales as @xmath140 .",
    "more realistic cases are discussed in ref .  .",
    "we have derived a general formula for the emission of radio frequency from particle showers , which describes also the transition from the incoherent regime to the coherent one .",
    "a coherence factor is introduced , which depends on the spatial charge distribution of the radio frequency emitters .",
    "the formula applies also to dense materials , such as ice , for example , which has been proposed as target medium ( precisely , antartic ice sheet ) the for the detection of very high energy neutrinos @xcite ."
