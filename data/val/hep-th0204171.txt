    "the notion of a bound state of fermions is based mainly on the examples of atoms and nuclei .",
    "the common feature of these systems is that they are non - relativistic .",
    "this means three things .",
    "kinetic energies of the fermions are small in comparison to their rest mass energy .",
    "dominant interactions are not able to produce fast moving fermions from the slow ones and hence no significant large - momentum spin effects are generated .",
    "creation of additional particles can be neglected and one can describe the bound states as built from a fixed number of fermion constituents .",
    "these features are all related to the fact that the domain of large relative momenta is not important , which is easiest to describe in mathematical terms in the case of bound states of two fermions , such as positronium or deuteron .",
    "their wave functions are self - consistent solutions to the non - relativistic schrdinger equation @xmath0 with hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the kinetic energy operator and @xmath3 stands for the interaction operator .",
    "the matrix element @xmath4 is the quantum coulomb , or yukawa potential with a repulsive core , respectively .",
    "the ket @xmath5 denotes a state of two fermions labeled 1 and 2 , with all their quantum numbers collectively denoted by these labels .",
    "the self - consistency of this well known picture means that the wave function @xmath6 quickly vanishes when the relative momentum of fermions in the bound - state rest frame of reference , @xmath7 , approaches values comparable with the fermions reduced mass @xmath8 ( the speed of light , @xmath9 ) .",
    "the success of the schrdinger picture for bound states of fermions extends also to quarks .",
    "this is reflected in the constituent quark model ( cqm ) being the primary means for classification of hadrons in the particle data tables , and providing a benchmark for more advanced approaches .",
    "however , the self - consistency of the non - relativistic picture is much harder to maintain for bound states of quarks up , down , and strange , than for systems such as positronium and deuteron .",
    "this is because the hadronic wave functions tend to have considerable components with @xmath10 comparable to or exceeding @xmath8 for the quarks , and the domain of large relative momenta begins to play a significant role in the binding mechanism .",
    "one is also interested in the description of hadrons moving with speeds very close to the speed of light .",
    "since the fast moving hadrons and their interactions can not be consistently described within a purely non - relativistic schrdinger framework , theorists use the feynman parton model in that case .",
    "unfortunately , the binding mechanism of partons is far beyond the scope of the parton model .",
    "as alternative to these models , one can approach the issue of bound states of fermions using quantum field theory ( qft ) , where the corresponding operator @xmath11 appears to contain all the relevant information about relativistic effects in the domain of large relative momenta of the constituents .",
    "however , the relativistic description of bound states of fermions in qft , especially in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the case of light quarks , makes the conceptual difficulties with the constituent picture even greater than in the simple models . in the equation @xmath12",
    ", all factors remain unknown .",
    "major reasons for this status of the theory originate in the large relative momentum domain in the motion of virtual particles .",
    "this is illustrated by the following examples .",
    "one is that local qfts lead to canonical interaction hamiltonians @xmath3 that change individual bare particle energies by unlimited amounts ( spin - dependent factors grow with momentum transfers ) .",
    "the large momentum range is enhanced and leads to divergences , invalidating the concept of a non - relativistic picture entirely unless special conditions , such as an extraordinarily small coupling , are met .",
    "another example is that the interactions create new bare particles and this effect contributes to the boosting of bound states , which implies that the motion of bound states is associated with multi - particle components and the _ ad hoc _ limitation to a fixed number of bare constituents goes out the window in relativistic qfts .",
    "a third example is that even the state with no constituent particles , i.e. the ground state of a theory , or vacuum , proves to be so complicated that no approximate solution of verifiable accuracy has been conceived yet , although many ansatzes have to be and are employed in practical attempts . in these circumstances , the main theoretical approach to bound states of quarks ( mainly heavy ones that move slowly )",
    "is based on the lattice version of qcd , and great progress has been achieved in numerical studies of the theory that way .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that a quantitative explanation of how the constituent picture with a simple hamiltonian could be an approximate solution , remains a conceptual and quantitative mystery .",
    "no detailed constituent wave function picture for relativistic field quanta in minkovsky space has been theoretically identified or is expected to readily follow from the lattice approach alone .",
    "the question of convergence of the binding mechanisms in the domain of large relative momenta of constituent particles , remains open .",
    "this article provides some numerical arguments that the required constituent picture with well - controlled large relative momentum domain may become in principle identifiable if one provides a precise definition of the constituents as effective particles , in distinction from the bare quanta of the local theory .",
    "thus , the process of solving a theory is arranged in two steps , which is typical in lattice approach @xcite , or sum rules @xcite .",
    "in the first step , one derives an effective dynamics , and , in the second step , one attempts to solve the effective theory instead of dealing directly with the original degrees of freedom . here",
    ", one derives the effective fermions of size @xmath13 using a suitable boost - invariant perturbative renormalization group procedure for their hamiltonians .",
    "the procedure is carried out up to second - order perturbation theory , and the resulting dynamics is compared with the standard picture , where the finite scale @xmath14 is absent . in distinction from the diverging bare dynamics , the effective one comes out limited to the momentum range given by @xmath14 , and this scale is reduced using differential equations to the most suitable one for description of bound state properties in terms of a fixed number of the corresponding constituents . in the renormalized hamiltonian picture ,",
    "the point - like bare particles of the local theory correspond to @xmath15 and",
    "their dynamics heavily involves large momenta , and multi - particle states , for any finite value of the coupling constant .",
    "however , the situation is completely changed when @xmath14 is lowered to values comparable to the bound state masses .",
    "the binding is described by a new schrdinger equation , @xmath16 , where the hamiltonian , @xmath17 , is written in terms of creation and annihilation operators for the effective particles , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for fermions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for anti - fermions ( and @xmath22 and @xmath23 for bosons ) .",
    "this effective particle picture is discussed in the present paper .",
    "the key physical reasons for the hope that the effective constituent picture does emerge from qft can be understood by recalling again what happens in the well - known cases of atoms ( or positronium ) and nuclei ( or deuteron ) discussed above .",
    "these systems can be understood in terms of constituents for quite different reasons .",
    "the explanation of the difference is limited below to the positronium and deuteron , but the two examples are sufficient to make the point that concerns all bound systems of fermions in qft . in the schrdinger quantum - mechanical picture of positronium ,",
    "the coupling constant that appears in the coulomb potential is very small in comparison to 1 , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the interaction produces quite small binding energy , of order @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 bound - state mass is dominated by @xmath27 .",
    "the relative - motion wave function is proportional to @xmath28 , independently of the fermion spins .",
    "when one extends this picture by embedding it in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , one finds out that the initial wave function is so small for large momenta @xmath29 , that no significant correction is able to emerge from that region and alter the original picture with the coulomb potential .",
    "this is found by expanding the theory term by term in powers of @xmath30 around the initial schrdinger picture .",
    "the interaction linear in @xmath30 ( coulomb force ) is sufficient to describe the main features of fermionic bound states in qed , and higher powers of @xmath30 are not important for theoretical understanding of the bulk of the bound state structure .",
    "although the integrals in the corrections run over the momentum range that formally extends far beyond @xmath8 , the coupling constant is too small for the relativistic fermion spin factors and particle creation processes to produce any major modifications of the leading approximation .",
    "this feature will be farther discussed in the next sections .    in the meson - exchange models of the deuteron binding mechanism ,",
    "the analogous coupling constant is three orders of magnitude larger than in qed .",
    "if one attempted to use qft to derive the yukawa potential using the same strategy as in qed , and to calculate corrections , the perturbative procedure would fail .",
    "the interactions would accelerate nucleons to the speed of light almost immediately on the bound - state formation time - scale , many new particles would be created , and the large momentum relativistic `` corrections '' would dominate the `` leading '' non - relativistic terms .",
    "one could then ask why the famous one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potentials , such as the yukawa potential with a core , could still be used in phenomenology of relativistic nuclear physics and work self - consistently in the nuclear bound - state equations anyway . what saves the picture of a fixed number of relatively slow nucleons interacting through exchange of mesons from serious inconsistency when one includes the elements of qft ,",
    "is that the interactions responsible for emission and absorption of mesons by nucleons contain form factors that limit momentum transfers to values so small that the interactions are effectively weak , much weaker than a change of @xmath30 in qed by the factor 1000 would imply .",
    "consequently , the binding energy is much smaller than the sum of two nucleon masses , e.g. about 2.2 mev for deuteron .",
    "the wave functions of such generalized relativistic nuclear physics picture are not overwhelmingly extending into the large - relative - momentum domain because the form factors eliminate coupling to that region and the non - relativistic yukawa potential with a repulsive core is not invalidated by huge corrections .",
    "it could not be so with bare point - like fermions in local qft , but it does work in the phenomenological picture of effective particles with the form factors . by the way , this example is not intended to suggest that nucleon dynamics should be completely derivable directly from a local qft that ignores the existence of quarks .",
    "in fact , a scenario for how to derive the effective nuclear physics picture from qcd will be discussed in the last section of this work .",
    "nevertheless , the nuclear physics picture does indicate that an effective particle dynamics may involve large coupling constants in potentials that resemble perturbative second - order interactions with form factors .",
    "in qcd , none of the two schemes can apply separately . on the one hand",
    ", the effective coupling constant in the constituent qcd picture can not be as small as in qed , because qcd is characterized by asymptotic freedom , or infrared slavery .",
    "this means that the effective coupling strength is expected to grow when the scale of relevant momentum transfers decreases .",
    "the coupling constant is already on the order of 0.1 at transfers on the order of 100 gev and it may be much larger for transfers on the order of nucleon masses .",
    "therefore , the effects that have marginal size in the eigenvalue problem for approximate @xmath31 , such as spin splittings , are expected to be much larger and more important for understanding eigenstates of @xmath32 , and the initial approximation is not as simple as in qed . on the other hand , one can not freely insert form factors into the local lagrangian for quark and gluon fields because it would spoil the local gauge symmetry structure .",
    "the contact with qcd would be irreversibly lost .",
    "the situation is changed when qft is approached using the idea of similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians @xcite , especially in the case of qcd @xcite , and when one combines the similarity idea with the concept of form factors in the hamiltonian interaction vertices for effective particles @xcite .",
    "initially , the coupling constant is small due to asymptotic freedom and one can think of using the small coupling constant in canonical qft to solve the renormalization group equations for @xmath33 using a perturbative expansion .",
    "the method avoids small energy denominators in the perturbative calculation entirely and the non - perturbative part of the dynamics remains untouched in the perturbative calculation of @xmath33 .",
    "that way one derives effective - particle hamiltonians that involve vertex form factors of small width @xmath14 in the interaction terms .",
    "one can have sizable couplings in @xmath33 with small @xmath14 , as required by infrared slavery , without losing control over the size of corrections to the leading constituent picture in diagonalizing @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrum of such hamiltonians can be sought numerically because the form factors limit the range of momenta strongly enough for a discrete computer code to cover the pertinent region , as in the nuclear physics case discussed above .",
    "this idea has already been studied qualitatively in a simple numerical matrix model @xcite using wegner s flow equation @xcite ( and its generalizations ) .",
    "the more detailed effective particle calculus used in the present work in the case of yukawa theory , is already known to produce asymptotic freedom in @xmath33 for qcd @xcite .",
    "the new approach has been also extended to the whole poincar algebra @xcite in qft .",
    "the present paper provides elementary numerical estimates of the orders of magnitude of the interactions that appear in qft in the bound state dynamics of two effective fermions of size @xmath13 .",
    "yukawa theory is used to avoid complications related to gauge symmetry while one still preserves some of the singular large - momentum components in the spinor factors that characterize fermions .",
    "the well - known issue of triviality in yukawa theory is irrelevant here since our goal is to estimate the size of corrections in the bound - state dynamics in an effective theory , rather than in the ultra - violet ( uv ) dynamics of the initial qft .",
    "the yukawa example serves only as a source of typical uv factors that qfts provide anyway , no matter if the theory is trivial , asymptotically free , or otherwise .",
    "the key qualitative question is by how much the hamiltonian @xmath33 derived in qft might differ from familiar models , especially from the non - relativistic schrdinger picture with a yukawa potential ( or a coulomb potential in the case of exchange of massless mesons ) , for given values of @xmath30 and @xmath14 .",
    "another question is related to the fact that the exact solution of renormalization group equations for @xmath33 and subsequent exact diagonalization of @xmath33 should lead to spectra that are independent of @xmath14 .",
    "however , when one calculates @xmath33 in perturbation theory of low order , such as the second order that characterizes the coulomb and yukawa potentials , the @xmath14-dependence must appear .",
    "bound - state energies may depend on @xmath14 when @xmath14 is made too small or @xmath30 is made too large .",
    "the question is how large is the residual @xmath14 dependence of second - order corrections to the coulomb - like picture in how large a range of values of @xmath30 and @xmath14 that can be self - consistently ( i.e. , without significant @xmath14-dependence ) reached in lowest orders of perturbation theory , for @xmath33 itself in the renormalization group part of the calculation , and for the eigenvalues and wave functions in the bound state perturbation theory around the coulomb - like ansatz .",
    "both questions are answered in the next sections by estimating the size of those corrections that are most important for large momenta , and which would lead to divergences in the absence of @xmath14 .",
    "the results imply that the most dangerous corrections that might diverge in the absence of @xmath14 , turn out to be quite small even for sizable coupling constants .",
    "this provides some initial ground for the hope that the effective particle dynamics can be attempted numerically in qcd in the same way .",
    "an outline of how the same approach , if successful , could then in principle also lead from effective @xmath34 to the effective meson - exchange interactions between nucleons in nuclear physics , is also provided",
    ".    many farther dynamical issues of great interest , concerning effective fermions and their binding in qft , can be posed and investigated using the effective particle calculus , but none are studied here in detail . for example , the case of phonon exchange between electrons as approximated by a qft is not discussed here @xcite , and symmetry restoration issues in not - explicitly symmetric hamiltonian approach through coupling coherence @xcite is also not considered . instead , this work is focused on the readily accessible quantitative estimates that show the magnitude of the difference between the convergent two - effective fermions bound - state dynamics and the diverging dynamics of two bare fermions in the approaches based on the tamm - dancoff truncation in local qft @xcite .",
    "in fact , this paper starts with the tamm - dancoff - like approach to local theory , because it is more familiar .",
    "then , the effective particle approach is introduced , with its new features exposed through the contrast with the tamm - dancoff one .",
    "thus , section [ sec : def ] provides definitions of the renormalized tamm - dancoff scheme in subsection [ sub : rtda ] , and the effective particle scheme in subsection [ sub : repa ] .",
    "both approaches involve a universal procedure for obtaining a two - fermion eigenvalue equation that can be compared with the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "this universal procedure is for brevity called _ reduction_. it is denoted by the symbol @xmath35 and described in subsection [ sub : r ] .",
    "section [ sec : can ] introduces a bare light - front hamiltonian in yukawa quantum field theory that serves as a starting point for subsequent sections .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian is supplied with some regularization factors @xmath36 and counterterms .",
    "section [ sec : a1 ] describes details of the approach that treats bound states of fermions as if they could be viewed as made of two bare fermions .",
    "this approach is shortly called _ approach 1 _ and encounters large - momentum conceptual and calculational difficulties that are removed by switching over to the approach discussed in detail in section [ sec : a2 ] .",
    "namely , section [ sec : a2 ] presents the effective fermion approach , called _ approach 2 _ , using comparison and contrast with the approach 1 . in the approach 2 ,",
    "bound states of fermions are treated as built from effective fermions of size @xmath13 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "appendixes contain information about the operation @xmath35 , spinor factors , momentum variables , and a coulomb bound state wave function used in the calculations .",
    "this section provides definitions of two light - front hamiltonian approaches to the bound state dynamics , the renormalized tamm - dancoff approach ( approach 1 ) , and effective particle approach ( approach 2 ) .",
    "they are compared through numerical estimates in next sections in the case of a bound state of two fermions .",
    "the procedure of reducing a theory to the two - fermion sector is mathematically the same in both cases , except for a different definition of what is meant by the two - fermion states . in the approach 1 , the starting point will be identical with bare fermions in qft , in the approach 2 it will be the effective ones .",
    "the reduction procedure , denoted by @xmath35 , is described at the end of this section for both approaches simultaneously .",
    "this approach is represented by the following diagram , @xmath37    _ 0 ) _ the initial step on the left denotes a canonical derivation of a field theory hamiltonian from its lagrangian , quantization , and normal ordering with respect to the bare vacuum state , dropping all diverging terms on the basis of hindsight knowledge that the normal ordered hamiltonian will eventually contain counterterms of the same structure , but well defined .    _",
    "i ) _ the next step is called regularization , which is necessary because the canonical hamiltonian leads to ultraviolet divergences due to the infinite range of energy scales to sum over in the intermediate states when one calculates physical observables ( such as scattering cross - section ) using perturbative formulae .",
    "one imposes an ultraviolet cutoff ( we denote it by @xmath38 ) on the range of momenta that are included in the sums .",
    "observables calculated with such regularized hamiltonian explicitly depend on both the parameter @xmath38 , and on the way the regularization is imposed .",
    "for example , the regularization may preserve or violate some symmetries - an oblate cutoff function would not be rotationally symmetric , or a frame - dependent cutoff would not respect lorentz symmetry , and finite corrections due to such regularizations would be required . to remove the artificial dependence of observables on regularization , one has to add new terms to the hamiltonian ( called counterterms and denoted @xmath39 ) that also depend on the regularization .",
    "the construction of counterterms is based on the idea of recovering the contribution from dynamics above the cutoff , which is to lead to finite and cutoff independent results when @xmath40 .",
    "the counterterms structure is thus determined by the structure of divergences .",
    "the latter can be computed and @xmath39 is than adjusted to cancel the cutoff dependence .",
    "it is less straightforward to remove finite effects of regularization , but this issue will not be important in the next sections .",
    "the regularized hamiltonian @xmath41 is denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "_ ii ) _ the last arrow indicates solving of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath42 .",
    "a two - steps procedure is used .    _ step a ) _",
    "first one finds eigenstates of @xmath43 whose dominant component for vanishingly small coupling constants is equal to one bare fermion .",
    "these states represent what one could call a physical fermion .",
    "the solution is found from the eigenvalue equation for the whole @xmath42 by reducing that equation with the help of operation @xmath35 to an equivalent equation for the fock component with one bare fermion .",
    "if one requires the eigenvalue to be finite , one has to include in @xmath39 a mass counterterm of a calculable form .",
    "_ step b ) _ then , one makes a reduction @xmath35 of the eigenvalue problem for @xmath43 to a two - bare - fermion subspace , to find an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath42 that is dominated by a pair of bare fermions for infinitesimally small coupling constants .",
    "the parameters in the resulting two - fermion eigenvalue problem are expressed in terms of the physical fermion mass found in step _ a ) _ above .",
    "it turns out that the calculated eigenvalues still depend on the cutoff ( some diverge if @xmath44 ) , although the individual matrix elements of the reduced two - body hamiltonian do not depend on the cutoffs once one includes mass counterterms calculated in _ ii a _ ) .",
    "therefore , there is a problem of how to construct counterterms that would remove @xmath38 dependence from physical results @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention here an alternative approach , which is also inspired by the tamm - dancoff truncation but includes renormalization group idea in a more sensible way @xcite .",
    "namely , one can assume that some effective fermion representation of the eigenstates of @xmath42 does exist .",
    "one tries then to build a triangle of renormalization ( the notion of the triangle in the case of similarity renormalization group scheme for light - front hamiltonians can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for a sequence of calculations with growing cutoffs @xmath45 and growing numbers of fermions and bosons , adjusting counterterms to the momentum cutoffs differently in different fock sectors . the hope is to understand regularities in the obtained structures that produce stable outputs when the momentum cutoffs and the particle numbers are made so large in the triangle that one can follow the renormalization group flow down from the large values and recognize interactions that have a universal character . moving then along the renormalized hamiltonian trajectory in the triangle",
    ", one would be able to arrive at the desired effective particle picture .",
    "one of the key tools one would use in studying the triangle would be the coupling coherence @xcite that requires that the interactions retain their forms when one moves around the triangle with large values of the cutoffs .",
    "this approach is thus relying on regularities that need to be discovered in a vast amount of intricate analytic and numerical data .",
    "the data can also be interpreted with the help of perturbative techniques wherever possible . as a variation of this idea , one may even attempt to include new degrees of freedom , such as pauli - villars pseudo - particles , and treat them as a suitable way of writing down required counterterms @xcite .",
    "however , the latter strategy faces a problem of sending the regulator masses to infinity ( it is not clear how to do it using computers ) or living with the additional degrees of freedom that are absent in the initial theory .",
    "one also uses discretization of the longitudinal light - front momenta ( usually denoted by @xmath46 ) @xcite , which limits the number of constituents .",
    "however , the transverse dynamics is not smoothed out that way and poses the same divergence problems .",
    "the initially helpful longitudinal cutoff has to be relaxed in order to recover boost invariance . at that stage ,",
    "the same problems reappear fully again and remain unsolved .",
    "thus , the already known options for general searches for effective fermion dynamics are hard to pursue .",
    "in contrast , in the present article , it is taken for granted that one can assume from the very beginning a large degree of rigidity in the derivartion of effective theory by writing it in terms of creation and annihilation operators for effective particles .",
    "the assumption allows one to narrow the search for effective dynamics using a unitary renormalization group procedure @xcite , which is the basis for the approach 2 introduced below .",
    "the procedure consists of three steps that are described later in detail in section [ sec : eff ] , and can be represented by the following diagram . @xmath47",
    "the steps _ 0 ) _ and _ i ) _ are the same as before except that one works with the bare creation and annihilation operators for efficient book - keeping for hamiltonian terms at all times , instead of storing a huge number of selected matrix elements of @xmath42 . note that many other operators could have the same selected matrix elements . also , matrix elements of operators change when the basis states change even if the operators remain unchanged , and the same operator may have different matrix elements when different states are used to represent constituent particles .    _",
    "ii ) _ this step , marked with @xmath48 in the diagram , is made using the procedure of renormalization group for effective particles ( rgep ) @xcite .",
    "the procedure is defined as a unitary rotation of creation and annihilation operators by an operator @xmath49 .",
    "hamiltonians @xmath50 are expressed in terms of the effective - particle creation and annihilation operators that depend on the `` width '' parameter @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath51  ranges from @xmath52 in @xmath42 to a finite value on the order of bound - state masses in the effective constituent dynamics . that such small scales can in principle be reached using perturbation theory @xcite ,",
    "is possible because rgep procedure is designed according to the rules of the similarity renormalization group for hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "it separates the perturbative from non - perturbative aspects of the theory ( see the original articles ) . by the same design ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath50 can not change invariant masses of effective - particle fock states by more than about @xmath51 in a single interaction .",
    "and @xmath50 is that the latter is for effective particles of size @xmath53 , instead of the point - like bare ones that the former is for , and interaction terms in @xmath50 are limited by form factors @xmath54 .",
    "the form factors are marked in figures by a black blob.,width=226 ]    thus , the emission of effective bosons by effective fermions is possible only if the associated kinetic energy change of relative motion of the particles does not exceed @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , when @xmath51 is small , fock sectors with different numbers of effective particles are coupled weakly even for sizable coupling constants , like in the nuclear physics example discussed in the introduction .",
    "_ iii ) _ this step is analogous to the step _",
    "ii ) _ in the approach 1 and amounts to solving the eigenvalue problem for effective hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "the key difference , however , is that when one works using the basis of effective particles in the fock space , states with two effective fermions couple only to states with similar relative momenta .",
    "therefore , the large relative momentum domain remains suppressed , and it can be described using perturbation theory without assuming that the coupling constant is very small .",
    "thus , when one solves the eigenvalue equation for @xmath33 , one can introduce a new perturbation theory for the reduction operator @xmath35 , expanding in powers of @xmath55 .",
    "this gives an equivalent hamiltonian that acts only in the dominant fock space sectors .",
    "there are two steps to do , as in the approach 1 .    in the _ step a )",
    "_ , one first considers eigenstates dominated by one effective fermion , which defines a physical mass of a physical fermion in the approach 2 .",
    "then , in the _ step b ) _ , one finds an equation describing bound states of two effective particles . the parameter @xmath51 is a key to the procedure .",
    "its value determines whether derivation of the effective hamiltonian @xmath50 and its reduction by the operation @xmath35 to a model subspace hamiltonian , denoted by @xmath56 , is possible in perturbation theory .",
    "the smaller is @xmath51 the simpler are the approximate solutions for bound states of effective fermions , in the sense that they tend to reduce to the dominant effective fock sector .",
    "but if @xmath51 is too small , the step _",
    "ii ) _ of derivation of @xmath50 in perturbation theory loses accuracy ( the perturbative integration of renormalization group equations begins to significantly cut into the bound - state dynamics ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 can not be lowered too far using perturbation theory for @xmath33 .",
    "the optimal choice of @xmath51 is the one that combines the simplest perturbative expansion for @xmath50 with least complicated computer diagonalization of @xmath50 .",
    "the main criterion for choosing the right range for @xmath14 is that the calculated observables are not sensitive to variation of @xmath51 over that range .",
    "the final comment concerns refs .",
    "@xcite , where a different concept of a bound state calculus has been developed using coupling coherence in second - order perturbation theory for hamiltonian matrix elements , also in the similarity scheme but without the constraint to a boost - invariant unitary rotation of creation and annihilation operators ( from the bare to effective ones ) . in distinction from these works , the approach 2 is not based on the coupling coherence because no coherent structure is known _ a priori _ in the region of small @xmath51 , far from the initial canonical structure . instead",
    ", one uses a perturbative expansion for the effective - particle renormalization group flow in terms of a suitably defined coupling constant and tries to find out the relevant structures in a prescribed basis , in which the expansion in powers of the coupling constant may be extrapolable to its physical values . here , the analysis of yukawa theory is limited to numerical estimates of the size of only a few important terms of first and second order in a bound - state perturbation theory , which goes beyond the renormalization group flow . in the flow itself",

    "also , strong @xmath51-dependence suggests that considerable errors can come from the limitation to only second - order perturbative calculation of the similarity rotation . besides",

    "the fact found here that in the yukawa theory one could enhance the coupling constant even up to 0.3 or 0.6 and the constituent picture remained convergent in the large - relative momentum region , is encouraging , because in qcd one expects the running coupling to be on the order of 1 for widths approaching 1 gev , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the discussion of bound states of effective fermions would not be complete without answering the question of how the binding of effective particles such as nucleons might emerge from a theory such as qcd .",
    "when the latter is already written in terms of effective quarks and gluons with small @xmath51 , the hamiltonian matrix in the effective - particle basis can be cut into block pieces that lie along the diagonal , and touch each other with their corners ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jelita ] ) , some matrix elements being left out .",
    "each of the small blocks can be treated as a separate theory and solved . as a result , one obtains eigenstates or scattering states which are closest to true solutions when their energies lie somewhere in the middle of a block .",
    "the accuracy of the solutions diminishes towards the corners where the small triangle parts should provide increasingly important perturbations from couplings to the neighboring blocks .",
    "[ fig : jelita ] is drawn in the basis of effective quarks and gluons .",
    "baryons and mesons in qcd would correspond to the approximate solutions in the individual blocks .",
    "it is natural to call the blocks channels and the calculation including the interactions between the blocks a coupled - channel theory .",
    "the transition from the original degrees of freedom ( here , effective quarks and gluons ) to the reduced degrees of freedom ( baryons and mesons ) is achieved by choosing the new basis of states : those given by the solution to the channels dynamics when they are treated as separate .",
    "thus , the lowest mass channel with baryon number 2 contains only nucleons interacting through potentials , the next channel with invariant masses between @xmath262 and @xmath263 may include two nucleons and one pion , etc .",
    "the bound or scattering states from higher blocks could be approximated by products of the eigenstates from lower - mass blocks . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the transition step is a change of basis in describing eigenstates of relatively small matrices ( in comparison to the initial hamiltonian matrix ) and taking into account the residual interactions between different channels later to refine the basis states .",
    "the refinement step would be executed in the new basis using the same type of division into blocks , but with the new blocks centered where the previous blocks were least accurate .",
    "this sequence of steps can be repeated many times .",
    "thus , the whole transition process to the effective theory written in terms of new degrees of freedom would form a sequence of patterns indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jelita ] . the shaded shapes in fig .",
    "[ fig : jelita ] indicate the boundaries of non - zero matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian matrices between the incoming and outgoing states , which qualitatively indicates their range in energy .    by the way , it is also natural to see in similar terms the transition from electrons and nuclei to atoms , or from atoms to molecules . the universal character of this scheme is the change of basis in the hilbert space of states in quantum mechanics , and the hamiltonian scheme for effective particles does open this option to detailed studies in all these theories .",
    "once the width is sufficiently small , it slows down , or freezes degrees of freedom that require larger mass changes than @xmath51 to be excited .",
    "one can also imagine that reducing the width farther in the new basis , a next level of effective degrees of freedom can be isolated using the same scheme . if the reduction were started with a theory underlying qcd , i.e. at extremely large @xmath51 , the scope of the reduction scheme would be even greater .    as a final remark let us indicate that quantum field theories such as yukawa theory , or sigma - models , may be helpful in discovering the acceptable structure of channel hamiltonians even without making the transition from qcd to nucleons and mesons explicitly .",
    "this option follows from the fact that when the width in the effective theory is made small enough , the meson - fermion vertex contains a narrow form factor and the emission of mesons is weak and slow , even for quite large coupling constants .",
    "the structure of the small - width effective theory may be then rather simple and universal in the sense that many initial complex theories may reduce to the same small - width effective one .",
    "thus , the apparently academic yukawa theory , or other qfts of that kind , may become very useful in indicating what kind of effective reduced hamiltonians one can expect from the more elaborate analysis that derives nucleon - pion dynamics from qcd .",
    "in fact , a small number of free parameters , such as the form factor width , the size of the coupling constant , or the size of effective masses in a basic set of terms , may be sufficient to reproduce the bulk of the effective model predictions .",
    "it is also possible that no significant width dependence is observed in the model results if the parameters are correlated as if the effective model were derived from a yukawa theory or a sigma - model using only a perturbative expansion for artificially small couplings that only later are extrapolated to the required large values @xcite .",
    "this research has been supported in part by kbn grant number 2 po3b 016 18 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for a hamiltonian @xmath11 , @xmath264 for some low eigenvalues , is replaced using the operation @xmath35 @xcite by an eigenvalue equation for eigenstates @xmath265 of the reduced hamiltonian @xmath56 , given by the following formula , @xmath266 if one splits the initial hamiltonian into the free and interaction parts , @xmath267 one can look for @xmath35 and @xmath56 in perturbation theory in @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to the lowest ( second order ) expression for @xmath56 : @xmath268 where the underlining denotes free energy denominators , displayed in eq.([app : hrij ] ) .",
    "the four - component spinors of fermions and anti - fermions in light - front hamiltonians have the following form . @xmath269 u_{\\lambda}\\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ v_{mp\\lambda}&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{mp^+}}\\left [ p^+\\lambda_++\\lambda_-(m+\\alpha^\\perp p^\\perp)\\right ] v_\\lambda\\ ; , \\label{spinors}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the projection operators are given by @xmath270 the spinors of particles of zero velocity equal @xmath271 and the two - component spinors are @xmath272 the matrices appearing on the right hand side of eq .",
