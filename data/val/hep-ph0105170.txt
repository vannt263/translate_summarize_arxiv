    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the interaction of quarks and gluons .",
    "since qcd is asymptotically free , the coupling constant becomes small when either temperature or the chemical potential , namely the the fermi momentum , is large . by cooper theorem",
    ", fermi surface has instability when an arbitrarily small attractive interaction between quarks presents . for quark ",
    "quark scattering , where the quarks are in the antitriplet @xmath3 , one gluon exchange interaction is attractive and in the @xmath4 , it is repulsive .",
    "thus we expect that , in the case of two quark flavors , the quark  quark condensate in @xmath3 channel is formed and the color superconductivity , spontaneous breakdown of the color gauge symmetry @xmath5 , occurs @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in the sense that the effective dimensional reduction @xmath6 occurs with the large chemical potential as well as the case of @xmath7 in a constant magnetic field @xcite",
    ".    there has been many studies of the color superconductivity in cold and dense qcd using the so - called nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models @xcite , the instanton liquid model @xcite and the schwinger - dyson approach to qcd in weak coupling limit @xcite , in other words , in @xmath8 limit .",
    "the first two models have shown that the superconducting gap could be large as 100 mev .",
    "on the other hand , due to the exchange of the magnetic gluons , the gap from qcd in weak coupling limit could be large as compared to that obtained under the condition which the magnetic gluons acquire static screening mass .",
    "if we extrapolate the gap down to the intermediate region of the chemical potential , it increases up to 100 mev .",
    "however , as temperature grows , the color superconducting gap is reduced , then , the phase undergoes phase transition .",
    "the order of the transition seems to be second order in either case of with or without gauge fields .",
    "however , with gauge fields , there is a possibility of first order or a smooth crossover .",
    "we consider the color superconductivity under the situation where a flavor asymmetry takes place . the color superconductivity at finite flavor asymmetry has been studied in ref .",
    "especially , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that a mixed phase of the normal and the superconducting phase exists with a sufficiently large flavor asymmetry . in this paper",
    ", we study at finite temperature and discuss what extent does the mixed phase persist .",
    "such an investigation has importance in studies of neutron stars and , of course , high - energy heavy - ion collisions at alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) and cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "the study of the color superconductivity in qcd is nontrivial and , therefore , we choose a tractable model to describe the quark  quark condensate .",
    "the most familiar of such models is known as the njl ( -type ) model .",
    "particularly , in the leading order of the @xmath9 expansion , the resultant gap function is independent of momentum and it makes our analysis simple one .",
    "moreover , the structure of the color superconducting phase depends on the number of the quark flavors . at extremely high density ,",
    "where we can neglect the mass of @xmath10 quark , the color - flavor locked phase appears @xcite .",
    "however we expect , at relatively low density , there is a window of two  flavor color superconducting phase .",
    "such being the case , we use the two  flavor , three  color njl - type model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our model and derive the thermodynamic potential at finite density , temperature and flavor asymmetry . then , in sec .",
    "iii , we present numerical results for the thermodynamic potential .",
    "section iv is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "our unit are @xmath11 .",
    "our aim is to explore the phase diagram of two  flavor qcd .",
    "the @xmath12 chially symmetric lagrangian @xcite @xmath13,\\label{eqn : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is our starting point .",
    "the quark field @xmath14 is assigned to the fundamental representation of the color @xmath15 group and carries the flavor index @xmath16 and the color index @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath19 act in the flavor space . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lag ] ) , we include two four  fermion interactions , namely , the scalar isosinglet @xmath20 and pseudo - scalar isotriplet @xmath21 .",
    "however , we do not abandon the possibility of adding other four  fermion interactions ; e.g. , the scalar isotriplet @xmath22 and the pseudo - scalar isosinglet @xmath23 .    applying the fierz transformations to these color singlet interactions",
    ", one can transform them into color @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels . in this paper",
    ", we consider the following scalar isoscalar color @xmath3 diquark condensation which breaks @xmath24 to @xmath25 ; i.e. , taking a third direction as a preferred one in color space , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a charge conjugation matrix , defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 is independent of momentum in our approximation ( mean field approximation or , equivalently , leading order in the @xmath9 expansion ) .",
    "the interaction lagrangian which leads to the diquark condensation is written as @xmath31 , \\label{eqn : lag2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the antisymmetric pauli matrix , @xmath33 is the antisymmetric ( color @xmath3 ) color generator , and the ellipsis denotes irrelevant diquark channels . since the njl model is not renormalizable , one can not define the model until a regularization scheme has been specified . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the thermodynamic potential with a 3d sharp cutoff in momentum space . for a mesonic sector",
    ", we use a set of parameters : a coupling constant @xmath34 and a 3d ultraviolet cutoff @xmath35 gev @xcite .",
    "these parameters reproduce the value of @xmath36 mev and the quark condensate @xmath37 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath38 , mediating an attractive four  fermion diquark interaction , is related to @xmath39 through the fierz transformations . in other words ,",
    "the strength of @xmath38 is fixed by the fierz transformations .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eqn : lag ] ) gives @xmath40 .",
    "however , as mentioned before , one can change the ratio @xmath41 by adding other color singlet channel to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lag ] )",
    ". therefore we take @xmath38 independent on @xmath39 and study the @xmath38 dependence of @xmath30 and a phase structure .",
    "we start our study with an investigation of the thermodynamic potential as a function of @xmath30 at nonzero temperature , `` averaged '' chemical potential and `` isospin '' chemical potential .",
    "the averaged chemical potential @xmath1 and isospin chemical potential @xmath2 are given as follows @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a chemical potential of the @xmath44 quark .",
    "in order to evaluate the thermodynamic potential , one can use auxiliary field method with the saddle point approximation or the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis effective action @xcite up to two - loop level with the nambu - gorkov formalism .",
    "these two methods are correspond to the evaluation at the leading order of the @xmath9 expansion and consistent with each other . the thermodynamic potential @xmath45 in the leading order of the @xmath9 expansion is obtained as follows @xmath46\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ln\\left[\\left((\\omega-\\mu_i)^2-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}^2 -\\mu_b^2\\right)^2 - 4\\mu_b^2{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}^2\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2\\ln\\left[\\left((\\omega+\\mu_i)^2-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}^2 -\\mu_b^2-\\delta^2\\right)^2 - 4\\mu_b^2{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}^2\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2\\ln\\left[\\left((\\omega-\\mu_i)^2-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}^2 -\\mu_b^2-\\delta^2\\right)^2 - 4\\mu_b^2{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}^2\\right]\\bigg{\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the finite temperature thermodynamic potential @xmath47 is obtained by using the formula : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the @xmath50-integration is to be understood that it is round an anti - clockwise contour including the pole of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we obtain the thermodynamic potential as follows @xmath52\\right ) + t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(\\epsilon_{-}(q)+\\mu_i)\\right]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(\\epsilon_{+}(q)-\\mu_i)\\right]\\right ) + t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(\\epsilon_{+}(q)+\\mu_i)\\right]\\right ) \\bigg{\\}}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&4\\int^{\\lambda}\\frac{q^2dq}{2\\pi^2}\\bigg{\\{}e_{-}(q)+e_{+}(q)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(e_{-}(q)-\\mu_i)\\right]\\right ) + t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(e_{-}(q)+\\mu_i)\\right]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(e_{+}(q)-\\mu_i)\\right]\\right ) + t\\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[-\\beta(e_{+}(q)+\\mu_i)\\right]\\right)\\bigg{\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are the gapless ( color 3 ) quasi - particle energies relative to the ( averaged ) fermi surface and @xmath54 are the gapful ( color 1 , 2 ) quasi - particle energies and 3d cutoff @xmath55 is introduced to regularize the divergent integrals .    the extremum condition for @xmath47 with respect to @xmath30 lead to the schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) for @xmath30 at nonzero temperature , density , and flavor asymmetry .",
    "the cooper pairs condensate @xmath56 is related @xmath57 the solution of the sde as @xmath58 the `` baryon number density '' and the `` isospin density '' are obtained by @xmath59",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath38 and @xmath1 dependence of @xmath30 at zero temperature and zero flavor asymmetry .",
    "the value @xmath60 was taken by berges and rajagopal @xcite , where @xmath39 is the coupling constant in @xmath61 ( scalar isosinglet ) channel .",
    "note that we use the @xmath39 different from berges and rajagopal and 3d sharp cutoff instead of introducing a smooth form factor @xmath62 .",
    "then , the behavior of @xmath30 slightly different from theirs . the value @xmath63 and @xmath40 are introduced by the instanton vertex of two  flavor qcd and the @xmath12 symmetric njl model , respectively .",
    "as we can see , @xmath30 is quite sensitive to @xmath38 . for @xmath60",
    ", @xmath30 could be as large as 100 mev .",
    "however , it is about 50 mev for @xmath63 and negligible small for @xmath40 . in the following , we use @xmath60 to get sizeable gap .",
    "figure 2 shows the zero temperature and @xmath64 mev thermodynamic potential as a function of @xmath30 for several @xmath2 . for @xmath30 larger than @xmath2 ,",
    "all curves are coincident with each other .",
    "this is because , for @xmath65 , the flavor asymmetry does not affect the thermodynamic potential . as @xmath2 grows , the potential in the trivial state @xmath66 decreases .",
    "it has two degenerate minima and the superconducting phase and the normal phase coexist at some value of @xmath2 . for more large values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the normal phase is favored . as a result",
    ", @xmath30 behaves constant up to a certain critical value of @xmath2 and , then , jumps to zero .",
    "we have a strong first order phase transition .",
    "we can see the same behavior of the thermodynamic potential and the order parameter in chiral symmetry restoration at zero temperature and finite baryon density .    in fig .",
    "3 , we present the phase diagram as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at zero temperature . along the horizontal axis",
    ", color superconducting phase exists for arbitrary nonzero @xmath1 because the bcs instability exists for arbitrary small coupling strength . on the other hand , as mentioned before , we know that it undergoes a phase transition of first order with increasing flavor asymmetry",
    ". then we get the phase boundary such as shown in fig .",
    "this boundary reflect the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath30 at @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "it is also interesting to see the phase diagram as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure 4 shows the phase diagram in the @xmath68-@xmath69 plane . for the flavor asymmetry",
    "@xmath70 larger than about 15% the system remains in the mixed phase for arbitrarily high densities .",
    "this nature is almost the same as shown in ref .",
    "for the flavor asymmetry larger than about 40% the phase transition is complete and the system undergoes a phase transition into the normal phase .",
    "this point is differ from the results of ref . @xcite and the difference arises from the choice of the parameters .",
    "we now turn to physics at finite temperature .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath71 for @xmath72 mev and @xmath64 mev . at relatively low temperature ,",
    "a first order phase transition occurs . on the other hand , at relatively high temperature",
    ", the phase transition changes to into second order . from the behavior of the thermodynamic potential , the existence of a tricritical point in the @xmath0-@xmath2 plane",
    "is expected . in fig .",
    "7 , we present the typical phase diagram as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 for @xmath1 fixed to 400@xmath73500 mev . it is known that , in four  fermion interaction model which neglects the gauge fields , we have a second order phase transition for @xmath74 and @xmath67 with increasing temperature ( bcs theory predicts the critical temperature @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we have a first order transition for @xmath77 with increasing flavor asymmetry @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the existence of a tricritical point in the @xmath0-@xmath2 plane , where the second order phase transition becomes that of the first order , is expected .",
    "in fact , we found @xmath78 from the condition @xmath79 where we expand the thermodynamic potential , in the vicinity of the tricritical point , as a power series in @xmath30 : @xmath80 therefore , there is a possibility of a first order phase transition as temperature grows , with sufficiently large flavor asymmetry .",
    "in summary , we studied the phase structure of the color superconductivity at finite density , temperature and flavor asymmetry by investigating the thermodynamic potential in the njl model .    since specifying the ratio @xmath41 by the fierz transformations in the mean - field approximation is not unique , we examined the @xmath38 dependence of @xmath30 and found that @xmath30 is quite sensitive to @xmath38 .",
    "first , let us see @xmath2 dependence of @xmath30 .",
    "at zero temperature , as @xmath2 grows , the superconducting gap @xmath30 remains constant until @xmath2 is increased to its critical value and , then , vanishes .",
    "this behavior seems to be the same as obtained by bedaque @xcite .",
    "following alford _",
    "et al . _ , let us consider a concrete example ; a gold nucleus at a baryon density eight times in nuclear matter .",
    "this matter , the number of @xmath81 quark exceed that of @xmath82 quark , corresponds to @xmath83 mev and @xmath84 mev ( up to sign ) .",
    "they have found that the gap is a little ( about 18% ) decreased .",
    "our resultant gap does not changed in this condition .",
    "the distinction maybe arise from the difference in the coupling constant and the regularization scheme .",
    "second , concerning the phase structure , we found the similar phase structure in the @xmath68-@xmath70 plane to that reported by bedaque @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found that the structure of the color superconducting phase is remarkably rich : + ( 1 ) mixed phase appears at sufficiently large flavor asymmetry with temperature less than 40 mev , + ( 2 ) tricritical point exists in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 phase diagram . + the most favorable condition for the color superconductivity , cold and dense quark",
    "matter , are at the core of neutron stars .",
    "however , the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 accomplished in heavy - ion collisions at , for example , ags and sps , maybe reach into the mixed phase , since it lies up until @xmath85 mev ( see fig .",
    "then , if the charged bubbles is formed , it may lead to observable effects , e.g. , an obvious change of the @xmath86 ratio .",
    "our results strongly depend on the regularization scheme , although qualitative features do not changes .",
    "in addition , it seems to be necessary to take into account next - to - leading order in the @xmath9 expansion , because the ratio of @xmath41 has a order @xmath87 .",
    "also , the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the pion condensation should be included in further study .",
    "the pion condensed phase has been confirmed by the monte carlo simulation of two  color qcd @xcite .",
    "we also plan to study the effective potential within qcd in weak coupling limit and the three flavor case where the color flavor locked phase takes place .",
