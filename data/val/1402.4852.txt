    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are powerful tools to study chemical evolution in galaxies .",
    "the spectra of pne have bright emission lines that allow us to calculate physical conditions and ionic abundances in the ionized gas .",
    "the abundance of sulfur , neon , argon , and chlorine in pne reflect the abundances of the interstellar medium at the time the progenitor stars were born .",
    "therefore , these abundances can be used as tracers of interstellar abundances . on the other hand , helium , nitrogen , carbon , and oxygen abundances change as a consequence of nucleosynthesis processes occurring in the star before and during the pn phase .",
    "the analysis of these abundances can give us clues on the efficiencies of nucleosynthesis in low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "the total abundance of one particular element is obtained by adding up the ionic abundances of all the ions present in a nebula .",
    "however , not all the ions are observed , either because the lines are emitted in a different spectral range from the one observed or because the lines are too weak to be detected .",
    "thus , one must estimate the contribution of unobserved ions to the total abundance using ionization correction factors ( icfs ) .",
    "first icfs were proposed by @xcite and they were based on ionization potential similarities .",
    "however these icfs should be taken with caution since the ionization structures do not depend only on ionization potentials ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , icfs may be derived from photoionization models , as those derived , e.g. , by @xcite ; kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 , hereafter kb94 ) ; and @xcite .",
    "they are more reliable but so far have been based on a small number of models .    in this paper",
    "we derive new recipes for the icfs of he , o , n , ne , s , ar , cl , and c using a large grid of models that spans over a wide range of parameters and is representative of most of the observed pne .",
    "we also provide analytical formulae to estimate the error bars associated with our icfs .",
    "our motivations are two .",
    "first , some of the commonly adopted icfs do not correct properly for unobserved ions .",
    "second , the errors in icfs are usually not considered when estimating errors in element abundances .",
    "our results should be useful for empirical abundance studies .",
    "in particular , an accurate determination of the element abundances and their associated uncertainties is essential in the study of abundance gradients in galaxies .",
    "we examine the accuracy of our icfs by applying them to several families of photoionization models computed from different assumptions .",
    "the studied performed by @xcite is the only one in the literature investigating the errors arising from the use of icfs in pne .",
    "our sample of models cover a wider range of physical parameters and we include several assumptions not considered in @xcite , such as the non - constant density distribution , the combination of two models , or the inclusion of dust grains in the nebulae .",
    "we also test our icfs on a large sample of observed pne , and compare the computed abundances with the ones obtained with other icfs ( mainly the ones by kb94 ) .",
    "the analysis here is restricted to ions with emission lines in the optical range , icfs for ultraviolet and infrared observations will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the ionization structure of a nebula depends principally on the spectral energy distribution shape of the ionizing spectrum , in this case essentially determined by the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) of the ionizing star . for a given @xmath0",
    ", it also depends on the ratio of the flux of ionizing photons reaching a given point in the nebula and the local electron density .",
    "the larger this ratio , the higher the ionization state .",
    "finally , it also depends on the electron temperature of the nebular gas , since recombination is more efficient at low temperature .",
    "photoionization codes allow one to compute the detailed ionization structure of the various elements present in a model nebula , by taking into account all the processes that govern ionization and recombination ( i.e. mostly photoionization , radiative and di - electronic recombination , and charge exchange ) , as well as all the heating and cooling processes that determine the electron temperature .    for our study , we have computed a grid of spherical photoionization models using cloudy c10.01 @xcite .",
    "the free parameters are the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) and the luminosity ( l@xmath1 ) of the central star , the inner nebular radius ( r@xmath2 ) , and the hydrogen density of the gas ( n@xmath3 ) .",
    "these parameters take the values shown in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we use both blackbodies ( b ) and rauch atmospheres ( rau ) for the spectral energy distributions of the ionizing stars , and include constant ( c ) and gaussian ( g ) nebular density distributions .",
    "rauch models are constructed with the atmospheres from @xcite for @xmath0  = 50000 , 75000 , 100000 , 125000 , 150000 , and 180000 k. we only use one value for the stellar surface gravity , @xmath4 .",
    "this parameter varies from @xmath5 to @xmath6 during the evolution of the pn but we do not expect this has an effect on our results .    for radiation bounded ( r ) models the calculations are performed until the ionic fraction of h@xmath7 falls below 0.02 .",
    "matter bounded ( m ) models are simply obtained by reading out cloudy results at 40% , 60% , and 80% of the total gas mass .",
    "this percentage is given by the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "radiation bounded models have @xmath8 = 1 whereas matter bounded models have @xmath9 . in order to mimic some aspherical pne",
    "we combine pairs of the above models ( co ) with the same ionizing source , inner radius and gas density but different quantities of gas .",
    "the input abundances used for the solar ( s ) models are the default pn abundances in cloudy except for those elements with abundances equal to 10@xmath10 , for which we use their values in the cloudy ism set . the pn set is based on the works by @xcite and @xcite and is not necessarily representative of solar neighborhood abundances ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but , as we will show in section  [ sec : effect ] , our icfs do not depend on the detailed abundances .",
    "the input abundances for the elements studied here are , in units of @xmath11(x / h ) , 11.00 ( he ) , 8.89 ( c ) , 8.26 ( n ) , 8.64 ( o ) , 8.04 ( ne ) , 7.0 ( s ) , 5.23 ( cl ) , and 6.43 ( ar ) . to explore the effect of metallicity in our results",
    "we also compute high metallicity models ( with twice solar abundances , h ) and low metallicity models ( with half solar abundances , l ) .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] describes the characteristics and names of the different families of models computed .",
    "the number in the last column refers to the final number of models of each family after applying all the selection criteria described below .",

    ", we only consider those objects with @xmath24 or @xmath25 within the range of validity .",
    "the error bars in the plots arise only from the uncertainties associated with our icfs , not from the uncertainties in the line fluxes .",
    "figure  [ fig : obstot_1 ] compares the helium abundances obtained through equation  ( [ eq : he_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : he_2 ] ) and the ones computed with the icfs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the error bars in the plot arise from the uncertainties in our icf .",
    "we are not considering here the uncertainties related to line fluxes , which are in general around @xmath26 dex for helium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . only the pne without he@xmath27ii lines in the spectra",
    "are included in the plot since the abundance of he@xmath28 is probably negligible in the others .",
    "our values of he / h , including the error bars , are generally lower than those computed with the icfs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these values of he / h are probably overestimated , at least in the pne with @xmath23 ( represented in the figure by symbols without upper error bars ) where we do not expect a significant contribution of neutral helium ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : he]b ) .",
    "the oxygen abundances computed with three different icfs are compared in figure  [ fig : obstot_2 ] .",
    "our icf leads to o / h values similar to the ones obtained from the icf by kb94 whereas o / h values computed with the icf by @xcite are generally higher than ours .",
    "as we have shown in figure  [ fig : o]b , the latter icf overestimates the oxygen abundances in cases where he@xmath29 is present , since it assumes that no o@xmath29 can be present in the he@xmath29 zone , which is not correct .",
    "the error bars in these plots correspond to the uncertainties associated with our icf , estimated with equation  ( [ eq : o_2 ] ) .",
    "note that in high ionization objects , the error bars can be greater than the usual error bars which result only from the propagation of the line intensity errors into the physical conditions and ionic abundances ( around @xmath300.05 dex , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+    figure  [ fig : obstot_3 ] compares our values of n / o , ne / o , s / o , ar / o , and cl / o with the ones computed using icfs from other authors . for chlorine",
    "we use the icf proposed by @xcite because this element is not considered in kb94 . for the other four elements we use the icfs by kb94 .",
    "the differences in the computed values of n / o , ne / o , and ar / o are significant .    in general , the s / o values derived from our icf and from the icf by kb94 ( originally proposed by @xcite ) are similar within errors",
    ". there are some exceptions showing higher s / o values when using our icf .",
    "this result is relevant in regard to the so - called sulfur anomaly @xcite , the fact that many pne show low sulfur abundances compared to h  ii regions of the same metallicity ( measured by o / h ) . figure  [ fig : obstot_4 ] shows the values of s / o as a function of o / h .",
    "the values for the sun and for orion @xcite are also plotted for comparison .",
    "it can be seen that the s / o values in most of our sample pne are lower than those in orion and in the sun .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed to explained this result , the most accepted one being the incorrect correction for unobserved ions of sulfur .",
    "our results suggest that the icf is , at least , not the main cause of this anomaly .",
    "here , we want to test the validity of our icfs by checking that some of the computed abundances ratios do not show any specific trend with the ionization degree .",
    "it is important to consider pne covering a wide range of physical conditions , therefore we use the whole sample of pne .",
    "we consider only the results for ne / o , s / o , ar / o , cl / o , and ar / s . these five elements",
    "are mainly produced in massive stars and they are expected to evolve in lockstep . therefore , their relative ratios are not expected to depend on the degree of ionization and they can be used to see if our icfs show any trend with the degree of ionization . however , several nucleosynthesis models do predict some oxygen production / destruction in low metallicity environments ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which could perhaps lead to a weak tendency of the above abundance rations with the nebular excitation .",
    "moreover , given that several pne in the solar neighborhood have higher oxygen abundances than nearby h  ii regions @xcite , even at solar metallicities oxygen production in pne could be occurring .",
    "the results for helium , carbon , and nitrogen are not discussed here since these elements can be produced in the interiors of asymptotic giant branch stars , depending on the progenitor mass , and the ionization of pne depends on the mass of the central star @xcite . a trend between n / o , c / o or he / h and the degree of ionization would not be surprising and thus , these abundance ratios are not useful to test our icfs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : obstot_5 ] we display the values of ne / o , s / o , ar / o , and cl / o as a function of the degree of ionization .",
    "the absence of a trend in this plot argues in favor of our icf recipes .",
    "this figure shows that the error bars associated with the icfs can be higher than the usual uncertainties in the abundance ratios which arise only from the uncertainties in the line fluxes and range from @xmath31 dex to @xmath320.2 dex depending on the element ( and the quality of the observations ) .",
    "the abundance ratios ar / s are plotted in figure  [ fig : obstot_6 ] as a function of the degree of ionization .",
    "this abundance ratio is even less suspect of being affected by nucleosynthesis processes in the progenitor star than the abundance ratios involving oxygen .",
    "a certain amount of sulfur atoms in some pne can be trapped in dust grains ( such as mgs * ? ? ? * ) or molecules @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious trend between the ar / s values and the degree of ionization , which tends to support our icfs .",
    "the high ar / s values obtained in eight pne could be a consequence of sulfur depletion into dust grains ( such as mgs , see @xcite ) or molecules @xcite .",
    "we have computed a large grid of photoionization models covering a wide range of physical parameters representative of most of the observed pne . using this grid of models , we derived new recipes for the icfs of he , o , n , ne , s , ar , cl , and c that should be used for optical observations .",
    "we also provide analytical expressions for the associated uncertainties",
    ". this should be useful for empirical abundance studies since errors in icfs are usually not considered when estimating errors in element abundances .",
    "the icfs are valid for all the computed families of models , which include models with different input metallicities , different gas density distributions , presence or absence of dust , or different spectral energy distribution of the ionizing source . besides , our icfs are valid for volume integrated observations as well as for pencil beam observations in the vicinity of the central star",
    ". therefore they can be safely used in a large variety of pne observations .    for each correction scheme , we define the region of validity , outside this zone the error bars are so large that no meaningful abundance can be computed . objects presenting such @xmath19/(@xmath20+@xmath19 )  and @xmath21/(@xmath22+@xmath21 )  should be removed from abundance computations using our icfs for the corresponding element .",
    "a tailored photoionization model is recommended for such cases .    in the case of helium",
    "we do not suggest the derivation of an icf based on other ions since the relative populations of helium ions depend essentially on the @xmath0  of the central star while the ones of metal ions also depend on the ionization parameter .",
    "we recommend to use icf(he@xmath33 + he@xmath29 ) = 1 and , for those objects with @xmath34 , incorporate the correction for unobserved ions in the error bars .    for nitrogen and neon ,",
    "we propose icfs based both on @xmath21/(@xmath22+@xmath21 )  and @xmath19/(@xmath20+@xmath19 ) .",
    "the uncertainties associated with our computed n / o and ne / o values are significantly lower ( especially for pne with low @xmath0  central stars ) than those derived using the icfs suggested by kb94 .    as for the other elements we suggest icfs based on @xmath21/(@xmath22+@xmath21 )  or @xmath19/(@xmath20+@xmath19 ) . in general , the uncertainties related to our icfs are significantly lower than the ones related to other icfs in the literature .    we have shown that the error bars associated with icfs should be taken into account in the total error budget on abundances since they represent a significant budget of total errors abundances .    although our sulfur abundances are somewhat higher than those derived from the icf by kb94 , the s / o values obtained in most of the studied pne are still lower than those in orion or in the sun .",
    "this suggests that the icf is not the principal cause of the sulfur anomaly .",
    "the abundance ratios ne / o , s / o , cl / o , and ar / o computed with our icfs in a wide sample of observed pne ( covering a wide range of ionization , central star temperature , and metallicity ) do not show any noticeable trend with the degree of ionization .",
    "this validates our icfs for abundance studies .",
