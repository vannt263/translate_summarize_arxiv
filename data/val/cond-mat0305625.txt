    "in recent years , a substantial amount of research has been focused on model systems of heterogeneous adaptive agents interacting competitively , as e.g. in games , markets or ecosystems , in the attempt to understand the mechanisms by which real systems create exploitable information , and to clarify the origin of their complex collective behavior @xcite .",
    "the minority game , with its several variants , is perhaps the most studied of such models @xcite . in its simplest version ,",
    "it describes a population of boundedly rational players with fully heterogeneous beliefs who , at each round of the game , make their strategic decisions basing on some public information pattern ( the `` state of the world '' ) aiming to be in the minority group .",
    "the minority - wins mechanism , which serves the purpose of modeling competition for a scarce resource , translates into a strong assumption on the behavioral traits and expectations of players .",
    "indeed , it turns out that in order to maximize their expected utilities under the minority - wins rule , agents have to enhance their initial heterogeneity and differentiate themselves as much as possible from each other .",
    "this is rather intuitive : if agents would learn to make decisions similarly to each other , being in a minority would become a rather unlikely event . on the other hand , one might also consider another tendency that is often encountered in real agents , namely that toward imitation , say of an agent who believes that his / her payoff is maximized when he / she acts according to the majority . in this paper , we consider a mixed majority - minority game , to study the effects of competition in a population formed by two types of players , i.e. those whose short - term behavior is driven by imitation ( who play a majority game ) , and those who are instead anti - imitative ( and play a minority game ) .    from the viewpoint of economic modeling , our system represents a simple abstraction for a market where two classes of economic agents , namely `` fundamentalists '' and `` trend - followers '' , interact . the former ",
    "see @xcite for details  create their expectations under the assumption that the market price is close to its `` fundamental '' value , i.e. to a stationary equilibrium , and correspond to minority game players .",
    "the latter , instead , extrapolate a trend from recent price increments and assume that the next increment will occur in the direction of the trend ( see also @xcite ) ; they correspond to majority game players . in real markets , fundamentalists act as a kind of elastic force that pulls the price toward its fundamental value , while trend - followers destabilize the market by driving the price away from it .",
    "they are in particular widely believed to be the main actors in the infamous buy rushes known as `` bubbles '' . understandably then",
    ", modeling the interplay between trend - followers and fundamentalists is a basic issue in the theory of markets , and several models have been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in most cases , however , insight can be gained only from numerical simulations due to the complexity of the microscopic definitions .",
    "the mixed model we consider here has the advantage of being simple enough to be analytically tractable via the methods of statistical mechanics , notwithstanding its phenomenological richness .",
    "the effects due to the presence of trend - followers are fully discernible and an interpretation in market terms is quite straightforward . besides , the majority game is an interesting model in itself , that from the theoretical viewpoint shares some features with the hopfield model @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , it has not received much attention so far @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the basic definitions of the model are given in sec .  2 , together with an outline of the results .",
    "the static approximation to the analysis of the asymptotic macroscopic properties is expounded in sec .",
    "it is based on the formal analogy with zero - temperature spin glasses first derived in @xcite for the pure minority game , whose stationary states were shown to be ( approximately ) given by the minima of a random hamiltonian . in our case , the resulting optimization problem is slightly more subtle and its solution requires a negative dimensional replica theory of the kind already used for `` minimax games ''",
    "@xcite , close in spirit to the method of partial annealing @xcite .",
    "sec .  4 is devoted to the dynamical solution of the `` batch '' version of the model , which is carried out employing the generating functional technique @xcite along the lines of @xcite .",
    "some details about this calculation are given in the appendix . finally , in sec .",
    "5 , we formulate our conclusions .",
    "the setup we consider is as follows .",

    "strategies are evaluated according to their `` performance '' @xmath16 . at each round @xmath17",
    ", players receive an information pattern @xmath18 chosen at random with uniform probability in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , each player picks his so - far best - performing strategy , @xmath20 , and formulates the bid it prescribes , i.e. @xmath21 . the aggregate action of all players at round @xmath17 ( in economic terms , the `` excess demand '' ) is just @xmath22 once @xmath23 is known , majority ( resp .",
    "minority ) game players reward their strategies for which @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) . hence the performance updating or learning process takes place according to @xmath26 where @xmath27 for minority game players and @xmath28 for majority game players , and the game moves into the next round .",

    ", one is interested in characterizing the macroscopic properties of the stationary state ( if any exists ) of ( [ dyna ] ) .",
    "two quantities have been introduced to this aim . as a measure of global efficiency",
    "one uses the `` volatility '' @xmath44 that is , the magnitude of market fluctuations ( @xmath45 by construction ) .",

    ", it is reasonable to take @xmath47 , which corresponds to `` random players '' who at each round randomize uniformly between the two possible actions .",
    "when @xmath48 one can say that agents are , to some degree , cooperating . from the viewpoint of information creation , the relevant quantity is instead the `` predictability '' or `` available information '' @xmath49 whose meaning is discussed at length in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is that when @xmath50 there exists at least one state of the world , say @xmath8 , such that @xmath51 , i.e. for which there is an action that is more likely to be the winning action .",

    "instead , trend - followers dominate the game and the global efficiency decreases steadily with @xmath54 and @xmath0 .",
    "the market is asymmetric ( @xmath50 ) for all @xmath54 and the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath53 diminishes as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath56",
    ", one has @xmath57 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath46 on the initial conditions is arguably very weak ( obviously provided initial conditions are not too biased ) .",
    "the case @xmath58 possesses some special features and will be treated separately @xcite .    in order to get some theoretical insight",
    ", one can follow the line of reasoning adopted for the pure minority game , for which it was shown by constructing the continuous - time limit of ( [ dyna ] ) that the average asymptotic value of @xmath59 , denoted by @xmath60 , can be obtained by minimizing the random function @xmath61 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",
    "( notice that the @xmath60 s are ` soft ' spin : @xmath63 . )",
    "we will not discuss here the limitations of this approximation and refer the reader to the original literature @xcite for a critical discussion . in the limit @xmath12",
    ", this problem could be tackled using spin - glass techniques , because @xmath64 ( here , @xmath65 and the over - line denotes an average over disorder ) .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath66 requires the replica trick @xcite . for @xmath67",
    ", @xmath68 has a unique minimum , hence the stationary state can be fully described by the replica - symmetric solution of ( [ min ] ) .",
    "this argument can be easily reformulated for the pure majority game .",
    "the corresponding optimization problem turns out to be @xmath69 a few comments are in order .",
    "first , it is easy to see that @xmath70 , which implies that minority game players roughly tend to minimize the available information , while majority ones tend to maximize it .",
    "second , at odds with @xmath68 , @xmath71 possesses many minima , hence the stationary state of the majority game will always depend on the initial conditions of the dynamics ( even though the macroscopic observables @xmath46 and @xmath53 might take on the same or very similar values in all minima ) .",
    "basing on well - known properties of the hopfield model @xcite , one expects the true minima of @xmath71 to be described by solutions of ( [ maj ] ) that break replica symmetry .",
    "moreover , as happens in attractor neural networks with extensively many patterns , a `` retrieval '' phase is to be expected for small enough @xmath54 where , due to correlations between the initial conditions and one specific pattern , say @xmath72 , the overlap @xmath73 is @xmath74 , and vanishing as @xmath12 , for all @xmath8 s except @xmath72 , for which it is finite .",
    "the fact that agents can ` condense ' around a given pattern implies that every time that pattern is presented to them a buy ( or sell ) rush takes place . solving ( [ maj ] )",
    "is hence a non - trivial task in itself , and requires a detailed study @xcite .",
    "generalizing to our case , one finds that the stationary @xmath60 s for the mixed majority - minority model can be obtained by solving the following problem : @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) denote collective the @xmath60 variables of minority ( resp .",
    "majority ) game players and @xmath78 operations can be interchanged . in general",
    ", this leads to different solutions . in our case , however , one can verify that the main results would not change , though the intermediate steps ( e.g. the definition of @xmath79 ) would vary ] .",
    "hence the mixed game where both minority and majority players are present at the same time requires a minimization of @xmath68 in certain directions ( the minority ones ) and a maximization in others ( the majority ones ) .",
    "again , this problem can be tackled by a replica theory .",
    "the idea @xcite is to introduce two ` inverse temperatures ' @xmath80 and @xmath81 for minority and majority players respectively , such that @xmath82 with the following generalized partition function : @xmath83}=\\int d\\boldsymbol{m}_2{\\left}[\\int d\\boldsymbol{m}_1 ~e^{-\\beta_1\\mathcal{h}}{\\right}]^{-\\gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 . in physical jargon , this describes a system where : first , the @xmath76 variables are thermalized at a positive temperature @xmath85 with hamiltonian @xmath68 at fixed @xmath77 ; then , the @xmath77 variables are thermalized at a negative temperature @xmath86 with an effective hamiltonian @xmath87 defined by @xmath88 .",
    "the disorder average can be carried out with the help of a ` nested ' replica trick .",
    "first , one replicates the minority variables by treating the exponent @xmath89 as a positive integer @xmath90 ( in the end , the limit @xmath91 must be taken ) .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) thus becomes @xmath92^{r}=\\int d\\boldsymbol{m}_2 { \\left}[\\int e^{-\\beta_1\\sum_{r}\\mathcal{h}(\\{\\boldsymbol{m}_1^r\\ } , \\boldsymbol{m}_2)}\\prod_{r=1,r}d\\boldsymbol{m}_1^r{\\right}]\\ ] ] then a second replication is needed . ] ,",
    "this time on the @xmath77 variables : @xmath93 at this point we have two replica indexes with different roles : the @xmath94 replicas have been introduced to deal with the disorder , and their number @xmath17 will eventually go to zero , as usual ; the @xmath95 replicas have been introduced to deal with the negative temperature , and their number @xmath90 must be set to a negative value .",
    "majority variables bear just one index , while minority ones have two .",
    "we can interpret this fact by saying that @xmath96 indicates a particular configuration of the majority variables , i.e. a given manifold in the whole @xmath97 space ; and @xmath98 indicates the minority coordinates in that particular manifold .    in sec .",
    "3 we will solve ( [ minimax ] ) in the limit @xmath12 using ( [ zn ] ) as a starting point . evidently , retrieval solutions for the majority part become increasingly important as @xmath0 gets bigger .",
    "we will however neglect this aspect ( which in the mixed case leads to a serious lengthening ) .",
    "results obtained in this way give a very good agreement with numerical simulations , suggesting that retrieval does nt substantially affect the average macroscopic properties of the game .",
    "of course , it is expected to play a very important role for phenomena that are local in time ( like `` bubbles '' ) .",
    "besides this static approximation , we will also tackle the dynamics ( [ dyna ] ) straightforwardly , resorting to the generating - functional method to carry out the disorder - average .",
    "again , we will neglect the possibility of retrieval .",
    "following @xcite , we will focus on the ` batch ' version of the model .",
    "dynamical results obtained in this way turn out to coincide nicely with their static counterpart and suggest that the transition occurring at @xmath55 for @xmath1 is related essentially to the onset of anomalous response , as in the pure minority game .",
    "we will calculate the critical line @xmath99 , showing that @xmath100 as @xmath101 . for @xmath2 , the response is always finite and the macroscopic properties are dominated by the contribution of trend followers .",
    "to begin , let us re - write the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) as @xmath102 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath103 ( resp .",
    "@xmath104 ) denotes both the set and the cardinality of the set of minority ( resp .",

    "subsequently , the average over the disorder can be easily performed using the distribution @xmath107 ( @xmath7 ) and the definitions of @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "so that after a little algebra one gets ( all numerical factors are ` hidden ' in the @xmath118 shorthand ) : @xmath119 where the effective action @xmath10 is given by ( @xmath120 ; @xmath121 ) @xmath122+\\nonumber\\\\\\fl + ( 1-f ) \\log\\int_{-1}^{+1}[\\prod_{a , r}dm_1^{a , r } ] ~e^{{{\\rm i}}\\sum_{abrs}m_1^{ar}\\widehat{q}_{ar , bs}m_1^{bs } } + f\\log\\int_{-1}^{+1 } [ \\prod_a dm_2^a]~e^{{{\\rm i}}\\sum_{ab}m_2^a\\widehat{p}_{ab}m_2^b}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath123 \\label{matricet}\\ ] ] @xmath124 stands for the @xmath125 identity matrix while @xmath126 denotes the @xmath125 matrix with all elements equal to @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128 is the kronecker product . in ( [ action ] ) one can easily recognize some parts coming from the minority agents ( those proportional to @xmath129 ) and others coming from the majority agents .",
    "these contributions are _ not _ factorized ( in that event , the mixed problem would be trivial ) but are interconnected via the determinant of @xmath130 .",
    "to proceed further , one has to formulate anstze for the overlap matrices and then perform the integral ( [ inte ] ) in the limit @xmath12 by the steepest descent method .",
    "let us first arrange @xmath115 in a convenient matrix form .",
    "we choose to order the indexes in such a way that each row is characterized by a couple @xmath131 ; along the row , the index @xmath94 is first kept fixed while @xmath95 varies from @xmath127 to @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath115 is thus naturally subdivided in blocks of size @xmath132 , the blocks along the diagonal corresponding to a given value of @xmath133 .",
    "we remind that keeping @xmath94 fixed corresponds to selecting , in the global configuration space , a well defined manifold with @xmath134 inside which @xmath68 is minimized with respect to the @xmath76 variables .",
    "@xmath135 can be thus interpreted as the overlap between two configurations of the same constrained minority problem .",
    "it is natural to assume for these diagonal sub - blocks the same matrix structure of a pure minority game , that is a symmetric form with a diagonal element @xmath136 and an off - diagonal one @xmath137 . on the other hand , elements of the type @xmath138 with @xmath139 correspond to overlaps between two minority configurations in different majority manifolds , and the simplest choice one can make is to take @xmath140 for all of them . in this way @xmath115",

    "notice that , contrary to standard replica calculations , here the block size @xmath90 is not a variational parameter , but its value is fixed by the nature of the problem . for consistency ,",
    "we adopt the same ansatz for the conjugated matrix @xmath145 .",

    "to summarize , we have studied the mixed majority - minority game with random external information . neglecting ` retrieval ' ( i.e. the possibility that trend - followers flock in presence of a particular information pattern )",

    "the two approaches match nicely and agree with numerical results for the macroscopic observables @xmath46 and @xmath53 in a satisfactory way .",
    "this suggests that retrieval does not affect such quantities significantly .",
    "our results also indicate that when fundamentalists outnumber trend - followers , the macroscopic behavior of the system ( ` phase transition ' with ergodicity breaking from an inefficient phase at high @xmath54 to an efficient one at low @xmath54 ) can be explained by the onset of anomalous response , that is by a divergence of the integrated response , as in the pure minority game .",
    "we have calculated the line of critical points in the @xmath188 plane showing that the inefficient phase gets larger as @xmath0 increases .",
    "when trend - followers dominate , instead , the system is always inefficient and low volatility states disappear . as a byproduct",
    ", we have provided an approximate static and dynamical solution of the majority game .",
    "a greater effort is nevertheless needed in order to incorporate the possibility of ` herding ' in both the replica theory and the path - integral solution .",
    "we expect retrieval states to exist at low @xmath54 for any @xmath281 . while such states should nt affect global time - averaged properties ( i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath53 ) significantly , they are likely to play a most crucial role in such phenomena as `` bubbles '' , that in our setting can be seen as localized in time .",
    "it is also likely that rsb occurs at very low @xmath54 for any @xmath281 , in pretty much the same way as rsb occurs for any non - zero market impact in the pure minority game @xcite .",
    "let us finally remark two aspects of the present model that can be criticized and hence improved . in first place , all players can in principle",
    "win at the same time ( i.e. the available resources are infinite ) , which is a clearly unrealistic situation ( albeit extremely unlikely in our disordered setup with @xmath12 ) . secondly , in a market a large buy rush today is justified by the belief that _ tomorrow _ the price will rise again so that for instance one will be able to sell at a higher price .",
    "so in a majority game it would perhaps be more correct to measure the effectiveness of a trading decision made today by what the payoff will have been tomorrow @xcite .",
    "in other words , a player making a trading decision @xmath282 at round @xmath17 should receive a payoff @xmath283 at round @xmath284 .",
    "instead , in our model , his payoff is @xmath285 . in spite of these limitations",
    ", we see that our model does indeed capture some of the features one expects to find in markets where fundamentalists and trend - followers compete .",
    "also , we believe that some of the issues listed above , starting with retrieval , can be taken into account , possibly with modest modifications . in our view , a possibly more interesting generalization would consist in allowing the @xmath29 s to be dynamical variables , in order to give agents the possibility to change their character .",
    "some work along these lines is currently in progress .",
    "we are grateful to a cavagna , m marsili , g parisi and f ricci - tersenghi for useful discussions and suggestions , and in particular to m marsili for disclosing some results of @xcite prior to publication .",
