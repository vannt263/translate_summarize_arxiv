    "studies of the properties and response of matter under extreme conditions rely increasingly on lasers to induce dynamic loading by ablation . compared with the canonical technique of impact - induced shocks ,",
    "laser ablation is more convenient for studying phenomena on shorter time scales ( nanoseconds rather than microseconds ) , for investigating the properties of single crystals and the basic microstructural processes , and for developing new diagnostics .",
    "however , laser ablation has potential disadvantages including uncertainties in loading history , spatial variations in irradiance from speckles or the overall intensity envelope , and the possibility of heating the sample under investigation by hot electrons or bremsstrahlung x - rays .",
    "a thorough understanding of the processes of ablative loading is necessary to assure that the response of the sample can be distinguished from phenomena associated with the ablation process .    in many experiments ,",
    "dynamic loading can be induced by ablation of the sample material itself .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that spatial variations and preheat were negligible , for ablatively - generated shocks from @xmath1100mpa to 1tpa in elements @xcite and compounds @xcite , and for ramp compression @xcite . in other experiments , it is highly desirable to use the laser energy to ablate a well - controlled layer of a different material , in contact with the sample .",
    "advantages of a separate ablator include the ability to restrict multi - electron - volt ablation temperatures to elements of low atomic number irrespective of the sample material , reducing the risk of generating hard x - rays ; smoothing of small - scale spatial variations by beam dispersion , radiation transport , and mechanical equilibration within the ablation plasma ; and the ability to use a single ablator of known plasma properties for experiments on less well - understood sample materials .",
    "a current interest in dynamic loading experiments is the use of x - ray diffraction to study the sample material in the compressed state @xcite . with ramp compression",
    ", the material of highest compression is closest to the ablation surface , so it is desirable to pass the x - rays in and out through the ablator and the ablation plume .",
    "it is thus particularly desirable to restrict the ablator to elements of low atomic number , dissimilar to the sample .",
    "when the sample material is ablated directly , heat conduction from the plasma and re - condensation of ablated material at the end of the laser pulse can lead to material with a locally different microstructure @xcite , an added complication when interpreting the microstructure of recovered samples .",
    "a dissimilar ablator acts as a palliative in this case . by appropriate choice of material ,",
    "an ablator may also increase the efficiency of conversion of laser energy to pressure in the sample .",
    "an ablator layer can however complicate dynamic loading experiments .",
    "the time at which the load is first applied to the sample depends on the ablator thickness and the laser irradiance .",
    "the mechanical impedance mismatch between the ablator and the sample causes wave interactions , leading to multiple waves in the sample which must be discriminated from the response of the sample . if the composition and properties of the ablator material are not adequately known , it introduces additional uncertainty in the experiments .",
    "plastics are attractive ablator materials as they are stable to handle and readily available with compositions of low atomic number , such as polystyrene ( c@xmath2h@xmath2)@xmath3 and polyparaxylylene - n ( parylene - n ) ( c@xmath2h@xmath2)@xmath3 , and polyethene ( c@xmath4h@xmath5)@xmath3 . deposition and coating techniques exist which can produce layers of uniform and well - characterized thickness @xcite .",
    "polystyrene and parylene - n ablators have been used as a coating for glass spheres in inertial confinement fusion experiments .",
    "previous studies have investigated the properties of the ablation plasma including two dimensional effects in planar targets @xcite , and have investigated the generation and mitigation of preheat in the sample @xcite .",
    "significant discrepancies have been identified between pressures inferred from experiments and predicted in radiation hydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "parylene layers have been used in material dynamics experiments at lower irradiances , again with some discrepancy between simulation and experiment @xcite .    here",
    "we present studies of the behavior of plastic ablators under conditions relevant to shock physics and material dynamics experiments , including sensitivities to uncertainties in the composition or equation of state of the ablator , and wave interactions caused by the impedance mismatch with the sample .",
    "the effect of wave interactions is presented in a form convenient for the design of laser - driven shock experiments .",
    "the response of a plastic layer to intense laser irradiance , and the effect of the impedance mismatch between the plastic and a denser sample material behind , were investigated using numerical simulations .",
    "laser - matter interaction is non - linear and time - dependent , so spatially - resolved radiation hydrodynamics is needed to integrate the coupled radiation transport and continuum dynamics equations forward in time . in the regime of interest , laser ablation and dynamic loading can be simulated accurately by assuming three temperature hydrodynamics ( ions , electrons , and radiation ) , including thermal conduction and radiation diffusion , and calculating the absorption of the laser energy in the expanding plasma cloud through the electrical conductivity @xcite . thermal conduction and radiation diffusion",
    "are necessary only near the ablated surface of the plastic : the bulk of the ablator and the sample behind are affected only by the hydrodynamics .",
    "material dynamics experiments are designed to apply a simple loading history to the sample : ideally close to one - dimensional in space , i.e. with a time - dependence that is independent of position over a region of the sample surface .",
    "experiments are usually designed so that edge effects , two- or three - dimensional dependencies in the loading history , do not affect some portion of the sample for long enough for the one - dimensional response to be measured .",
    "we therefore use one - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics , and estimate the size of the region affected by the edges .",
    "radiation hydrodynamics is the simultaneous solution of the continuum dynamics , heat conduction , and radiation transport equations @xcite . using the lagrangian frame of reference , in which time derivatives are expressed along characteristics moving locally with the material , the equations of continuum dynamics are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is time , @xmath8 the mass density , @xmath9 the particle velocity , @xmath10 the pressure , and @xmath11 the specific internal energy .",

    "simulations were performed using the hyades radiation hydrocode , version 01.05.11 @xcite .",
    "this hydrocode used a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lagrangian finite - difference discretization of the material and leapfrog time integration , with shock waves stabilized using artificial viscosity .",
    "the radiation flux limiter was set to 0.03 of the free stream value - a common choice for simulations of this type @xcite .",
    "the ablation properties of plastic coatings were investigated by radiation hydrodynamics simulations as described above , to predict the relationship between irradiance and pressure , ablation rates , and the sensitivity to composition of the plastic .",
    "the properties of the plastic were represented through models for its pressure - volume - energy equation of state ( eos ) , its conductivities , and its opacity .",

    "the molecular structure should become unimportant once the plastic has been converted to plasma .",
    "the models for parylene - d ( sesame tables 7770 and 17770 ) @xcite were developed earlier and have been used more commonly in radiation hydrodynamics simulations , so these models were used for the studies of general ablation behavior described next .    to allow a fine spatial resolution of the surface to be ablated , without requiring the same resolution in the bulk of the plastic where it remains solid ,",
    "the material was discretized with geometrically - expanding cells .",
    "the expansion factor between successive cells was around 1 - 5% : small enough to avoid inaccuracy in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the smallest cell , at the surface where ablation starts , was chosen to have an initial size in the few nanometer range . numerical convergence with respect to spatial resolution",
    "was tested by performing simulations with 200 or 300 zones , with an expansion ratio of 2.5%  or 2.0%  respectively , giving zone widths of around 9.0 or 2.6 nm at the ablation surface .",
    "the ablation pressure was around 5%  higher in the finer - mesh simulations , indicating an adequate level of mesh convergence .",
    "the finer mesh was used for all subsequent simulations .    for the ablation rate and pressure study ,",
    "the plastic was chosen to be 50@xmath36 m thick , and the laser pulse was 10ns long with constant irradiance . to avoid numerical oscillations ,",
    "the irradiance was taken to rise from and fall to zero over 0.1ns , which is typical of the laser systems used for the material dynamics experiments of interest here .",
    "the critical surface of the plasma was predicted to remain within a few micrometers of the initial position of the ablator , so the plasma plume should be essentially 1d .",
    "release and cooling at late times would be faster than predicted using 1d simulations , because of lateral expansion .    in the simulations , the surface of the plastic was heated to plasma conditions rapidly after the start of the laser pulse .",
    "the plasma then absorbed the incident laser energy , forming a nearly steady state plume close to the plastic .",
    "the plasma pressure and reaction to plasma flow induced an elevated pressure in the remaining condensed - phase plastic , driving a shock wave .",
    "as was found previously @xcite , a laser pulse of constant irradiance did not induce a constant driving pressure in the condensed region .",
    "instead , there was an initial spike of pressure tens of percent higher , decaying rapidly to a more constant sustained pressure .",
    "this sustained pressure typically decreased by a few percent during the laser pulse .",
    "the eos used exhibited simple , concave behavior , so the decaying pressure in the spike and the plateau was able to catch up and erode the higher pressure states ahead , reducing the shock pressure monotonically as it propagated through the material .",
    "after the end of the pulse , the ablation pressure fell rapidly , and a rarefaction wave propagated into the shocked material , releasing the pressure .",
    "for the thickness and pulse duration chosen , and over the irradiance range considered , the shock reached the rear surface of the plastic before the rarefaction caught up , so a second rarefaction wave from the rear surface also propagated into the material .",

    "laser and thermal radiation penetrates the material much more slowly than the shock wave passes through , so there is a region of compressed material heated only by the passage of the shock between the ablation surface and the undisturbed material ahead of the shock .",
    "it is important to know the rate at which material is ablated , to ensure that the ablator is thick enough for a laser pulse of given irradiance and duration .",
    "the ablation rate was extracted from the simulations by observing the time of first outward motion of points in the material . for convenience in choosing a thickness of ablator ,",

    "it was found previously @xcite that pressures induced in the condensed region were fairly insensitive to the details of the plasma eos .",
    "the sensitivity was investigated here by performing equivalent sets of simulations using the eos and opacity for parylene - c from the sesame library : ( tables 7771 and 17620 ) @xcite , and also polystyrene ( tables 7590 and 17593 ) @xcite .",
    "the two parylene models gave the same ablation pressure to within 1 - 2% , and the shock speeds were almost identical .",
    "the polystyrene model gave a smaller initial pressure spike and a sustained pressure that was up to several percent lower , but with less of a decrease over the pulse duration and hence a slower decay as it propagated through the plastic .",

    "experimentally , it has been found that some laser light may be transmitted through the plastic coating before the opaque plasma sheath forms , inducing earlier ablation of the sample material behind by a small amount of the laser energy .",
    "this early transmission was not predicted in the radiation hydrodynamics simulations , which ( as is common ) did not include an adequate model of the line opacity and breakdown of the plastic .",
    "a palliative is to deposit a thin , metal flashing on the surface of the plastic to prevent early transmission . a typical flashing is 100 nm of al , though",
    "other metals have been used @xcite .",
    "the al layer potentially has an effect on the ablation pressure , apart from the palliative effect .",

    "the undisturbed material extends from 0 to 50@xmath36 m , and the laser drive impinges from the left . ]    there is also a potential effect from x - ray preheating of the sample , induced by k - shell radiation from the ablator or flashing .",
    "x - ray preheating is very sensitive to intensity variations in the laser beam , as x - ray yield is highly non - linear in laser irradiance @xcite .",
    "the fluence of preheating x - rays is therefore very sensitive to the beam quality of the specific laser system , including any phase plate used to reduce large - scale intensity variations .",
    "the degree of x - ray heating also depends on the opacity of the sample material . experimental evidence and theoretical predictions for x - ray preheating in such experiments",
    "is mixed : simulations have indicated that preheating may be significant in our regime of interest @xcite , but whereas experiments have shown little or no preheating @xcite . while preheating is a potential concern when the initial temperature of the sample is important ,",
    "it has a much smaller effect on wave interactions caused by the presence of the ablator , so we do not consider it further in the present work .    at the end of the laser pulse ,",
    "the pressure at the ablation surface drops rapidly as the ablation plume expands and cools .",
    "until two - dimensional expansion takes effect , the pressure gradient in the ablation plume is inversely proportional to the pulse length , so the rate at which the pressure falls is inversely proportional to the pulse length .",
    "the ablation pressure can be made constant in time by adjusting the temporal shape of the laser pulse .",
    "many , though not all , large laser systems allow the power history to be controlled , so a desired temporal shape can be delivered to some finite level of precision . on lasers with large numbers of beams but a simple shape from each ( such as a constant power ) ,",
    "a smooth temporal shape can be approximated by altering the energy and relative timing of the beams .",
    "the principle of pulse shaping for constant ablation pressure was demonstrated for parylene - n ablators by performing simulations in which the laser irradiance was adjusted .",
    "these simulations were performed for a laser pulse where the time - dependent irradiance was represented in tabular form , with table entries at the start and end of the pulse of equal value for a constant irradiance .",
    "the procedure followed was first to adjust the irradiance at the end of the pulse , giving a linear ramp starting at the initial irradiance , and then to add extra points between the first and last and change their values to remove shorter time scale variations in pressure .",
    "the sustained ablation pressure was made constant by ramping the irradiance up in time , and the initial pressure spike was removed by reducing the irradiance early in time and following a more gentle approach to the main part of the pulse .",
    "this procedure was demonstrated previously for direct ablation of be @xcite .",
    "calculationally , it was possible to make the induced pressure constant to any desired precision by adjusting the laser irradiance history ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pulseshape ] ) . for irradiances from 0.1 to 10pw / m@xmath37 ,",
    "the ramp was 10 - 30%  of the mean irradiance .    . ]",
    "when the ablator is in contact with a sample , the impedance mismatch between the ablator and the sample lead to wave interactions which change the pressure history in the ablator and may lead to multiple waves in the sample . in most cases of interest , the sample has a higher shock impedance than the plastic ablator , so the ablation - induced shock reflects a shock from the interface between the ablator and the sample .    in this discussion of wave interactions ,",
    "we consider a simplified situation where the laser irradiance history has been adjusted to give a constant drive pressure in the ablator , which will induce a constant initial shock pressure in the sample .",
    "early in the laser pulse , an ablation - driven shock is induced , driving a transmitted shock in the sample and a reflected shock in the ablator . if the laser pulse is long enough , when the reflected shock reaches the ablation surface , double - shocked ablator material is then ablated , resulting in an ablation pressure that is slightly higher than before , but generally lower than the double - shocked pressure .",

    "the ablation - driven shock travels at a speed @xmath44 and compresses the ablator to a mass density @xmath45 , ablating material at a rate @xmath41 with respect to the uncompressed ablator ( the quantity calculated above ) or @xmath46 of the compressed ablator . the shock reflected from the sample",
    "back through the ablator travels at a speed @xmath47 and compresses the ablator further to a mass density @xmath48 . in this state , the speed of sound is @xmath49 : this is the speed of the head of the ablation surface rarefaction . for an ablator of initial , uncompressed thickness @xmath50 , the transit time of the initial ablation shock is @xmath51 : this is the time that loading starts in the sample after the start of the laser pulse .",
    "the transit time of the reflected shock is @xmath52 the optimum laser pulse length is @xmath53 , so the ablator drive speed is @xmath54 the residual thickness of ablator when the reflected shock reaches the ablation surface is @xmath55\\frac{\\rho_a}{\\rho_r},\\ ] ] so the transit time of the ablation surface release is @xmath56 the time for which the initial pressure is applied to the sample is thus @xmath57 so the load duration factor is @xmath58    if the sound speed in the ablation shocked state is @xmath59 , traveling through the compressed ablator , the minimum pulse length for the peak pressure to reach the sample can be found by calculating the point in the ablator at which the head of a release wave at the end of the laser pulse would catch up with the ablation shock .",
    "the minimum time is proportional to the sample thickness , so an effective ` catch - up speed ' can be defined for a given ablation pressure : @xmath60 where @xmath44 , @xmath59 , and @xmath45 are all in the principal hugoniot state for the ablator at the ablation pressure . for a given laser pulse duration @xmath61 , the maximum depth in the ablator",
    "before the ablation shock starts to decay is then @xmath62 .",
    "this calculation can also be used to calculate the maximum sample thickness for a supported shock in experiments where the sample itself is ablated @xcite . for an ablator of given thickness @xmath63 , the minimum laser pulse duration @xmath64 . for laser pulse durations between this and @xmath65 ,",
    "the duration of the peak pressure pulse applied to the sample is @xmath66    as a planar loading or unloading wave propagates through a sample , release waves from the edge will usually erode the shocked region .",
    "the head of the release wave initiated by any lateral variation in the material or loading conditions is an expanding circle with respect to the shocked material ( fig .",
    "[ fig : latrel ] ) : a cylinder or torus in two - dimensional plane or axisymmetric geometry respectively .",
    "the lateral variation in a projectile impact experiment is the edge of the projectile on the impact surface ; for laser ablation it is the edge of the focal spot  though unlike a projectile impact , the pressure does not release to zero because the ablation of laterally - released material may induce a pressure almost as high as that from the shock - compressed ablator .",
    "the speed of sound in the shocked region is greater than the shock speed , so the release wave erodes the shock .",
    "the hydrodynamic flow is self - similar , so the erosion of the shock by the release wave can be characterized by the angle @xmath67 at which the planar region of the shock is eroded .",
    "@xmath67 is often assumed to be @xmath68 , but this is not generally the case . as with the catch - up speed , these angles can be calculated given the sound speed on the principal hugoniot @xmath59 , by considering the propagation of a disturbance from the edge of the planar shock region , traveling at @xmath59 , across material moving with the particle speed @xmath69 parallel with the shock , and the resulting speed of the disturbance as it moves across successive positions of the shock itself : @xmath70 an equivalent analysis has been used previously to measure the sound speed on the hugoniot @xcite . for a circular laser spot of diameter @xmath71 ,",
    "the diameter of the region of the sample initially subjected to the maximum shock pressure is @xmath72 where @xmath63 is the thickness of the ablator .",
    "subsequent release depends also on the sound and particle speed in the double - shocked ablator material .",
    "the same analysis , using the hugoniot state in the sample , can be used to predict the lateral erosion of the shock in the sample itself .",
    "the edge release angle is important when designing experiments to study phenomena at the leading edge of the shock . for experiments on release from the shocked state , including tensile damage ,",
    "an important design parameter is the scale rate at which lateral release propagates radially through the shocked material , @xmath73 .",
    "may be greater or less than one .",
    "a steady shock is always subsonic with respect to the flow behind .",
    "however , with respect to the shocked material , the shock moves at @xmath74 , which does not exclude @xmath75 . ]",
    "the ablator drive speed , load duration factor , catch - up speed , edge angle , and lateral release ratio were calculated using a generalized shock dynamics algorithm to determine the principal and secondary hugoniot states @xcite , using the same eos as above ( figs  [ fig : drivespeeds ] to [ fig : latsonicity ] ) . as was found previously for direct ablation of metals @xcite ,",
    "the catch - up speed exhibited a minimum value around the bulk modulus of the ablated material : at the minimum , the ablator thickness should be smallest for a given laser pulse duration .",
    "the ratio @xmath73 was greater than 3 for all relevant pressures , and rose past 10 for ablation pressures above 40gpa : lateral release in the ablator may be a concern in experiments with thick ablators , though the pressure may not drop rapidly once release starts as it is sustained by the ablation .",
    "radiation hydrodynamics simulations were performed of the integrated system , with consistent results for the duration of the peak shock state in the sample . it should be noted that these quantities depend on material properties in states significantly off the principal shock hugoniot of the ablator .",
    "the hydrodynamic relations above are valid so long as radiation and charged particle transport are not significant within the compressed ablator or the sample .",
    "the radiation hydrodynamics simulations indicated that radiation transport is unlikely to be significant in this regime ; they did not include electron transport . for ablatively driven experiments on a range of materials at a range of shock states , a wide range of off - hugoniot states may be involved .",
    "these properties are often not known at all accurately from experimental measurements .",
    "it would be more efficient to use experimental measurements to validate and adjust wide - ranging theoretical models , rather than attempting to measure the properties of the ablator so generally .",
    "experiments should include the principal hugoniot of the ablator , and also off - hugoniot states induced by , for example , reflected shocks from high - density samples .",
    "these data could be acquired using laser loading experiments with velocimetry measurements .",
    "transparent samples would allow the velocity history to be measured at the interface .",
    "whether transparent or opaque , the samples should be thick enough to prevent release waves from their free surface from perturbing the states inside the ablator , which would complicate the experiments .",
    "measurements would include the amplitude and duration of the shock in the sample .",
    "the sensitivity of ablation pressure in ch - based plastic ablators to uncertainties in equation of state or composition was predicted to be 5 - 10% , which is small compared with typical uncertainties in laser irradiance . a laser pulse of constant irradiance",
    "was predicted to induce an ablation pressure that decreased by several percent per nanosecond , but was significantly more constant than the pressure history induced by direct ablation of metal samples .",
    "a simple relationship between laser irradiance and shock pressure was deduced from the simulations , valid for irradiances from 0.1 - 100pw / m@xmath37 .",
    "al flashing , used to prevent early - time shine - through , was predicted to make at most a few percent difference in loading history once dielectric breakdown had occurred , increasing the pressure and flattening the pressure history at lower irradiances .",
    "it was demonstrated that the irradiance history can be adjusted to produce a more constant pressure history .",
    "the impedance mismatch between plastic ablators and metal samples induces a stronger transmitted shock in the sample , by a factor of around 1.8 for al and 2.5 for cu .",
    "the shock reflected into the ablator interacts with the ablation surface to produce a stepped pressure history in the sample , the pressure reducing to closer to the ablation pressure .",
    "this composite loading history should be taken into account when designing and interpreting material dynamics experiments .",
    "the shock pressure is applied to the sample for a significantly shorter time than the laser pulse duration , because the successive waves in the ablator are faster than the initial ablation - driven shock .",
    "a compact method was found for representing the optimum ablator thickness for a given laser pulse duration ( or vice versa ) , as an effective speed .",
    "a similar method was found to represent the relationship between the laser pulse duration and the duration of the initial , peak pressure pulse applied to the sample .",
