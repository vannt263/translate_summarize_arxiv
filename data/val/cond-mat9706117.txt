    "do they form stable or metastable states ?",
    "are they stable only at high temperatures ? is the stability due to energetic or due to entropic reasons ? the random tiling model of quasicrystals is an abstraction which deals with rigid tiles , thereby neglecting thermal fluctuations and the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the only dynamic process is the local rearrangement of tiles , called `` flips '' , `` umklapps '' , `` zipper '' moves , depending on the type of tiles and symmetries .",
    "the random tiling model has been proposed by elser  @xcite and has been studied intensively in recent years .",

    "the hypersurface fluctuates around an average hyperplane @xmath7 .",
    "the constant quantity @xmath8 is called `` global phason strain '' and describes the deviation of the slope of the average hyperplane @xmath9 from the slope of the physical space . in the case of exact icosahedral symmetry the average hyperplane is running parallel to the physical space and thus @xmath10 .",
    "+ long - wavelength deviations from the hypersurface are denoted as `` phason fluctuations '' and are described in a continuum picture by a phason strain tensor @xmath11 according to henley  @xcite the fluctuations are governed by a free energy depending quadratically on the phason strain : @xmath12 the dimension @xmath13 of physical space is equal to three for icosahedral quasicrystals .    the present work deals with the three - dimensional ammann - kramer - penrose tiling and its randomizations .",
    "this tiling consists of two different elementary cells , the `` oblate '' and `` prolate '' rhombohedron .",

    "the tiling exhibits , among others , a vertex representing lattice points where two prolate and two oblate rhombohedra meet .",
    "it is denoted `` simpleton vertex '' .",
    "the outer shape of the cells , which touch this vertex , is a rhombic dodecahedron .",
    "if the dodecahedron is kept fixed , two possibilities exist to fill it with tiles .",
    "the exchange of one configuration by the other is a `` flip '' .",
    "the lattice point jumps a distance which is 0.650 of the edge length of the rhombohedra ( fig .",

    "the number of rhombohedra adjacent to a lattice point in an icosahedral quasilattice varies from 4 to 20 , the number of edges from 4 to 12 .",
    "there are 24 `` canonical '' or `` allowed '' vertices , but 5450 vertices may occur in a random tiling .",
    "vertices where two identical rhombohedra meet are called `` crystallographic '' . without them the number of vertices is reduced to 360  @xcite .    in the two - dimensional penrose tiling each flip generates non - canonical vertices . there",
    "the knowledge of the vertices suffices to distinguish between ideal and random tilings .",
    "this statement is not valid in three dimensions .",
    "there are some flips possible in the rhombohedra tiling which only change the frequency of vertices without introducing forbidden ones .",
    "if the degree of randomization has reached a certain level the number of forbidden vertices is going to rise rapidly .",
    "the frequency of the simpleton is 23.61% in the ideal rhombohedra tiling .",
    "the simpletons are arranged in two - dimensional layers perpendicular to the two - fold symmetry axis . due to the two possibilities to pack the rhombohedra into the simpleton there are two positions for the internal lattice point .",
    "the positions may be called `` up '' and `` down '' and attributed a spin value @xmath25 . in the ideal rhombohedra tiling all the spins in a certain layer carry spin + 1 or 1 .",
    "dotera and steinhardt  @xcite have defined a sheet magnetization of value 1 using a proper summation rule . in",
    "a random tiling the sheets also exist , but the magnetization is reduced since the spins in one layer are not all aligned .",
    "the collection of all sheets can therefore be regarded as a two - dimensional ising model with a variable number of spins .",
    "there is , however , no interaction leading to an ising hamiltonian .",

    "this equation replaces the more cumbersome definition used in  @xcite .      in the three - dimensional icosahedral rhombohedra tiling special tube structures , denoted",
    "`` worms '' , exist along two - fold axes ( fig .  [ worm ] ) .",
    "they are formed of stacks of rhombohedra which have one type of face in common , perpendicular to the two - fold axis .",

    "@xmath32 is proportional to the area of the intersection plane at @xmath30 through the triacontahedral acceptance domain in the ideal tiling , since the density of points is 1 in the domain and 0 outside .    for random tilings we have to use another definition .",

    "the values of @xmath28 are between 0 and a maximal value for five - fold and three - fold directions ( fig .",
    "[ planid ] ) . in the five - fold case",
    "the function has a constant plateau since the corners of the intersection polygon are formed by edges of the triacontahedron perpendicular to the plane . in the two - fold case the minimal value of @xmath28 is greater than zero , since the smallest intersection polygons coincide with the surface - rhombi of the triacontahedron parallel to the intersection plane . to obtain the average density of atoms in a plane one has to calculate the mean value of the area of the intersection polygons .",
    "it is equivalent to the volume of the triacontahedron divided by the diameter @xmath36 of the triacontahedron along the direction @xmath29 .",
    "then the mean value of the plane density is : @xmath37    for channeling experiments one is interested in the frequency @xmath38 of planes perpendicular to @xmath29 with a plane density @xmath39 in the interval @xmath40 . wherever the intersection function @xmath41 is flat , there are many @xmath42 $ ] values for @xmath39 inside of @xmath40 . if the slope is large , the number of planes with this density is small .",

    "since the triacontahedron is a convex polyhedron and centrosymmetric , the function @xmath28 is monotonously growing in one half of the interval @xmath44 and monotonously decreasing in the other .",

    "similarly as the plane structures one also finds chains in the quasicrystal .",

    "it decreases monotonously in radial direction from the center of the interface @xmath60 to the boundaries .",
    "the frequency function may be derived analytically in the following way : the origins of the coordinate @xmath30 parallel to the symmetry axis @xmath61 and of the coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the plane perpenticular to @xmath61 are chosen in such a way that it coincides with the projection of the center of the triacontahedron .",

    "strandburg  @xcite has introduced a similar energy measure .",

    "we test whether the energetic equidistribution postulated in the random tiling model is justificable .",

    "it turns out that different random tiling samples are indeed equivalent with respect to the pair interactions , since the radial distribution function is nearly unchanged for the short distances ( where the contibution to the potential energy would be strong ) , and at larger distances the pair potential is zero due to the cutoff distance .",
    "simpleton flips directed in their frequency by the monte - carlo method allow the generation of equilibrium configurations at a given temperature .",
    "the randomization of the quasilattice is realized by a sequence of such flips which usually are associated with a change in energy .",

    "it is the only one known that produces equilibrium ensembles .",
    "a simpleton flip does not generate or destroy tiles , it only rearranges them .",

    "if it increases , it is performed with a probability of @xmath99 .    during the flips",
    "the lattice points change their positions and the vertices their frequency .",
    "the simpleton vertex itself , for example , occurs with a frequency of 23.61% in the ideal tiling .",
    "this value decreases to a temperature dependent equilibrium value during the initial phase of a simulation . at @xmath100 the equilibrium frequency of the simpleton vertex",
    "is about 17.5% .",
    "quasicrystals do not permit periodic boundary conditions . hence one has to work with a finite patch of a quasicrystal .",
    "then there are two possibilities to deal with the surface : either keep it fixed ( fixed boundaries ) or identify opposite sides ( periodic approximants ) .    in the case of fixed boundaries the surface lattice points are not allowed to move . in approximants",
    "all lattice points are mobile .",
    "therefore the configuration entropy per lattice point with fixed boundaries is smaller than the entropy of approximants .",
    "the configuration entropy of the approximant , on the other hand , differs only slightly from the value of the ideal tiling .",
    "the frequency of vertices also is not much different between an ideal quasicrystal and an approximant tiling .",
    "the frequency of the simpleton , however , in patches with fixed boundaries may grow to up to 30% of that of the bulk vertices . for a discussion of the entropy dependence on boundary conditions see  @xcite .",
    "periodic approximants show matching rule violations already in the ground state .",
    "they exhibit a periodic superstructure and for very small samples a remarkable deviation of the vertex frequencies .",
    "the intrinsic global phason strain changes the flip diffusion properties at low temperatures as the ground state phasons generate zero energy modes .",
    "the sheet magnetization ( see sec .  [ sheetmag ] ) in the case of a cubic approximant is useful only for the three two - fold directions parallel to the cubic cell axis .",

    "a new method to generate random tilings ( especially non - equilibrium configurations ) is the successive addition of tiles to the tube and slab structures within a finite region .    for this method",
    "fixed boundaries are used .",

    ". this can be e.g.  a piece of an ideal tiling or a single unit cell of a periodic approximant .",
    "all interior quasilattice points are removed .",
    "then the volume is refilled in a systematic way without gaps and overlaps of the tiles .",
    "since we start with an existing patch ( microstate ) , it is certain that tilings of this surface must exist .",
    "the hollow volume represents the macrostate , the different possibilities to fill it are the microstates .",
    "the algorithm is started by selecting one five - fold direction ( fig .",

    "we will now shortly sketch how the method works .",
    "the procedure can be broken up into two parts : filling the two - dimensional slabs , which is equivalent to performing the construction for generalized penrose tilings , and then filling the space between the slabs .",
    "first of all we will explain how to proceed in two dimensions . in the penrose tiling",
    "there are five sets of one - dimensional rows of rhombi with one type of edge in common .",
    "the average direction of the sets is perpendicular to the tiling vector directions . in the hollow volume",
    "we start with one of the directions and generate the rows one by one .",
    "the fixed surface determines the starting and terminating position of the rows ( by the edges parallel to the selected tiling vector ) . the difference vector ( in higher dimensional coordinates ) between initial and final point",
    "determines the number of tiles of each type in that row uniquely ( by the coordinate components ) .",
    "we are only free to choose the sequential arrangement of the tiles .",
    "there are , however , restrictions : the second pair of edges of each rhombus must also fit into the configuration .",
    "this means that the difference vector between the rhombus and the respective edge on the surface of a neighbouring row must be fillable with rhombi .",

    "there is no divergence of the maximum of @xmath77 .",
    "the reason may be that the intrinsic divergence of the specific heat with sample size , if any , is very weak .",
    "for further insight we calculated the sheet magnetization @xmath115 and the susceptibility @xmath122 since the latter shows a much more pronounced divergence behaviour .    in the samples of class four",

    "the binder order parameter does not lead to a decision either , since there is no clear intersection point visible ( fig .",
    "[ bop ] ) .",
    "the trend of @xmath108 changes at @xmath146 , similar to the magnetization behaviour .",
    "the most probable intersection point is between @xmath147 and 0.4 if it exists .",
    "but the tendency of @xmath141 with @xmath129 and the behaviour of @xmath108 indicate that a phase transition is much more likely to occur at @xmath84 .",
    "the mean square displacement @xmath148 grows linearly with time @xmath149 , indicating a normal diffusion behaviour and allowing the calculation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath107 . at temperatures lower than @xmath150 the extrapolation is difficult due to large fluctuations .",
    "@xmath107 becomes unmeasurably small below @xmath151 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient forms a plateau at @xmath152 for @xmath153 in the arrhenius plot ( fig .",
    "[ diffcoedd ] ) .",
    "there may be several reasons for this behaviour :    first , there are energy barriers between different tiling configurations due to the harmonic energy measure , which at low temperatures lower the mobility of lattice points for flips of higher energy . in the range of the plateau the probability for a flip",
    "only occasionally suffices to overcome the barriers which play no role at high temperatures .",
    "second , a phase transition may occur which changes the slope in the arrhenius plot .",
    "ghler has also observed a change of the slope in case of the energy measure with the alternation condition which turns out to be a phase transition since other response functions like the susceptibility and the specific heat definitely yielded a divergence at the same temperature .",
    "last , there is an explanation which comes from the fact that the number of flippable lattice points ( number of simpletons ) changes with temperature . we can distinguish four ranges :    1 .",
    "the number of simpletons is about 23% in the range @xmath154 .",
    "2 .   in the range",
    "@xmath155 we find a nearly logarithmic decrease of the number of simpletons .",
    "the plateau of @xmath130 is clearly seen here .",
    "3 .   in the range @xmath156 the approach of the frequency of the simpleton to a constant value leads to an increase of the negative slope of @xmath130 .",
    "4 .   above @xmath157",
    "the number of simpletons is constant at @xmath158 .    in the approximants the behaviour of @xmath107(@xmath71 )",
    "is obscured to some degree by zero energy modes caused by periodic boundaries .",
    "these modes become less and less important at larger sizes , but suppress the plateau for small sample sizes .    within the framework of the random tiling model we have studied only flip diffusion .",
    "no other diffusion mechanism , in particular vacancy diffusion , can be introduced in this way .",
    "the latter mechanism is expected to be the dominant diffusion process at least above 600@xmath159c , but there are indications that the new mechanism plays a rle below that temperature  @xcite .",
    "structure functions have been calculated for samples of type four and size @xmath160 , containing 10336 lattice points , for the primitive monoatomic and the binary decoration  @xcite .",
    "there are only small changes in the radial density function @xmath96 .",
    "the largest differences of the order of 12% occur for bonds between two large atoms , but they are the least significant ones for stability due to their small number .",
    "the energetically most important nearest - neighbour bonds change even less in all cases , since a large portion of them lives _ within _ the rhombohedra and",
    "thus is only transferred to another position by a flip , but the frequency itself does not change .",
    "the differences we observe in the addition tiling are somewhat larger , but still very small .",
    "figure [ rdf ] shows the results for a monatomic sample of size @xmath146 .",
    "the trend of the radial structure factor @xmath118 which corresponds to the fourier - transformation of @xmath96 is similar to that of the radial density function . due the smallness of the sample",
    "there are rather large finite size effects which do not permit a quantitative comparison .",
    "we further observe a very small dependence of the pair energy function ( see eq .  [ pairpot ] ) on size and @xmath71 due to the relation between the pair energy and the pair distribution function .",
    "it is interesting to note that the potential energy of the random tiling ensemble is at @xmath100 about 0.4% lower than for the ideal quasicrystal for a large class of lennard - jones - like potentials , whereas the fluctuations within the random tiling ensemble are of the order of 0.1% . therefore simple pair potentials obviously favour energetical equidistribution , i.  e.  the random tiling model .",
    "the variance behaves roughly linear with respect to @xmath105 which is obvious if one compares their definition in eqs .",
    "[ vareq ] and [ eneq ] .",
    "the variance therefore shows a similar behaviour as the internal energy .",
    "the change in the statistics of the vertices with temperature is much more important , as we have seen in the discussion of the diffusion behaviour and in the rle of the simpleton frequency in sec  [ sdc ] .",
    "the changes of the vertex frequencies ( notation as in  @xcite ) can be summed up as follows :    1 .",
    "the simpleton vertex 1 ( 452 ) decreases from 23.61% to 17.5% .",

    "the sum of frequencies of vertex 1 and vertex 2 is roughly constant .",
    "the forbidden vertices ( all together ) increase from 0% to more then 40% .",
    "the vertex with the highest symmetry where 20 prolate rhombohedra meet ( vertex 24 , in  @xcite also called twelve - fold sites ) decreases in frequency from 1.2% close to extinction .",
    "the addition tilings show a strong deviation from the ideal distribution .",
    "for the sizes @xmath153 we obtain for the simpleton frequencies : 16.7 % , 15.0 % , 12.2 % , and for the frequencies of the forbidden vertices : 36.3 % , 43.2  % and 55.3% , respectively .",

    "it is not clear whether it diverges .",

    "it should vanish without an intermediate minimum .",
    "the susceptibility diverges slowly , the maximum shifts to smaller temperatures .",
    "the binder order parameter does not exhibit a unique intersection point .",
    "we assume that the transition temperature is finite , hence the random tiling transition could be analogous to the transition in a two - dimensional ising ferromagnet .",
    "3 .   the self - diffusion coefficient displays a plateau in the central temperature range indicating energy barriers for certain flips due to the harmonic energy measure . on the other hand there exist correlations between the temperature dependence of the self - diffusion coefficient and the frequencies of simpletons per lattice point .",
    "the arrhenius plot is deviating strongly from that assumed by kalugin and katz  @xcite : where these authors are plotting a steep increase , we are observing the plateau .",
    "there are zero energy modes due to periodic boundary conditions , which lead to a suppression of the plateau for small approximants .",
