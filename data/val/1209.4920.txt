    "despite decades of study , astrophysical jets are still an enigmatic component of our universe . understanding the details of their physics",
    "would advance fields as diverse as star formation , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , galaxy evolution and cluster dynamics .",
    "jets in all of these objects probably share three basic ingredients : a source of energy and particles such as an accretion flow , magnetic fields created or carried inward by the flow , and rotation . however , the exact details of how these elements combine to launch and collimate jets in the observed systems is not at all clear .",
    "black holes are ideal test cases to understand jet physics because of their enormous range in mass , allowing us to study jet dynamics over an equally large range of time - scales . accreting stellar mass black holes in a binary with a companion star ( bhbs ) have jets that can undergo an entire launch and quench cycle on time - scales of months , which is related at least in part to the accretion state of the disc @xcite . in their supermassive cousins , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ,",
    "such transitions would be expected to occur on time - scales of millions to a billion times longer . to assess the extent to which such a mass - scaling operates",
    ", we must have a better understanding of which elements of jet physics persist despite a dramatic range of environment and scales .",
    "one key feature of jets regardless of source seems to be their ability to accelerate particles to highly relativistic energy .",
    "we observe the outcome of these accelerated particles directly via optically thin synchrotron emission in , e.g. , agn @xcite and in bhbs @xcite .",
    "when the jets are compact enough to become self - absorbed , the superposition of many synchrotron - emitting components along the length of the jet leads to a flat or slightly inverted total spectrum @xcite until the point where the jet emission becomes entirely optically thin . at this point",
    "the spectral index will steepen dramatically to @xmath0 typically , where @xmath1 is defined such that @xmath2 .",
    "this break in the spectrum can be physically associated with the most compact region in the jets where particle acceleration is present . in low - luminosity agn jets",
    "this break typically occurs in the ghz range @xcite , and if jets are self - similar across the black hole mass range , in bhbs such a break would be predicted to occur in the infrared ( ir ) bands . because the spectral break also indicates the total radiative power of the jets , and plays a key role in driving mass - scaling predictions such as the fundamental plane of black hole accretion , it is a pivotal parameter linking the inner jets ( and assumedly conditions near their launch point ) to the outer jets associated with strong radio through ir emission .",
    "deriving this link and overall jets structure in an mhd - consistent way is the focus of this paper .",
    "constraints on the location of the jet break can come from both observations as well as from spectral fitting . because the optical / ir ( oir ) bands are often dominated by a stellar companion or the accretion disc , the optically thick - to - thin break has been observed explicitly in only one bhb so far , gx  339 - 4 ( @xcite",
    "; see also @xcite for a similar break for neutron stars ) , and has been indirectly constrained for cyg  x-1 based on recent mir observations @xcite .",
    "these observations confirm the theoretically predicted break location , and the recent boom in multiwavelength monitoring of many bhbs is leading to new studies of the break and its scaling with luminosity ( russell et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ". the location in frequency of the break can also be rather tightly constrained by fitting multiple spectra of bhbs and agn in states associated with compact jets , which has the advantage of also associating a size scale for the region , and distance from the black hole .",
    "a series of works have consistently found the region of the jet where particle acceleration initiates seems to be offset from the black hole at distances of @xmath3101000@xmath4 , depending on source luminosity , where @xmath5 is the gravitational radius , @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , this zone also should be associated with an offset in the start of the synchrotron core from the black hole in direct imaging .",
    "such a measurement is very difficult to do because of the spatial resolution required .",
    "at least for the jet in m87 , a relatively nearby agn ( @xmath7  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a large supermassive black hole ( @xmath8m@xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* although note this value is twice the mass found in previous studies ) , the offset is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent astrometry for m87 has also shown that the location of the radio core with respect to the black hole is extremely stable over several years @xcite .",
    "a natural explanation for such a region for the start of particle acceleration would be a shock where continual diffusive acceleration occurs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because particles need to be continually accelerated , the shock should be a steady feature within the compact jets .    in self - similar , axisymmetric mhd flows ,",
    "the bulk flows can be accelerated through several singular points in order : the modified slow point ( msp ) , the alfvn point ( ap ) , and the modified fast point ( mfp ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bp82 ) . at the mfp",
    ", the velocity of the flow greatly exceeds the fast magnetosonic speed , which is the fastest that signals in the jet can travel . thus beyond the mfp the flow is causally disconnected from the flow closer to the central object , allowing disruptions such as shocks to form . a stable location for the mfp in a given flow would therefore provide a natural explanation for a steady feature associated with particle acceleration .",
    "this location could , however , be a function of mass and accretion power and vary from source to source within a certain range . in the models mentioned above , the shock location is a fitted free parameter that suggestively falls into the same range for a variety of sources .",
    "however , to understand if this is a physically meaningful result , we should ideally be able to show that this location corresponds to a feature that can be derived self - consistently within a theoretical framework , and tied to conditions at the jet launch point .",
    "the earlier modes are based on a hydrodynamical ( hd ) velocity profile , and thus do not invoke the role of magnetic fields other than as a global parameter .",
    "however , if we move to a mhd framework , we can derive the exact location of the mfp ( and assumedly the shock ) based on boundary conditions defined by the launch point of the jets , and then test if the theory provides the correct scalings as observed , and as seem to be driving the fundamental plane .    in this paper",
    "we take a semi - analytical approach to derive new flow solutions ( a new jet model ) with the explicit aim of exploring the conditions for formation of the mfp , by solving the equations of relativistic mhd under the assumptions of self - similarity and axisymmetry .",
    "these assumptions greatly simplify the equations describing the jets , and are consistent with the results of numerical mhd simulations , which almost always produce a magnetic field line geometry near the launch point that is remarkably self - similar and axisymmetric ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 and fig .  11 in",
    "we need to make one further approximation to construct our solutions : in order to link the properties of the mfp to the conditions at the base of the jet , we need to solve for the ap and msp in a regime which could potentially be very close to the black hole where gravity becomes important . the msp is a natural point to associate with the launch region of the jets , similar to the sonic nozzle in hydrodynamical flows , and is thus also the place where conditions could eventually be matched to the accretion inflow , such as a magnetic corona or radiatively - inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , gravity will play a significant role so close to the black hole ; therefore , it also needs to be included in order to correctly derive and cross the msp .",
    "_ until now no semi - analytical formalism has been developed to describe a relativistic flow passing through all three singular points , because in a relativistic framework gravity is not self - similar_. therefore in this paper , in order to accomplish this connection , we apply a bridging solution between our previous relativistic self - similar flow model without gravity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pmm10 ) , based on the framework for self - similar flow laid out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vk03 ) ) , which is also valid in the non - relativistic limit ( again without gravity ) , and a non - relativistic flow model that is valid close to the black hole and that does include the effects of gravity self - consistently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vtst00 ) .",
    "the transition from the non - relativistic flow with gravity to our relativistic flow without gravity from pmm10 occurs sufficiently far from the black hole that gravitational effects are no longer important .",
    "the bridging of these two solutions will not describe all possible gravitational fields and velocities , but the range of solutions is wide enough to be applicable to many observed sources , which is the goal of this project . specifically , within a cylindrical region constituting a `` flux tube '' , that can be associated with the observable `` sheath '' of compact jets , we demonstrate that the deviations from self - similarity when gravity is present are very small . within this scenario , we present relativistic mhd solutions that cross all three singular points , allowing us to derive the location of the shock self - consistently from boundary conditions at the base of the jet and to begin to test how well such a model fares against physical sources .",
    "gravity is treated in the weak ( newtonian ) limit , and in this paper we have opted for a paczysky - wiita ( pseudo - newtonian ) augmentation since some of our solutions approach the schwarzschild radius , where general relativistic effects begin to be important .",
    "no other gr correction terms , nor black hole spin , is treated at this time .    in  2 we present details of the bridging formalism . in ",
    "3 we use the new formalism to obtain solutions crossing the msp , ap , and mfp and describe their properties .",
    "we also show the effects that changing the model parameters have on the location of the msp and mfp . in",
    " 4 we present an in - depth discussion of our model and results , and we draw our conclusions in  5 .",
    "in order to tie the conditions at the start of the particle acceleration region to the conditions at the base of the jet , we need to have a full description of a hot , relativistic flow . because close to the central object gravity is as important as temperature and the magnetic field strength ,",
    "the gravitational potential must be taken into account in order to be able to describe the jet in this region .",
    "because this region is generally subrelativistic or mildly relativistic , we start with a solution that includes gravity in a non - relativistic flow .",
    "far from the black hole the flow will be relativistic , but gravity will no longer be important in the solution , so we can use the equations derived in pmm10 to describe this flow .",
    "we then seek solutions that satisfy both the relativistic flow without gravity and the non - relativistic flow with gravity at opposite ends of the jet .      in the framework of self - similar relativistic mhd",
    ", we find that jets in our solutions are accelerated in the following way : starting from the base of the flow , the initial bulk acceleration is provided through thermal pressure gradients by means of sound waves by the very hot particles surrounding the central object .",
    "when the flow exceeds the sound speed , this mechanism becomes inefficient , and acceleration due to the centrifugal force of the rotating magnetic field by means of alfvn waves takes over . after the flow surpasses the alfvn speed , magnetic pressure becomes the dominant mechanism .",
    "when the flow velocity increases beyond the fast magnetosonic speed , the final boost is given by the pinching of the magnetic field .",
    "if at this point the flow overcollimates , a shock may form , which can accelerate the particles into the observed power - law distributions , thus constituting the start of the particle acceleration region .    in prior work ( pmm10 )",
    "we were unable to probe the region where the initial bulk acceleration occurs due to the absence of gravity in our formalism .",
    "however , the singular msp can be produced only by the inward gravitational force balancing the outward magnetic and thermal pressure forces .",
    "thus by including gravity we can describe the jet from very close to the central object to the first instance of overcollimation , providing the connection between the conditions at these two points . we will discuss how we deal with the issues regarding self - similarity in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the matching of two flow solutions valid in different regimes of parameter or physical space is a common technique in physics .",
    "some techniques simply solve the two different equations in the different regimes and then match the solutions at a single ( and arbitrary ) point .",
    "such bridging solutions are only @xmath11-continuous , meaning its derivative is not a continuous function .",
    "other methods may involve spline fitting the two solutions together in a finite _ bridging region_. in this case , the two solutions are valid in each of their respective regimes , but in the bridging region neither is strictly valid .",
    "instead , the spline fit is an approximation of the transition between the two solutions , and it is @xmath12-continuous or better .    our method for bridging the non - relativistic vtst00 mhd wind equation with gravity and the relativistic vk03 one without gravity is similar to the above approaches .",
    "that is , when gravitational forces are important and the flow non - relativistic , we obtain the vtst00 mhd solution . however , when gravity is no longer important , the flow has the character of the vk03 relativistic solutions , whether it is relativistic or not .",
    "the difference here is that , because of the nearly - identical structures of the vtst00 and vk03 equations , we can perform this task with the construction of a _ single _ wind equation .",
    "the method , then , will be @xmath13-continuous , with all derivatives being continuous functions  a distinct advantage when one is dealing with equations which have singular points through which the solution must pass .",
    "we now give a brief overview of our previous work in pmm10 and describe how we here extend it by bridging it with a non - relativistic formulation including gravity valid close to the black hole .    in pmm10",
    "we combined the bernoulli equation ( describing the forces along a field line ) and the transfield equation ( describing the forces perpendicular to a field line ) , to construct a wind equation , which describes the bulk acceleration of the flow and fully specifies the jet geometry . using this single differential equation , it was possible to obtain jet solutions that crossed an mfp at a finite distance from the origin .",
    "the terms in the wind equation thus obtained using the formalism of vk03 turned out to be almost identical to the terms in the wind equation given in vtst00 .",
    "apart from relativistic corrections to all the corresponding terms , the only difference is the gravity term in the vtst00 wind equation , which is non - relativistic .",
    "if we modify the vk03 wind equation to include gravity , our combined wind equation will reduce exactly to the formalism of vtst00 when relativistic effects apart from gravity are negligible as is the case close to the black hole , while it also reduces exactly to the formalism of vk03 when gravity becomes negligible as is the case far away from the black hole . between these two regimes",
    "the wind equation describes the bridging regime where relativistic effects may begin to dominate the gravitational effects .",
    "since all these regimes are described by one continuous equation , the resulting solution will be a smooth transition between the two regimes .",
    "we prefer this approach over matching the solutions of the two regimes at an arbitrary location in the jet , while trying to satisfy any number of continuity conditions .",
    "since the notation in vtst00 differs from vk03 , we use equations ( 8)(12 ) in vtst00 and equations ( 24 ) in vk03 to translate the notation to that used in the latter .",
    "this conversion also provides the relativistic corrections to the gravitational mass .",
    "using this relativistic velocity in the definition of the gravity term in vtst00 yields a relativistic form of the gravity term , allowing us to include it into the vk03 wind equation .",
    "the term by term comparison of the two wind equations ensures that we use the proper scaling .",
    "since some of our solutions get very close to the central black hole , we adapted the gravity term to include a pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "after these steps ( see appendix [ appendix : gravity ] ) the gravity term has the following form : @xmath14^{-1 } , \\label{gravityterm}\\ ] ] where the subscript a denotes values at the alfvn point and @xmath15 is the total energy - to - mass flux ratio , @xmath16 is the cylindrical radius distance of the ap scaled to the light cylinder radius , @xmath17 controls the current distribution , @xmath18 is the magnetisation parameter , @xmath19 is the alfvnic mach number , @xmath20 is the cylindrical radius distance scaled to the light cylinder radius , @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the cylindrical radius distance to the ap , @xmath23 is the cylindrical radius distance scaled to the ap , @xmath24 is the gravitational constant , @xmath25 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath26 is the spherical polar angle ( see table [ parameters ] for an overview of all model parameters ) .",
    "the first two fractions consist purely of constants along a given field line , providing the overall scaling .",
    "the third fraction is proportional to @xmath27 ( see [ kappa ] ) , where @xmath28 is the lorentz factor and @xmath29 is the specific relativistic enthalpy ( per baryon mass ) .",
    "the last fraction corresponds to @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the spherical radius and @xmath5 the gravitational radius , and it is this term that represents the pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "several equations besides the wind equation are needed to fully determine a solution , so we have made sure that we take into account all equations in which the gravity term appears . as explained above , gravity , as described by equation , shows up in the numerator of the wind equation . by evaluating the wind equation at the ap ,",
    "we obtain the alfvn regularity condition ( arc , see equation [ arc ] ) , which also depends on gravity .",
    "the arc allows us to calculate the slope of @xmath32 at the ap , @xmath33 , one of the initial parameters of the integration .",
    "the gravity term , as it appears on the right hand side of the arc in vk03 , is given by : @xmath34^{-1}.\\ ] ]    another location in which the gravity term may appear is in the bernoulli equation evaluated at the ap .",
    "this equation is used to determine @xmath35 , another initial parameter of the integration ( see equation [ mu2 ] ) .",
    "however , by evaluating the bernoulli equation of vtst00 at the ap , the gravity term in that equation vanishes there .",
    "so equation ( b5 ) in vk03 is still valid ( see appendix [ bernoulli ] ) .",
    "the transfield equation is incorporated into the wind equation , but not used independently in our calculations , so its dependence on gravity is irrelevant here .    by making these changes",

    "the jet has overcollimated to only 2 per cent of the maximum width , attained just before the mfp .",

    "the kinetic energy first increases at the expense of the thermal energy , signifying initial bulk acceleration due to a gas pressure gradient .",

    "near the black hole , the flow is non - relativistic and the wind equation reduces to the form of vtst00 , which is self - similar . far away from the centre ,",
    "the gravitational energy is negligible and the wind equation assumes the form of vk03 , which is also self - similar .",
    "this combination means that along the integrated field line , the flow transitions from one form of self - similarity to another .",

    "we are free to choose any two parameters , and when using @xmath37 and @xmath52 the field lines do not cross , which is required for self - similarity . because @xmath50 and @xmath51 are therefore constant for all field lines in a region around our reference field line , at the ap self - similarity is exact .",
    "we will define this region , where the field lines do not cross and satisfy self - similarity to within a specified error , as a flux tube .    to show that the non - crossing of field lines holds for a large part of parameter space",

    "this description gives a smooth solution from very near the central object out to the point of overcollimation , using a single partial differential equation to describe all regimes .",
    "this approach produces a workable physical model , allowing us to tie the jet properties to the conditions at the base , and providing a self - consistent determination of the start of the particle acceleration region .    at the same time",
    ", however , the addition of gravity also violates the conditions for self - similarity .",
    "the reason why a single self - similar relativistic flow equation , with gravity , has not been derived is because relativistic flow has one scaling with radius , while gravity has another .",
    "our @xmath13-continuous bridging method has not changed that situation : while describable with a single , continuous equation , our solutions in the relativistic part of the flow without gravity will have different dependencies on the radius parameter @xmath1 than in the non - relativistic part near the black hole that includes gravity .",
    "that is , at least one term in our wind equation will have a dependency on the radius parameter @xmath1 .    in effect",
    "our modified wind equation creates two regions with self - similar geometry , but with different self - similar dependencies in each region . because our focus is on the bulk acceleration and collimation of jets in relativistic sources , our approach to this issue is to choose the self - similarity of the relativistic vk03 equations and restrict the different dependency on @xmath1 to the gravity term only .",
    "that is , our solutions will not be strictly self - similar in the low - speed part of the flow with gravity ( the vtst00 regime ) , but they will be self - similar far from the black hole in the vk03 regime ( see fig .",
    "[ selfsimilarity ] ) .",
    "this highlights another advantage of this approach : since the gravity term is an algebraic one only ( not involving any derivatives of the flow parameters with respect to either radius or polar angle ) , all the physical radial and angular dependence of the original equations will be preserved .",
    "the different self - similarities within a single solution is not unique to our approach ; it will be true of any method that attempts to bridge self - similar solutions with and without gravity . in this",
    "regard , interpretation of the solutions will be an important aspect of this study .",
    "there are two main issues to consider .",
    "first , while accretion discs and jets may have a self - similar character , both simulations and observations show that their activity is concentrated in specific regions .",
    "for example , much of the accretion , and therefore jet , power is generated near the disc inner edge . and features like the one we seek ( a strong collimation shock in the flow ) will occur primarily at a specific point in the jet , and be observed as such , rather than being spread over a large range in radius . therefore , we shall concentrate on only one bundle ( ` flux tube ' ) of magnetic field and stream lines and assume that this flux tube is anchored near the disc inner edge and that it passes through the most important features of the jet .",
    "this will limit the range in @xmath1 in which we are interested .",
    "second , in order that the solutions remain reasonably self - similar - like , we shall choose solutions in which the field lines do not cross within that flux tube . by choosing a specific combination of the free parameters to fit a solution with three singular points , the field lines around our reference field line",
    "behave well .",
    "we have found that selecting @xmath37 and @xmath52 as fitting parameters for the singular points produces results that satisfy self - similarity well within a flux tube of finite width .    with our method , therefore , we will restrict our solutions to a limited , and conservative , region of parameter space .",
    "the flow in our solutions must remain reasonably non - relativistic in the vtst00 part of the flow ( when gravity is important ) , and we must consider only flux tubes of narrow enough width that field lines satisfy self - similarity to within a specified error in this region with gravity .    fig .",
    "[ energytest ] can be used to see whether the assumptions of the two regimes are not violated for a particular solution .",
    "the kinetic energy ( @xmath61 ) should be negligible near the black hole , while the gravitational potential energy @xmath62 should be significant , satisfying the conditions of the non - relativistic regime and demonstrating the importance of gravity . around the alfvn point",
    "the kinetic energy overtakes , without becoming relativistic .",
    "this is the bridging region where gravity becomes unimportant . only beyond the alfvn point",
    "does the flow become truly relativistic , while gravity becomes negligible , satisfying the conditions of the relativistic regime .    in this work",
    "we have only made a cursory exploration of the full parameter space , and it seems likely that part of that space will allow for solutions with smaller mfp values .",
    "the location of the msp falls within the range of a radiatively - inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) disc model . also , the velocity at the msp , around @xmath63 , is very reasonable .",
    "these features make it plausible that we will be able to match the conditions to an accretion flow as well as to the size of the jet base as indicated by fits to the spectrum @xcite , allowing us to determine the location of the shock region from the conditions at the base of the jet .",
    "it is important to note that since our assumption of non - relativistic flow ( when gravity is important ) eliminates the part of parameter space that produces relativistic flows close to the black hole , we exclude solutions that may relate to physical sources .",
    "future work would include a more general model that allows relativistic flow in the gravitational field .",
    "however , the model in this paper provides a good description of the jet structure near the msp when the flow is non - relativistic .",
    "we should also note that the gravitational field we chose to include here is , at best , a pseudo - newtonian ( or pseudo - schwarzschild ) one .",
    "our solutions , therefore , do not take into account any metric rotation that would occur near a kerr black hole , for example",
    ". however , our method might be able to hint at the presence of a kerr hole , if , for example , after fitting to broad - band data , we find that the footpoint of the field line may be significantly less than the isco of a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath64 ) or that the required magnetisation is significantly greater than would be typical at the isco of a normal keplerian disc .",
    "another issue neglected by our computations ( and , indeed , by all steady state analyses ) is the effect of instabilities on the accelerating jet flow .",
    "we will briefly discuss fluid and mhd instabilities in the weak - field limit and then mhd instabilities in the strong - field limit as well .",
    "figure 2b compares the relative strengths of fluid dynamical forces ( _ i.e. _ , pressure @xmath65 ) with electromagnetic forces ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath66 ) .",
    "we see that the former dominate only below the alfvn point , in the slow magnetosonic region , so it is only there where we expect kelvin - helmholtz ( khi ) or magneto - rotational instabilities ( mri ) possibly to be important .",
    "indeed , the msp itself may lie in the atmosphere of a turbulent accretion disk , giving rise to a somewhat more complex structure in the sub - alfvnic region than that assumed here .",
    "nevertheless , recent two- and three - dimensional simulations of relativistic jets launched from turbulent accretion disks @xcite show that mhd jets similar to those investigated here ( including a well - defined _ classical _ slow point ) do indeed form and are not disrupted by weak - field instabilities near the accretion disk . above this point , like other outflowing magnetospheres ( solar , pulsar , _ etc . _ ) , the dynamical forces in the flow are so dominated by electromagnetic forces ( eventually by many orders of magnitude ) that any weak - field instabilities will be strongly suppressed , or at least unimportant in affecting the kinematics of the accelerating jet .",
    "however , strong - field instabilities ( in particular , the current - driven helical kink [ cdi ] ) need to be looked at more closely .",
    "@xcite , for example , showed that in non - relativistic jet flow rotation velocities well above the alfvn speed can suppress the helical kink , as can a steep external pressure gradient .",
    "they speculated that relativistic flow would further reduce the development of kinks , but a similar detailed relativistic study has not yet been performed .",
    "again , as one of the few relativistic three - dimensional mhd simulations , @xcite can give some insight into the behavior of real mhd jets in the strong - field region . while the accelerating jet appears to be affected somewhat by helical kinking in that study , it does not appear to be disrupted by the cdi .",
    "it remains a viable jet well beyond the classical fast point ( where the rotational speed should be significantly super - alfvnic .",
    "however , no three - dimensional simulation so far has followed the acceleration out to the mfp region , let alone for long model times to achieve a quasi - steady state . and",
    ", detailed numerical parameter studies are even further in the future .",
    "so , the question of whether mhd jet acceleration can be largely stable to strong - field mhd instabilities is still an open question .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to extend the time independent , semi - analytic solutions of pmm10 to solutions that include gravity using a @xmath13-continuous bridging method , connecting two valid regimes with a smooth transition region .",
    "we also extend the mhd wind / jet equation to include a pseudo - newtonian potential for gravity .",
    "for the first time these solutions cross all three singular points and describe a relativistic jet from the vicinity of a central black hole to the point where the flow hits the axis of symmetry .",
    "although these solutions do not satisfy strict self - similarity , the deviations within a flux tube of a certain width can be estimated and controlled , and thus a physically relevant model can be constructed .",
    "we have discovered a solution crossing all three singular points with parameters very close to one from our previous paper .",
    "this new solution shows the relative ease with which solutions can be found and allows for a comparison .",
    "the main differences are the higher distance of the mfp and a significantly higher velocity , both owing to a higher bulk acceleration at the ap .",
    "otherwise the two solutions look very similar , showing that gravity has little influence beyond the region close to the central object . by allowing the creation of an msp",
    ", including gravity enables us to have a reliable description of the flow below the ap .",
    "we have made a cursory examination of parameter space by changing one parameter of a single solution at a time .",
    "this exploration gives a preliminary indication of the extent of the solution space , while at the same time showing the effects it has on the solutions .",
    "in particular we have found that the poloidal spherical angle of the ap has the most significant effect on the height of the mfp . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of the ap to the light cylinder radius has the greatest effect on the height of the msp .",
    "the multi - dimensional solution space is constrained by physical and mathematical conditions . changing only one parameter at a time , when the light cylinder radius approaches the ap , the ap moves outwards ,",
    "the temperature is increased , or the magnetisation decreased , the jets become wider and shorter , with the msp approaching the ap . by increasing the cylindrical radius of the ap , the effects of gravity decrease .",
    "eventually this decrease leads to the regime where an msp can not be created anymore , approaching the situation without gravity .",
    "despite all these constraints , the solution space allows a wide range of parameter values to be chosen , translating into a wide range of properties , like the location of the msp and mfp , the velocity , magnetic energy , density and pressure of the flow .    by matching conditions at the msp to an accretion flow model",
    ", the mathematical parameters considered free in this work will be tied to the conditions at the base of the jet and subsumed into the model , with the wide range of properties in the solution space assuring a good fit .",
    "consequently , the height of the mfp , and the start of the particle acceleration region , will be uniquely determined by the conditions close to the central object , providing a self - consistent connection .",
    "after integration into a model that can determine the spectral emission of a jet solution , we will be able to ascertain the conditions that best describe the overall spectrum of a given black hole system .",
    "in future work we will explore how well this model succeeds in predicting the correct location of the optically thick - to - thin break observed in the broadband spectra of compact jets , hopefully with new insights about the physics of jet launching conditions .",
