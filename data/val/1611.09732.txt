    "piles of granular matter are all around us , from apples in the market stalls to dunes near the beach .",
    "the ubiquity of such aggregates that are typified by sandpiles have raised the interest of scientists for a long time , driven theoretically to understand the shape of such piles ( angle of repose ) and the distribution of normal and shear stresses .",
    "needless to say these issues are also technologically of high interest from the engineering of silos to the wind - induced migration of sand dunes .",
    "indeed , experimental knowledge has accumulated for over a century @xcite . among the many findings relating to the angle of repose and the stability of such piles",
    ", experiments indicated the non - intuitive result that the pressure at the bottom of the pile does not necessarily maximize at the center .",
    "rather , there may appear a dip in the pressure at the center with a ring of maxima ( for piles in 3 dimensions ) some radius away from the center point .",
    "in 2-dimensional piles there may be two maxima in the pressure some distance away from the dip in the center .",
    "the existence of such a dip may depend on material parameters and growth protocols like the piling history@xcite , the shape of the grains @xcite , and as we show below , also on the size of the pile and coefficient of static friction @xmath0 .",
    "computational investigations corroborated these experimental results @xcite .",
    "the explanation of the dip in the pressure is still not fully settled ; in a recent publication @xcite it was even questioned whether classical continuum theories can predict such dips at all . below",
    "we will show that computer assisted continuum theories can indeed result in a dip in the pressure under the apex of the pile .",
    "modern theoretical developments began with edwards and oakeshott s proposition of the concept of arching @xcite .",
    "this concept underlined the relevance of the directional properties of the field of principal axes of the stress tensor .",
    "as pointed out in later contributions @xcite this concept requires an understanding of the spatial solution of the stress tensor , a problem whose mechanics is under - determined .",
    "accordingly , a constitutive relation has to be selected .",
    "since this relation is not dictated by equilibrium mechanics , this selection may be dangerous as it may depend on details of the friction mechanism , the shape of the particles , the protocol of growing the sandpile @xcite etc .",
    "the advent of supercomputers allows us to revisit these interesting issues equipped with a granular model where the effects of friction coefficient , the protocol of growth and the system size can be studied carefully , and where the stress field can be measured accurately . as shown below we find that generically the constitutive relations are hard to guess a - priori , and moreover , they may change with the growth of the pile .",
    "for example we will show that a dip in the pressure at the bottom surface under the apex of the pile may develop with the growth of the pile @xcite .    a major theoretical assumption made in analyzing the equations of static equilibrium",
    "@xcite is the existence of scaling solutions which for a two - dimensional sandpile in @xmath1 coordinates depend only on a scaling variable @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angle of repose .",
    "the coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 are measured from the apex of the pile with @xmath5 in the direction of gravitational force .",
    "the scaling solutions are only tenable when there is no typical length scale in the sandpile other than the system size .",
    "we show below that this assumption is broken for small friction coefficients and for small number of grains .",
    "one of our tasks is to identify the most relevant length - scale and correlate it with the breaking of scaling and its inevitable consequences . more importantly , even when there exist scaling solutions they are not necessarily of the type assumed in the literature as is shown below .",
    "interestingly , often scaling is only weakly broken in the bulk of the pile , but strongly broken at the bottom where interactions with the supporting surface may differ from the bulk interactions .",
    "we will show that the appearance of a pressure dip in the center may very well be related to this strong breaking of scaling .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ model ] we describe our numerical model and the results of numerical simulations including the dependence of the angle of repose on the static friction coefficients and the profiles of pressure and shear stresses everywhere in the pile . in sect .",
    "[ constitutive ] we briefly review the theoretical background available in the literature . in sect  [ theory ] we explain the theoretical modification necessary to get a closer agreement with the simulation results and to provide accurate estimates of the stress and pressure profiles that are of interest . sect .",
    "[ scaling ] examines the observed breakdown in scaling and the necessity for incorporating new length - scales to account for the observed phenomena .",
    "[ summary ] offers a summary , conclusions , and some remarks on the road ahead .",
    "many models of frictional amorphous materials use time dependent dynamics . in our work",
    "we opt to derive a model that can provide complete mechanical equilibration such that at rest the force and the torque on each grain vanishes . to implement an amorphous ( non - crystalline ) two - dimensional sandpile",
    "we construct a model consisting of a 50:50 binary system of disks of two sizes , one with a smaller radius @xmath6 and the other with a larger radius @xmath7 . at every contact between any two disks @xmath8 and @xmath9 we assign a normal and a tangential linear spring aligned in parallel and perpendicularly to the radius vector connecting their center of masses .",
    "the normal and tangential spring constants are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the position of the center of mass of the @xmath8th disk is denoted as @xmath12 while the vector distance  between the center of mass of two particles in contact is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the unit vector in the direction of @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "the force law for the normal spring , @xmath15 , responds to the amount of overlap between particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath16 , as determined by the system configuration .",
    "the tangential spring has an analogous force law , @xmath17 , however the value of @xmath18 is not readily available from the system configuration .",
    "the tangential spring elongation @xmath18 is dependent on the system s history and needs thus to be tracked along the system s path .",
    "consider particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; when this pair of particles is coming into contact the tangential spring is created and by definition is at its rest length , @xmath19 . when grazing , the spring is loaded with respect to the degree of grazing , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes change in angle of the contact point of disc @xmath8 on disc @xmath9 . for computing the degree of relative rotation we consider the radius to be invariant as long as the compression is small .",
    "the expression @xmath22 therefore captures the arc - length and direction along which the point of contact with disc @xmath9 has moved about particle @xmath8 . during the simulation the actual value of @xmath18 is obtained by summing up the incremental values @xmath23 until the coulomb limit is reached . in order to fully define the behavior of particle interaction at the contact it is necessary to differentiate between two types of tangential motions which are _ rolling _ and",
    "_ grazing_. two particles rolling on top of each other do not load the spring , @xmath18 remains unchanged .",
    "both types of interaction are taken into account in the present model . finally , particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 share the same springs and it therefore follows , by newton s third law , that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the frictional slips are dominated by coulomb s law ; the maximal deviation of the tangential spring from its rest length is defined by @xmath26 , where @xmath0 is the friction coefficient . when @xmath27 , then the contact breaks and a slip event occurs , redefining the anchoring point of the tangential spring on both particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 . following experimental evidence @xcite we model the slip event by giving up a fixed portion , chosen below as 20% , of the tangential loading .",
    "in other words , upon reaching the coulomb limit we set @xmath28 ( representing the movement of the tangential spring s anchor on the surface of both particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .    to construct a sandpile",
    "we start with a horizontal  floor \" at @xmath29 along the @xmath4-direction , with one small disk positioned at @xmath30 .",
    "we then add alternating small and large disks always at @xmath30 with some noise @xmath31 chosen with a uniform distribution in the range @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the particle is positioned at a small clearance in its height that guarantees zero overlap with the highest disk in the pile .",
    "after each addition of a disk , we perform conjugate gradient minimization to reach mechanical equilibrium where the forces and torques on each particle sum up to zero .",
    "the interaction of the particles with the floor is at our disposal , and we chose to have the same normal law but with with a higher value of @xmath11 .",
    "there is no reason to assume that the grains interact with the floor as they do among themselves .",
    "most of the simulations described below are done with a value of @xmath11 for the floor interaction that is double the value in the bulk .",
    "we do however test different ratios of the tangential force constants , and see below for details .",
    "finally , the acceleration due to gravity was chosen in the following way : to get a realistic sandpile we should choose the gravitational energy @xmath33 of one particle at height @xmath34 to be of the order of the elastic energy @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the amount of compression . for @xmath37 for the small particle ( and @xmath38 for the large particle ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 we expect @xmath36 not to exceed , say @xmath41 , and thus @xmath42 should be chosen of the order of @xmath43 . with this value of @xmath42 and all the other choices of parameters we get sandpiles that appear physical .",
