    "to account for fat tails , skewness and excessive kurtosis of empirical probability distributions of returns in real financial markets , it has become increasingly popular to model the dynamics of market factors as a lvy process .",
    "lvy models are more realistic than gaussian ones but the latter are much more tractable .",
    "indeed , in the gaussian framework , explicit pricing formulas are known for a wide range of options and other contingent claims both without and with early exercise features , whereas in the lvy models , most of the pricing formulas have been obtained for contingent claims of the european type , with the deterministic life - span .",
    "there are some explicit analytic results for options with early exercise features : see boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2000 , 2001 , 2002a , b ) , mordecki ( 2002 ) and the bibliography therein for pricing of perpetual american options , and boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2002b , c ) for pricing of barrier options and first touch digitals . however , the pricing formulas are complicated and difficult for numerical implementation except for a rather special case of pricing of perpetual american options under exponential jump - diffusions or spectrally one - sided processes .",
    "another obstacle for non - gaussian modelling arises when one considers more general markov processes .",
    "the explicit pricing formulas in affine term structure models and certain lvy - driven ornstein - uhlenbeck models are known in the case of contingent claims with the deterministic life span only  see duffie et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) , chacko and das ( 2002 ) , and barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001b ) , barndorff - nielsen et al ( 2002 ) , respectively ; for non - gaussian variants of the hjm - model , see eberlein and raible ( 1999 ) . in the general case , the dependance on the state variable does not allow one to obtain explicit analytical answers .",
    "the following observation helps to obtain efficient approximate solutions . as barndorff - nielsen and levendorski ( 2001 ) notice ,",
    "typically , a good fit to the data can be achieved with lvy processes whose lvy densities decay as @xmath0 or faster , where @xmath1 ( the steepness parameter of the exponential lvy process ) is large .",
    "they used this property to derive an asymptotic pricing formula for european options under certain class of feller processes .",
    "the same observation was used in boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2002a , b , d ) and kudryavzev and levendorski ( 2002 ) to derive efficient approximate formulas for perpetual american and bermudan options , and first - touch - digitals , respectively .",
    "it was shown in boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2002a , b ) that the simple approximate formula is of the same form as the corresponding formula in a gaussian model even when the underlying lvy process has no gaussian component .",
    "it can be shown that the leading term of the approximate pricing formula in barndorff - nielsen and levendorski ( 2001 ) can also be written as the pricing formula in a gaussian model .",
    "these observations can serve as an analytical explanation of relatively good performance of gaussian models in apparently non - gaussian situations .",
    "thus , as far as pricing formulas are concerned , lvy processes with large steepness parameters behave almost as the brownian motion , and feller processes with large steepness parameters considered in barndorff - nielsen and levendorski ( 2001 ) behave almost as gaussian diffusions .",
    "it seems reasonable to use the nomer _ pseudo - diffusions _ for lvy processes and more general lvy - like feller processes with large steepness parameters .",
    "the modelling with pseudo - diffusions allows one to obtain an efficient approximation to the price ; in some situations , the asymptotic expansion of the price can be obtained , of the form @xmath3 where the leading term , @xmath2 , is the price in the gaussian model with the same instantaneous drift and variance .",
    "the first correction term takes into account the moments of order three as well ( skewness ) , the second correction term accounts for moments of order four , etc .",
    "notice that though the leading term looks as the pricing formula in the gaussian model , the  drift \" and  variance - covariance matrix \" used in the formula for the leading term are not the same as the ones of the gaussian component of the process unless it is purely gaussian .",
    "indeed , a lvy process may have no diffusion component at all .",
    "the aim of the paper is to apply the approximate pricing approach to quadratic term structure models ( qtsm ) when the stochastic factor follows a mean - reverting pseudo - diffusion process of the simplest form ( it is unlikely that in the qtsm model , an explicit pricing formula can be obtained unless the process process is gaussian ) , and derive a pricing formula of the form ( [ asprice ] ) . for the discussion about advantages of the gaussian qtsm model , see ahn et al ( 2002 , 2003 ) and chen and poor ( 2002 ) .",
    "cheng and scaillet ( 2002 ) consider an affine - quadratic model , and allow for jumps but only in the dynamics of affine variables of the model .",
    "notice that the use of jumps in qtsm models adds additional flexibility in joint modelling under the historic and a risk - neutral measures , and one may hope that the performance of qtsm models can be improved by introducing jumps .",
    "another improvement ( and quite sizable one ) is expected in pricing of out - of - the - money options near expiry , where the main contribution to the price comes from the jump part of the process .",
    "near expiry , however , a different approximate formulas are needed , which use more detailed information about the jump part of the processes than the skewness and kurtosis .",
    "these formulas are similar to approximate formulas for out - of - the - money options on stocks developed in levendorski ( 2003 ) , and can be derived by the same reasoning .      in section [ sectlevy ] ,",
    "we list families of exponential lvy processes used in empirical and theoretical studies of financial markets . in section [ sectgen ] , we formulate the pricing problem for an interest rate derivative of the european type , and by using the feynman - kac theorem , reduce the pricing problem to the boundary problem for an integro - differential equation .",
    "we also explain the scheme of the asymptotic pricing . in section [ sectbondg ] ,",
    "we recall the solution of the bond pricing problem in the one - factor gaussian case , and indicate the properties of the solution which are crucial for our asymptotic method . in section [ sectbond1 ] , we demonstrate our method in the simplest case of the one - factor lvy model for the bond price , and present numerical examples . in section [ exten ] , we consider possible specifications of the market price of risk , the generalization for the multi - factor case , derive approximate formulas for interest rate derivatives near expiry , and suggest a procedure of parameter fitting based on the asymptotic expansions . in section [ concl ] , we summarize our results , and compare the lvy qtsm with multi - factor gaussian qtsm . in the appendix , technical results are proven .",
    "as early as in 1963 , mandelbrot suggested to use stable lvy processes .",
    "the modelling with stable lvy processes is not quite realistic since the tails of lvy stable distributions are too fat ( polynomially decaying ) , whereas the tails of distributions of returns observed in real financial markets exhibit exponential decay .",
    "moreover , the second moment of a lvy stable distribution is infinite ( unless it is a gaussian one ) .",
    "this contradicts the observed convergence to the gaussian distribution over a longer time scale , and even worse , the underlying stock itself should have the infinite price under the stable lvy process , which makes the model inconsistent for pricing purposes .",
    "starting with the beginning of the 90th , several families of lvy processes with probability distributions having exponentially decaying tails have been used to describe the behavior of stock prices in real financial markets :    * variance gamma processes ( vgp ) constructed and used by madan and co - authors in a series of papers during 90th ( see madan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the bibliography therein ) ; * hyperbolic processes ( hp ) were constructed and used by eberlein and co - authors ( see eberlein et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , eberlein and prause ( 1999 ) ) ; hyperbolic distributions were constructed by barndorff - nielsen ( 1977 ) ) ; * normal inverse gaussian processes ( nig ) were introduced by barndorff - nielsen ( 1998 ) and used to model german stocks by barndorff - nielsen and jiang ( 1998 ) ; * truncated lvy processes ( tlp ) constructed by koponen ( 1995 ) were used for modeling in real financial markets by bouchaud and potters ( 1997 ) , cont et al ( 1997 ) and matacz ( 2001 ) ; the extended koponen family was constructed in boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2000 ) ( the generalization was needed since probability distribution of koponen s family have tails of the same rate of exponential decay whereas in real financial markets , the left tail is usually much fatter ; in carr et al ( 2002 ) and boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2002a , b ) , the extended koponen family is called cgmy - model and kobol family , respectively ) . *",
    "normal tempered stable lvy processes were constructed in barndorff - nielsen and levendorski ( 2001 ) and barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001a ) ; they contain nig as a subclass .    in boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2000 ) ,",
    "a general class of lvy processes , which contained all the classes listed above modulo certain reservation about vgp was introduced , under the name generalized truncated lvy processes .",
    "later , in barndorff - nielsen and levendorski ( 2001 ) , the name :  regular lvy processes of exponential type \" ( rlpe ) was suggested . for a more detailed exposition ,",
    "see boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2002a , 2002b ) . in order to present examples , recall that a lvy process can be completely specified by its characteristic exponent , @xmath4 , definable from the equality @xmath5=e^{-t\\psi(\\xi)}$ ] .",
    "the characteristic exponent is given by the lvy - khintchine formula @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the variance - covariance matrix of the gaussian component , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the lvy density ( density of jumps ) , which satisfies @xmath10 any _ generating triplet _",
    "@xmath11 with these properties defines a lvy process ( see e.g. sato ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "if @xmath12 , then we have a pure jump process .",
    "wide families of jump - diffusion processes are subclasses of the class of rlpe . in the first example",
    ", we introduce the family which is widely used in affine term structure models ( see duffie et al ( 2000 ) and chacko and das ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "_ example 2.1 .",
    "_ let @xmath13 be a lvy process with the lvy density @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the variance and drift of the gaussian component .",
    "the @xmath20 is analytic in the strip @xmath21 .",

    "since the sum of the characteristic exponents of two rlpe s is the characteristic exponent of an rlpe , the list of model examples can easily be expanded .",
    "for multi - dimensional examples , see boyarchenko and levendorski ( 2002b ) .",
    "examples 2.12.3 are examples of pseudo - diffusions if @xmath31 the model ---------      in the gaussian qtsm , the instantaneous interest rate is represented as a quadratic function of the state variables , and the latter are specified as diffusions .",
    "we assume that under an emm chosen by the market , the sde of the state variables can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an @xmath34-dimensional lvy process , @xmath35 is a continuous vector - function , and @xmath36 is a constant @xmath37 matrix , whose eigenvalues @xmath38 satisfy the condition @xmath39 the interest rate is modelled as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are constant scalar and vector , @xmath43 is the standard inner product in @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a positively definite symmetric matrix .",
    "the last condition ensures that @xmath46 is semi - bounded from below . by choosing @xmath47 and @xmath45 appropriately",
    ", one can ensure any lower bound on @xmath48 .",
    "notice that if one wishes to price a derivative of a stock whose dynamics is characterized by @xmath13 , then one may allow @xmath49 to depend only on some of the factors @xmath50 , say , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ; in this case , in ( [ req ] ) , @xmath53 , and @xmath45 is an @xmath54 matrix .",
    "if @xmath55 has no jump component then the bond pricing problem reduces to a system of ode ( riccati equations ) , which can easily be solved numerically , and in the one - factor case , even analytically .",
    "( in the multi - factor case , a system of riccati equations can be reduced to a linear system ; for the explicit realization in the framework of the gaussian qtsm , see kim ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that a reasonably simple exact solution exists for a general lvy process but we manage to obtain an _",
    "asymptotic solution _",
    "if @xmath13 is a pseudo - diffusion , that is , the lvy density of @xmath55 decays exponentially , and the rate of decay is large . the leading term of the asymptotics is the price in the gaussian model with the same instantaneous moments of order one and two , and the correction terms are polynomials in the factors with coefficients depending on the time to expiry . after the leading term is found , they can be calculated recursively , by using only integration procedures in 1d .",
    "thus , the suggested method is relatively simple ( though in multi - factor models , the number of additional integration procedures may be rather large ; it is important that all the integrations remain one - dimensional , even in a multi - factor model ) . in the one - factor case ,",
    "the first correction term is proportional to skewness , and the second one depends on the skewness and kurtosis ; to be more precise , the first correction is proportional to skewness , and the second one is the sum of two terms , one of which is proportional to the square of the skewness , and the other to the kurtosis . in many cases ,",
    "the contribution of the kurtosis is small relative to the other terms ; if we omit the last term , then the pricing formula becomes a sum of the leading term which looks as the price in the gaussian model , and the correction term , which is a quadratic polynomial w.r.t . to skewness .",
    "similar formula for the forward rate and numerical examples show that the first correction term has a pronounced upward hump , if the skewness is negative ; in the result , the corrected forward rate curve can be hump shaped even when the gaussian forward rate curve is not , and all parameters of the model are time - independent . by changing the parameters , various shapes of the forward rate curve can be obtained .",
    "empirical studies show that both skewness and kurtosis can be fairly large , and hence , the corrections to the gaussian price quite sizable .",
    "consider , for instance , the statistics for the daily change interest rates ( @xmath56 ) from table 1 in das ( 2002 ) .",
    "( the table presents descriptive statistics for the fed funds rate over the period january 1988 to december 1997 , and the unit is 1 percent ) .",
    "mean : @xmath57 ; standard deviation : @xmath58 ; skewness : @xmath59 ; excess kurtosis : @xmath60 .",
    "recall that for probability distribution @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xmath63 and that if @xmath64 is the probability distribution of a lvy process with the characteristic exponent @xmath4 , then @xmath65 @xmath66/{{\\delta t}}=-\\psi^{(4)}(0).\\ ] ] we see that the coefficients in the third and fourth terms in the taylor series for @xmath4 around zero are smaller than the second one but non - negligible whereas in the gaussian case all coefficients starting from the third one are zero .",
    "the skewness and kurtosis of the process under an emm can assume essentially arbitrary values provided they are small w.r.t . variance ; in particular , one should expect that the skewness of the process under emm is negative even when the one under historic measure is positive as in the empirical example above .",
    "this means that even the one - factor approximate non - gaussian model has two free additional parameters ( albeit small ) which can be used to get a better fit to the data than in the gaussian model . in multi - factor models ,",
    "the number of additional free parameters is larger still .",

    "the payoff @xmath71 is measurable ( usually , continuous ) , and it may grow at infinity . in the latter case , additional conditions on @xmath55 may be needed .",
    "for instance , if @xmath71 grows not faster than an exponential : @xmath72 are independent of @xmath73 , then it suffices to assume that there exists @xmath74 such that for all @xmath75 in the ball @xmath76 , and some @xmath77 , @xmath78<\\infty,\\ ] ] which implies that the tails of probability densities of the process @xmath55 decay exponentially : faster than @xmath79 , for any @xmath80 .",

    "numerical examples are produced to show that by changing skewness and kurtosis , various shapes of the forward rate curve can be obtained .",
    "in particular , negative skewness can produce a hump - shaped forward rate curve even when the gaussian curve has no hump : the very non - gaussianity of the process is ( one of ) causes of the hump of the forward rate curve .",
