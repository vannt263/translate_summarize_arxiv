    "the kauffman bracket skein module is an invariant of 3-manifolds which , until recently , was both difficult to compute and topologically mysterious .",
    "the discovery @xcite that a specialization of the module dominates the ring of @xmath1 characters of the fundamental group shed some light on the meaning of the module .",
    "the relationship also provided estimates @xcite @xcite of the module s size and computational tools @xcite .",
    "the central result of this paper sharpens the focus considerably , for we show that the specialization , modulo its nilradical , is exactly the ring of characters .",
    "the construction depends upon a natural correspondence between knots and functions on the set of characters .",
    "given an orientation , a knot corresponds to a conjugacy class in the fundamental group of a 3-manifold @xmath0 .",
    "a formal linear combination of knots is therefore a template upon which one may evaluate characters of @xmath2 represented in @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , one may interpret polynomial functions on the set of characters as linear combinations of links .",
    "these functions form an algebra , of which the the ring of characters is a quotient .",
    "the skein module is also a quotient ( of the linear space of links ) and it , too , has a ring structure .",
    "the correspondence between knots and functions descends to these quotients , where its kernel is exactly the nilpotent elements of the skein module .",
    "the proof proceeds in three stages , the first of which ( section 2 ) recapitulates parts of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we cover the necessary background , including precise definitions of the principal objects of study .",
    "once the vocabulary is in place we define the map , @xmath3 , taking knots to functions on the character set .",
    "the proof that it descends to a surjection on the quotients is quite simple , depending primarily on the following observation : the kauffman bracket skein relation maps to the fundamental @xmath1 trace identity , @xmath4 the characterization of @xmath5 , however , is significantly more involved .",
    "we first study the correspondence for handlebodies and free groups , beginning in section 3 with an investigation of trace identities .",
    "we define a map , @xmath6 , which sends functions on characters into the skein module .",
    "it turns out that @xmath5 contains exactly those trace identities which @xmath6 does not send to zero .",
    "the main result recalls work of procesi @xcite and razmyslov @xcite , who classified a large family of trace identities on arbitrary matrix rings .",
    "we show that these identities , when restricted to @xmath1 , map to zero .",
    "the skein module emerges here as a useful combinatorial tool .",
    "although it is now possible to give purely algebraic proofs of the results in this section , they were all discovered by experimenting with the skein module .",
    "we have retained the geometric arguments for they serve to illustrate the interplay between the two theories and  once the reader has become comfortable with the skein moves  they make for shorter proofs .",
    "section 3 attains sufficient conditions for a trace identity to vanish in the skein module ; section 4 provides the finishing touch .",
    "we rely on a defining set of polynomials for the character set given in @xcite , the central results of which are reiterated in an effort to keep this paper self contained .",
    "most of these polynomials turn out to be specialized procesi identities , while the remaining few succumb to other tools from section 3 .",
    "it follows from a standard result of algebraic geometry that the only trace identities not vanishing in the skein module are nilpotent .",
    "it is then a small step to extend the result to arbitrary compact 3-manifolds .",
    "the author would like to thank professors charles frohman , xaio - song lin , jzef przytycki and bruce westbury for many helpful conversations and suggestions ; adam sikora in particular for his insight into the importance of nilpotents ; and the organizers and participants of the banach center s mini semester on knot theory , where the ideas in this paper first began to coalesce .",
