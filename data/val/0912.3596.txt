    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are short - lived bursts of gamma - ray photons occurring at cosmological distances .",
    "grbs are usually sorted of two classes ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) : short - hard grbs ( @xmath0 ) and long - soft grbs ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the likely progenitors are the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; paczyski 1991 ; narayan et al . 1992 ) and collapsar ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ) , respectively . the popular model of the central engine , namely neutrino dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) , involves a hyperaccreting black hole with mass accretion rates in the range of @xmath2 .",
    "such a model has been widely investigated in the past decade ( see , e.g. , popham et al . 1999 ; narayan et al .",
    "2001 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ; di matteo et al . 2002 ; rosswog et al . 2003 ; kohri et al . 2005 ; lee et al .",
    "2005 ; gu et al .",
    "2006 ; chen & beloborodov 2007 ; liu et al . 2007 ; kawanaka & mineshige 2007 ; janiuk et al . 2007 ; liu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the model can provide a good understanding of both the energetics of grbs and the processes of making the relativistic and baryon - poor fireballs by neutrino annihilation or magnetohydrodynamic processes ( see , e.g. , popham et al . [ 1999 ] and di matteo et al . [ 2002 ] for references ) .    in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , gu & lu ( 2007 ) discussed the potential importance of taking the explicit form of the gravitational potential for calculating slim disk ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) solutions , and pointed out that the hshi form of the potential ( hshi 1977 ) , ( r , z ) ( r,0 ) + _",
    "k^2 z^2  , is valid only for geometrically thin disks with @xmath6 .",
    "thus the well - known relationship @xmath7 constant does not hold for slim disks with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the sound speed , and @xmath10 is the keplerian angular velocity . moreover , with the explicit form of the gravitational potential , liu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that ndafs have both a maximal and a minimal possible mass accretion rate at their each radius , and presented a unified description of all the three known classes of optically thick accretion disks around black holes , namely shakura - sunyaev disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , slim disks , and ndafs .",
    "these works are , however , based on the following simple vertical hydrostatic equilibrium : + = 0  , instead of the general form ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1997 ) : + + v_r + v_z = 0  , where @xmath11 is the mass density , @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 is the cylindrical radial velocity , and @xmath14 is the vertical velocity . since @xmath14 is not negligible for geometrically thick or slim disks , the solutions in gu & lu ( 2007 ) and liu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are still not self - consistent .",
    "recently , gu et al . (",
    "2009 ) revisited the vertical structure in spherical coordinates and showed that advection - dominated accretion disks should be geometrically thick rather than being slim .",
    "however , the detailed radiative cooling was not considered in that work , and therefore no thermal equilibrium solution was established .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the vertical structure of ndafs with detailed neutrino radiation . in section 2 , with the self - similar assumption in the radial direction ,",
    "we numerically solve the differential equations of ndafs in the vertical direction . in section 3 , we present the vertical distribution of physical quantities and show the geometrical thickness and the energy advection of the disk . in section 4 , we estimate the luminosity of neutrino annihilation and discuss some applications to grbs .",
    "conclusions are made in section 5 .",
    "we consider a steady state axisymmetric accretion flow in spherical coordinates ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt the newtonian potential @xmath19 since it is convenient for self - similar assumption , where @xmath20 is the mass of the central black hole .",
    "the basic equations of continuity and momentum are the following ( see , e.g. , xue & wang 2005 ; gu et al .",
    "2009 ) :     ( r^2 v_r ) + ( sin v _ ) = 0 ,  v_r + ( - v _ ) - = - - ,  v_r + ( + v_r ) - = - ,  v_r + + ( v_r + v _ ) = ( r^3 t_r ) , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the three components of the velocity . here ,",
    "we only consider the @xmath24-component of the viscous stress tensor , @xmath25 .",
    "the kinematic coefficient of viscosity takes the form : @xmath26 ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ) , where the sound speed @xmath9 is defined as @xmath27 , the keplerian angular velocity is @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is a constant viscosity parameter .",
    "to avoid directly solve the above partial differential equations , some radial simplification is required since our main interest is the vertical distribution . based on the radial self - similar assumption , begelman & meier ( 1982 ) studied the vertical structure of geometrically thick , optically thick , supercritical accretion disks . under the same self - similar assumption ,",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995 ) investigated the vertical structure of optically thin advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) .",
    "in fact , since the well - known self - similar solutions of adafs ( narayan & yi 1994 ) , such type of solutions has been widely investigated for different classes of accretion , such as slim disks ( wang & zhou 1999 ) , convection - dominated accretion flows ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ) , ndafs ( narayan et al . 2001 ) , and accretion flows with ordered magentic field and outflows ( bu et al .",
    "2009 ) . even though the detailed radiation was considered in some works ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2002",
    "; chen & beloborodov 2007 ) , and therefore the solutions can not be regarded as self - similar solutions , the self - similar assumption was still adopted such that the original differential energy equation can be simplified as an algebraic one .",
    "furthermore , for optically thick flows , ohsuga et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that their simulations are close to the self - similar solutions of the slim disk model ( e.g. , the density profile in their fig .",
    "11 ) . in our opinion ,",
    "the radial simplification is necessary for the study of vertical structure and it is a good choice to take the well - known self - similar assumption .",
    "similar to narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , we adopt the following radial self - similar assumption :  ( r , ) r^-3/2 ,  c_s ( r , ) , v_r ( r , ) , v_(r , ) r^-1/2 ,  v_(r , ) = 0 . with the above assumption , equations ( 5 - 7 )",
    "can be simplified as follows :  ^2 + ^2 + v_^2 - r^2 _",
    "k^2 = 0 ,   = v_^2 ,  v_r = - . integrating equation ( 4 ) over angle",
    "we obtain the mass accretion rate ,   = -4 r^2 _ _",
    "0^ v_r d , where @xmath30 is the polar angle of the surface .",
    "the equation of state is  p = p_gas + p_rad + p_e + p _ , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the gas pressure from nucleons , the radiation pressure of photons , the degeneracy pressure of electrons , and the radiation pressure of neutrinos , respectively .",
    "detailed expressions of the pressure components were given in liu et al .",
    "we assume a polytropic relation in the vertical direction , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "the energy equation is written as  q_vis = q_adv + q _ , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the viscous heating rate per unit area , the advective cooling rate per unit area , and the cooling rate per unit area due to the neutrino radiation , respectively . here",
    "we ignore the cooling of photodisintegration of @xmath29-particles and other heavier nuclei .",
    "the viscous heating rate per unit volume @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] and the advective cooling rate per unit volume @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the internal energy per unit volume ) are expressed in the self - similar formalism as q_vis = ,  q_adv = - . where the entropy of degenerate particles is negligible .",
    "thus the vertical integration of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the following :  q_vis = 2 _ _",
    "0^ q_vis r d  ,  q_adv = 2 _ _ 0^ q_adv r d. the cooling due to the neutrino radiation @xmath39 can be written as  q_= 2 _ _ 0^ q_r d  , where @xmath43 is the sum of urca processes , electron - positron pair annihilation , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , and plasmon decay ( see , e.g. , liu et al .",
    "we therefore can obtain the luminosity of neutrino radiation @xmath44 by integrating @xmath39 .    in our system",
    ", we have six physical quantities varying with @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath23 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the six equations for solving these quantities are equations ( 11 - 13 ) , ( 15 ) , the polytropic relation , and the definition of @xmath9 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "three boundary conditions are required to solve the system since there is one differential equation , and the boundary @xmath30 and the constant parameter @xmath36 in the polytropic relation are unknown .",
    "now we have already two boundary conditions , i.e. , equations ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) , thus one more boundary condition is required for solving the system , which is set to be @xmath47 ( accordingly @xmath48 and @xmath49 , e.g. , kato et al .",
    "2008 , p.  244",
    ") at the surface of the disk , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the numerical method is as follows . for given @xmath29 , @xmath20 , @xmath51 , @xmath15 , and a test @xmath30 , from the above six equations and two boundary conditions ( except the energy equation , eq .",
    "[ 16 ] ) , we can numerically obtain the vertical distribution of the above six quantities . with equations ( 19 - 21 )",
    ", we then check whether equation ( 16 ) is satisfied for the test @xmath30 . by varying @xmath30",
    "we can find the exact value of @xmath30 for which equation ( 16 ) is matched , and therefore we obtain the exact vertical distribution of all the variables . in our calculations",
    "we take @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "figure 1 shows the variations of the density @xmath11 , temperature @xmath45 , electron fraction @xmath54 , and radial velocity @xmath21 with the polar angle @xmath16 for @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath54 is defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the total number density of protons and of neutrons , respectively ( e.g. , beloborodov 2003 ; liu et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted lines represent the solutions at @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the profiles of @xmath11 and @xmath21 are similar to that of the optically thin advection - dominated accretion flows ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath21 ( the absolute value ) decrease from the equatorial plane to the surface . on the contrary ,",
    "electron fraction @xmath54 increases from the equatorial plane to the surface and approaches @xmath61 near the surface , which means that the matter is non - degenerate .",
    "the vertical distribution of @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "1(@xmath62 ) , indicates a multilayer flow with the matter close to the equatorial plane being accreted much faster than that near the surface .",
    "figure @xmath63 shows the variation of the half - opening angle of the disk @xmath64 with radius @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted lines represent the solutions with @xmath67 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that , in the inner region of the disk , the half - opening angle increases as increasing accretion rates . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the inner disk is extremely thick with the half - opening angle is @xmath69 radian , which implies that there exists a narrow empty funnel @xmath70 along the rotation axis .",
    "figure @xmath71 shows the variation of the energy advection factor @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) with @xmath65 .",
    "it is seen that advection becomes important in the inner disk for @xmath74 . comparing figs . @xmath63 and @xmath71",
    ", we find that the curves of the half - opening angle and the advection factor are similar , which indicates that the geometrical thickness is relevant to the advection .",
    "for @xmath75 , it is seen from fig .  2 that the half - opening angle is around @xmath76 radian .",
    "we therefore stress that ndafs should be significantly thick when advection becomes dominant , which is in agreement with narayan & yi ( 1995 ) since their solutions imply that the flows are extremely thick with the half - opening angle approaching @xmath77 .",
    "in our calculations , the inner disk will be quite thick for large mass accretion rates , @xmath74 . thus the volume above the disk shrinks and the radiated neutrino density increases .",
    "accordingly , the neutrino annihilation efficiency also increases . we have obtained the neutrino luminosity @xmath44 ( before annihilation ) , thus the luminosity of neutrino annihilation @xmath78 can be roughly evaluated by the assumption : @xmath79 ( see , e.g. , mochkovitch et al 1993 ) , where @xmath80 is the annihilation efficiency , and @xmath81 is the volume above the disk . for a given outer boundary @xmath82",
    ", we calculate @xmath83 by integrating the region of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the variations @xmath86 and @xmath78 with @xmath51 are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the present solutions whereas the dashed lines correspond to those in liu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . as shown in fig .  3 , for the same @xmath51 , @xmath86 is comparable , whereas @xmath78 in the present results is significantly larger than that in liu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , we find that for @xmath87 , @xmath78 is very close to @xmath86 , which means that the density of radiated neutrino is so large that the annihilation efficiency is close to 1 .",
    "thus we can expect that @xmath78 is roughly equal to @xmath86 for @xmath88 .",
    "many previous works have calculated the annihilation luminosity and claimed that the ndaf mode can provide enough energy for grbs .",
    "however , grbs are generally believed to be a jet with a small opening angle @xmath89 .",
    "the problem is that , the annihilation could not be limited into such a small angle even though the region well above the inner disk have larger luminosity than other place .",
    "we argue that our model is preferably to explain the ejection - like radiation , because the disk is adequately thick and there exists a narrow empty funnel along the rotation axis , which can naturally explain the neutrino annihilable ejection .",
    "in this paper we revisit the vertical structure of ndafs in spherical coordinates .",
    "the major points we wish to stress are as follows :    1 .   we show the vertical structure of ndafs and stress that the flow should be significantly thick when advection becomes dominant .",
    "the luminosity of neutrino annihilation is enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "the narrow empty funnel ( @xmath90 ) along the rotation axis can naturally explain the neutrino annihilable ejection .",
