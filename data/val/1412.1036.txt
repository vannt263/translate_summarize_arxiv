    "understanding the distinct roles of noise and determinism is important for all experimental chaotic systems .",
    "we examine a scale - dependent lyapunov exponent ( sdle ) of a boolean chaotic system that iterates the dynamics a one - dimensional ( 1d ) map .",
    "a sdle was studied previously as a way to distinguish the entropy of microscopic noise from the entropy of macroscopic chaos @xcite .",
    "this distinction and the transition from a microscale entropy to a macroscale entropy is of increasing importance as physical random number generators that use chaotic systems as entropy sources continue to be developed @xcite .",
    "our experiment iterates a macroscopic tent map with microscopic noise and an intermediate scaling caused by mesoscopic discontinuities in the map . here",
    ", we demonstrate experimentally that the scaling of these discontinuities manifests as a structured scale - dependence in the lyapunov exponent of our boolean chaotic system .",
    "boolean chaos is a term used to describe the phenomenon of deterministic dynamics in unclocked boolean networks with an exponential divergence of neighboring trajectories .",
    "originally , theories of continuous , ideal boolean networks predicted non - repeating switching in certain networks , but without chaos @xcite .",
    "contrary to this prediction , recent experiments showed that physical logic gates can introduce non - ideal effects that give rise to such chaos @xcite .",
    "boolean chaos has been reported in both autonomous and driven networks @xcite , both of which yield complex , multi - dimensional dynamics .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) boolean chaotic maps were theorized for specific non - ideal effects @xcite .",
    "here , we examine the first experimental 1d boolean chaotic map and report its unique , multi - scaled features .",
    "our experimental setup is influenced by recent studies of non - chaotic autonomous boolean systems .",
    "in particular , asynchronous networks of logic gates were studied as excitable systems with synchronization patterns @xcite and phase oscillators with chimera states @xcite .",
    "one appealing feature of these boolean systems is that they can be implemented entirely on a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) , a common component in modern electronics .",
    "this platform allows for large dynamical networks of asynchronous logic gates to easily be built @xcite .",
    "the implementation of our experiment is also facilitated by an fpga , where we note that our system is not a simulation on a finite - state - machine ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; it is an unclocked system with non - zero entropy and a potential continuum of dynamical states that are subject to analog effects and experimental noise .",
    "our experimental system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]a , which is initialized by an input voltage pulse of initial pulse - width @xmath0 .",
    "this pulse drives a map operator @xmath1 which consists of two separate functions : a pulse - width folding - function @xmath2 and a pulse - width gain - function @xmath3 that approximately doubles a pulse s width ( details provided later ) , where this combination of folding and stretching are sufficient conditions to see chaos @xcite .",
    "the output voltage of @xmath1 is labeled as @xmath4 , and a delay line routes @xmath4 back to the input of @xmath1 , where the delay is long enough to ensure only one pulse is in this feedback loop at a time .",
    "we note that this is a time - delay system with an infinite dimensional phase space , but neighboring pulses do not interact , allowing for 1d dynamics .",
    "this system remains in a stable steady state @xmath5 v until we inject a pulse , and thus @xmath0 serves as its initial condition .    after an initial pulse",
    "is injected , the system produces a self - sustaining pulse - train . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]b - c , we plot the temporal evolution of @xmath4 , which contains pulses that occur with non - repeating pulse - widths @xmath6 and non - repeating spacings @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the transition times in @xmath4 are the state variables of the chaos .",
    "this is different from analog chaotic circuits that iterate 1d maps in discrete or continuous time and use voltage or current as the state variables @xcite .",
    "the power spectral density of @xmath4 ( not shown ) is broadband with prominent frequency components at integer multiples of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ns is the average pulse - repetition period and can be adjusted with the feedback delay .    to analyze the dynamics , we study @xmath10 , which is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : dynamics]d ; as we will show later , @xmath11 is a function of @xmath10 and contains no new information about the dynamics .",
    "we construct the return map using @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]e , which shows a 1d structure similar to a tent map @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dynamics]e also shows that the density of the return map is non - uniform , which differs from an ideal tent map .",
    "we fit fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]e using a piecewise - linear function @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average slope and @xmath15 is the folding point .",
    "the fit yields @xmath16 and @xmath17 ns , which shows that the map is not a tent - map of full height .",
    "we note that a tent map of full height in the experimental boolean implementation can only show transient chaos before collapsing to the steady state @xmath5 v due to short - pulses rejection ( spr ) by the physical logic gates @xcite . the slope @xmath18 limits the grammar of the map and prevents pulse widths @xmath19 ns , allowing for non - transient chaos .",
    "interestingly , we might approximate the lyapunov exponent @xmath20 using @xmath21 such that @xmath22 @xcite",
    ". however , using this fit of the return map to estimate @xmath20 assumes a continuous map . as we will discuss later",
    ", the discrete logic gates in the system s design create discontinuities in the output of the operator @xmath1 .",
    "to avoid assumptions about the experimental system , we instead compute a sdle from @xmath10 .",
    "we define a sdle @xmath23 as the divergence of neighboring trajectories along the return map , where neighbors @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 where @xmath27 determines the scale of @xmath23 and @xmath28 is a fixed width that determines the window size to search for neighboring points . for a given @xmath27",
    ", we find all @xmath24 and @xmath25 that satisfy eq . [ [ eq : epsil ] ] and define the initial trajectory separation as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the index of @xmath31 total neighboring pairs .",
    "next , we follow the trajectories of each neighboring pair @xmath32 and calculate their normalized divergences @xmath33 for @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "an example of two neighboring trajectories @xmath36 and @xmath37 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapunov]a .",
    "we then average @xmath38 over all @xmath30 .",
    "an example of @xmath39 for a given @xmath27 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapunov]b on a log scale .",
    "lastly , we use a linear fit of @xmath39 ( up to @xmath40 ) , where the slope of the linear fit gives the initial exponential separation of the neighboring trajectories for a given @xmath27 .",
    "we define this initial exponential separation as @xmath41 .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapunov]b yields @xmath42 , where we divide by @xmath43 to provide a unitless quantity . following this procedure , we calculate @xmath41 for a scan of @xmath27 in 10 ps steps and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapunov]c . in the figure ,",
    "we use a scaling reference of @xmath44 , which is the approximate delay time through a single logic element .",
    "we note that @xmath45 is an indicator of trajectory separation at an exponential rate .",
    "figure [ fig : lyapunov]c demonstrates that the experimental system exhibits exponential separation from both noise and chaos .",
    "neighboring points on the return map with @xmath46 have an initial separation that is dominated by microscopic noise , while for @xmath47 the sdle shows oscillations in the divergence rate at frequency @xmath48 near @xmath49 ( the value of the lyapunov exponent for a continuous tent - map of the full height ) .",
    "thus , the rate of divergence shows a structured scale - dependence about a global rate that is described by the macroscopic features of the return map . studying this phenomenon is important for understanding the transition from microscopic noise to macroscopic chaos . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we briefly outline the design of fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]a and examine the map operator s functions to motivate a simple model that exhibits a similarly structured sdle .",
    "our experimental system exploits the propagation delays of pulses as they transmit through logic gates . in the simplest example , the feedback loop @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]a acts as a continuous delay line that routes pulses from the output of the map operator back to its input .",
    "this delay line is constructed using cascaded not gates @xcite , where even numbers of not gates are used to reduce asymmetries between rise and fall times of pulse edges that propagate @xcite and preserve pulse widths .",
    "the number of not gates @xmath51 sets the propagation delay @xmath52 .    in the map operator ,",
    "a folding function @xmath2 is implemented with the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : tentmapfolding]a . in the figure ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are signals for input pulses of width @xmath55 and output pulses of width @xmath56 , respectively , such that @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 . to illustrate this circuit s folding , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tentmapfolding]b we plot experimental examples of @xmath61 of the folding circuit , and in fig .",

    ". we model @xmath62 from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : tentfold ] ] with @xmath63 , and we note @xmath64 does not address @xmath11 , but based on the folding circuit s operation , we derive @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .    the pulse - width gain function @xmath3 of the map operator is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching]a . in the figure ,",
    "an input pulse @xmath54 is launched into a delay line of not gates , where and gates compare the outputs of gates @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the index number of @xmath70 total not gates such that @xmath71 .",
    "the and - gate outputs drive a multi - input or - gate , which outputs a pulse @xmath4 of width @xmath72 for @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the delay through @xmath70 gates . to illustrate the pulse - width gain from this circuit , we plot examples of @xmath75 and a scan of @xmath76 in figs .",
    "[ fig : stretching]b - c , respectively .",
    "the resulting waveforms show approximate pulse - width doubling and the characterization of @xmath76 has average slope @xmath77 .",
    "however , the discrete nature of the and - gate comparisons of the delay line in fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching]a creates regularly - spaced discontinuities that are not resolved in fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching]c . based on these discrete comparisons ,",
    "we model the discontinuous pulse - width gain as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a measure of @xmath56 in single gate - delays , and @xmath80 is a function that describes the width of an output pulse for a single gate . as @xmath55 increases in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : discont ] ] , @xmath3 is discontinuous and increases by steps of @xmath44 .",
    "we define @xmath81 such that , when @xmath55 is an integer multiple of @xmath44 ( @xmath82 , the pulse - width gain is exactly 2 .",
    "when @xmath56 is not an integer multiple of @xmath44 , @xmath80 provides a corrective term that describes the continuous growth of pulse widths , where the input to @xmath80 resets at each multiple of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath3 is has an average slope @xmath83 with discontinuities spaced regularly by @xmath44 and local slope(s ) @xmath84 in between each discontinuity .    for simplicity",
    ", we let @xmath85 such that the map @xmath86 is an example of a piecewise - linear system that exhibits noise - induced chaos .",
    "noise - induced chaos occurs in chaotic systems that only show periodic or steady state dynamics without the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "similar models with discontinuities have been previously studied with the use of a sdle , where with enough noise , these simulated chaotic maps exhibit characteristics of their macroscopic map structures @xcite .",
    "a different choice for @xmath80 , such as a nonlinear function , can yield chaos without noise , but we choose the simplest chaotic model with mesoscopic discontinuities and microscopic noise .",
    "noise in the fpga causes jitter in @xmath10 , where we measure the jitter to be approximately gaussian with standard deviation ( std ) @xmath87 ps .",
    "we simulate the map @xmath88 using eqs . [",
    "[ eq : tentfold]-[eq : discont ] ] with @xmath89 , @xmath90 ns , @xmath91 ns , and additive - white - gaussian - noise at every iteration ( std @xmath92 ) .",
    "the simulated return map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations]a with a 1d structure similar to a tent map with slopes @xmath93 .",
    "the probability density of the map is also non - uniform , where clustering occurs at evenly - spaced intervals .",
    "this differs from the experimental density because , in the model , we can guarantee that @xmath94 , for integer @xmath95 . even though there are an integer number of logic gates in the experimental @xmath15 , heterogeneities in gate delays due to physical effects and fpga routing cause @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a cumulative timing difference .",
    "we implement a timing difference in the model ( not shown ) and note that clustering in the return map changes with @xmath97 .",
    "next , we calculate the simulated sdle @xmath98 for the return map in fig . [",
    "fig : simulations]a .",
    "we acknowledge that there are different methods for the treatment of noise when computing lyapunov exponents in simulated chaotic systems with noise @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", we compute iterations of the model with additive noise at each iteration and search for neighboring points .",
    "this method is equivalent to specifying nearby initial conditions and using different realizations of noise along each trajectory .",
    "furthermore , this method allows us to emulate the process of collecting experimental data and use the same algorithm for finding the sdle that is applied in the experiment .",
    "the resulting simulated sdle is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations]b . in the figure ,",
    "the sdle increases rapidly as @xmath27 goes to zero , which is similar to the observed experimental sdle . for @xmath99 , the divergence of neighboring points",
    "is dominated by a stochastic , uncorrelated process provided by the additive gaussian noise .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : simulations]b demonstrates that @xmath98 contains mesoscopic features @xmath100 ) that oscillate about the average divergence rate of the macroscopic chaos .",
    "similar to the experiment , the oscillatory structure in the simulated sdle has a frequency of @xmath101 and not @xmath102 .",
    "based on the model s construction , we attribute the @xmath103 frequency to grammar restrictions in the dynamics that are caused by symmetric gaps on either side of the map @xmath1 due to the discontinuities in @xmath3 . though the symmetry of these gaps is not visible in the experimental map , it is inherent in its design and we hypothesize that , on average , similar grammar restrictions occur in the experimental dynamics .",
    "thus , the results from the simple model are quantitatively similar to those from the experimental boolean system , where more agreement can likely be achieved by introducing individual gate - delay heterogeneities , using a macroscopic slope @xmath104 , and exploring nonlinear functions for @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , we note that the structures in the simulated slde become more ( less ) pronounced for lower ( higher ) levels of noise , and for sufficiently high noise levels , the structures are no longer detectable . as examples , in figs . [ fig : simulations]c - d , we include the results from simulations of the model with noise levels @xmath105 ps and @xmath106 ps . for @xmath105 ps , the amplitude of the oscillatory structure grows while its frequency remains fixed . for @xmath106",
    "ps , the noise is on a comparable scaling to the mesoscopic @xmath44 , which removes the structure in the sdle .",
    "this suggests that some physical chaotic systems may have underlying fine - scaled features that do not play a role in the divergence of trajectories because they are on the same scale or smaller than the microscopic noise levels .",
    "in addition , as shown in figs . [",
    "fig : simulations]b - d , the amplitude of the noise influences the size of the microscopic region in the sdle ; larger noise amplitudes extend the microscopic region to larger epsilon @xcite .",
    "lastly , introducing irregularly - spaced discontinuities in the model ( not just at @xmath44 but at @xmath44 , @xmath107 , etc . ) also blurs these structures ( not shown ) and suggests that heterogeneities may be a mechanism that removes structures in the sdle . in our experiment ,",
    "the mesoscopic spacings between discontinuities can be tuned by moving the and - gate inputs in fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching]a , and thus our 1d boolean chaotic system is a good candidate to begin exploring these concepts .    in summary , we present an experimental chaotic system with a macroscopic 1d return map , microscopic noise , and mesoscopic discontinuities that are regularly spaced .",
    "we demonstrate these three scalings in a sdle and observe that the mesoscopic features create an oscillatory structure in the sdle . using a physically - motivated , simple model",
