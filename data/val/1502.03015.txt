    "the blazar is the class of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which has the most number of extragalactic source in the very - high - energy gamma - ray regime ( @xmath4 gev)@xcite .",
    "they are characterized by double - peaked nonthermal emission with spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in radio to gamma - ray regime .",
    "blazars include bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "in addition bl lacs include high - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , intermediate - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( ibls ) and low - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) . in the leptonic model ,",
    "the low and high bump of sed is explained by the synchrotron and the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) and/or external compton ( ec ) radiations .",
    "the estimation of ec in the second hump is a matter of great importance in estimating external photons .",
    "one of the characteristic of the blazar spectra is blazar sequence . in 1998 , fossati et al . combined three complete blazar samples@xcite ; the 2 jy samples of fsrqs@xcite , the radio selected 1 jy samples of bl lacs@xcite and the x - ray selected sample(einstein slew survey ) of bl lacs @xcite .",
    "the thirty - third sources of selected sample were detected in high - energy gamma - ray regime ( @xmath4 mev ) by the egret instrument on - board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "these sources were devided 5 bins based on the 5 ghz radio luminosity and averaged the sed of the each type of the blazars .",
    "the made sed suggested some relationship ; first , the synchrotron peak frequency and the bolometric luminosity have the anti - correlation .",
    "second , the synchrotron peak frequency and the compton peak frequency have the positive - correlation . finally , the compton dominance ( the ratio of the inverse compton to synchrotron luminosity ) and the bolometric luminosity have positive - correlation .",
    "these correlations are known as `` the blazar sequence '' in considering the blazar physics .",
    "we aim to reveal the relation between the evolution process of agns and the blazar sequence based on the systematical study for many blazars .    in this study , we calculated @xmath5 agns ( blazars ) to find the difference of the variability amplitude in blazar types and evolution of the variability amplitude ( activity ) .",
