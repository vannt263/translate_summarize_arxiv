    "recently , a great interest has been devoted to consensus problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and the literature cited within ) .",
    "consensus refers to a scenario where a number of agents with interdependent dynamics converge to a common value .",
    "when this happens we say that the agents reach an agreement or _",
    "consensus_. if state @xmath0 is the resource owned by agent @xmath1 , consensus means that strong agents , those with large resources , transfer part of these resources to weak agents .",
    "interdependency has a `` local '' flavor , in the sense that each agent can exchange resources only with a subset ( say it _ neighborhood _ ) of adjacent agents . in its simplest form",
    "the consensus problem can be modeled as an autonomous cooperative linear system with a laplacian dynamic matrix .    in this work ,",
    "we study a discrete event system ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) that behaves in a complementary manner with respect to the above system .",
    "we model a competitive scenario where strong agents , gain more and more resources at the expenses of weak ones .",
    "this unstable dynamics can be captured by assuming that between two consecutive events , the system evolves as a discrete time autonomous linear system as before , but now the dynamic matrix is the opposite of a time dependent laplacian matrix .",
    "deviation between neighbors states / resources increases and for this reason the system is named _ competitive _ system .    with this premise , it makes sense to assume that when an agent looses all its resources , its state goes to zero , then it `` dies '' .",
    "the dead agent is then removed from the system together with all its connections .",
    "_ death _ introduces a discrete event into the system dynamics .    on the contrary ,",
    "when an agent gains a critical amount of resources , then it _",
    "duplicates_. the agent , say it _ parent _ , divides in two new agents , say it _ childrens_. both the childrens initial states and neighborhoods are functions of the parent state and neighborhood respectively .",
    "_ duplication _ introduces furtherly a second discrete event into the system dynamics .",
    "such a modeling framework which we formalize in this paper for the first time , goes under the name of _ dissensus_. the law ruling the discrete time evolution will be called _",
    "dissensus protocol_.    dissensus is motivated by applications where multiple agents compete for scarce resources . in marketing , as an example , agents represent firms or companies and resources are market shares or number of customers .",
    "competition often results in firms with a large customer base attracting more and more customers at the expenses of the smaller firms  @xcite .",
    "death describes a firm abandoning the market for lack of customers .",
    "duplication captures the situation where a firm expands and then divides into smaller firms .",
    "duplication may be forced by different causes .",
    "for example , the intervention of an anti - trust authority ; the presence of physical constraints in large infrastructures such as airports ; the departure of apprentices / young partners from the mother firm to open a new one , in case of service businesses or handicraft industry .",
    "other applications are in biological networks , e.g. , adjacent cells compete for nutrients @xcite .",
    "the state of an agent describes its size , that in turn is ( approximately ) proportional to the amount of nutrients the cell subtracts to its adjacent cells .",
    "finally , as a theoretical example , let us introduce what we call the _ dynamic pie diagram_. in a dynamic pie diagram , the amplitude of each slice evolves over time .",
    "the larger slices become ampler and ampler at the expenses of their adjacent slices .",
    "whenever the amplitude of a slice becomes zero , the slice disappears ( dies ) . on the other hand , whenever the amplitude of a slice reaches a given angle the slice is partitioned ( duplicates ) .",
    "resources flows are quantized and involve at each time a single pair of agents selected according to a gossip rule .",
    "dissensus in continuous time and continuous / unquantized flows have been introduced by the same author in  @xcite .",
    "quantization in consensus problems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "gossip algorithms in consensus problems have been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : cp ] , we present the dissensus protocol . in section  [ sec : basicproperties ] , we discuss invariancy of the states and network connectivity . in section  [ sec : division ] , we comment invariancy of topologies under specific death and duplication rules .",
    "some final comments are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the system evolves according to a quantized discrete time dynamics interrupted at _ critical times _ by some discrete events which we will call _ critical events_. between each two consecutive critical times  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , with  @xmath4 , the system is made of a set of agents @xmath5 whose cardinality  @xmath6 is a function of the time instants  @xmath2 .",
    "the agents  @xmath7 are characterized by states  @xmath0 that assume only discrete values in  @xmath8 .",
    "the same agents are organized in a single component _ connection network _",

    "in addition , for the easy of notation , we omit the dependence on  @xmath2 when there is no risk of ambiguity . then , e.g. , we write  @xmath14 instead of  @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of each agent state depends on local information meaning that it depends only on the state of the agent neighbors .",

    "the authors computational experiments show that , for a generic systems with @xmath163 not complete , the density of the connection network usually increases until @xmath168 becomes a complete network if the rule  ( [ eq : likefather ] ) is applied and the agents do not reach consensus , see @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have introduced systems of competitive agents exchanging quantized flows according to a dissensus protocol .",
    "we have discussed some invariancy properties of the systems and observed that the number of agents is bounded from below and above over time . as a future direction of research we are oriented toward the definition of more general rules for the inheritance of the connections .",
    "indeed , the main limit of the current version of the dissensus protocol seems the fact that the inheritance rule of the connections applies only when an agent dies . in many real competitive systems the larger agents may acquire the connections of the smaller agents when the latter ones are still alive .",
    "consider the following two examples .",
    "the number of the cells adjacent to ( that is , in the neighborhood of ) a cell  @xmath1 of a tissue is a function of the size of the cell  @xmath1 and not only of the possible occurrence of a death of an adjacent cell .",
    "similarly , the rules used for the dynamic pie diagram in fig .  [ fig : piediagram ] can not trivially be extended to a general dynamic tessellation .",

    "<S> _ dissensus _ is a modeling framework for networks of dynamic agents in competition for scarce resources . originally inspired by biological cells behaviors , it fits also marketing , finance and many other application areas . </S>",
    "<S> competition is often unstable in the sense that strong agents , those having access to large resources , gain more and more resources at the expense of weak agents . </S>",
    "<S> thus , strong agents duplicate when reaching a critical amount of resources , whereas weak agents die when loosing all their resources . to capture all these phenomena we introduce systems with a discrete time gossip and unstable state dynamics interrupted by discrete events affecting the network topology . </S>",
    "<S> invariancy of states and topologies and network connectivity are explored .    * keywords * : consensus protocols , quantized control , dynamic programming , network based marketing , dynamic pie diagram . </S>"
