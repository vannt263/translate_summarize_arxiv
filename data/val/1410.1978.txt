    "long - range pseudo - rapidity separation ( @xmath0 ) correlations at small azimuthal difference ( @xmath1 ) , called the ridge , have been observed in high - multiplicity p+p and p+pb collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a subtraction of the dihadron correlation in low - multiplicity p+pb collisions from high - multiplicity ones reveals a back - to - back double - ridge structure ( at @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "a similar double - ridge is also observed by phenix in d+au collisions using the same subtraction method @xcite .",
    "differences between multiplicity - selected d+au collisions ( and p+p collisions ) have been observed before by star @xcite .",
    "recent alice results show a mass ordering of the proton and pion elliptic anisotropy parameters , @xmath4 , characterizing the double - ridge correlations in p+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "a similar mass ordering is observed by phenix in d+au collisions @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic models , where collective flow develops in p / d+a collisions @xcite , and the color glass condensate model , where two - gluon production is enhanced , provide two possible explanations to the ridge in small systems @xcite .",
    "measurements from the large acceptance star detector should shed light on the long - range correlation in d+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the data used in this analysis are composed of 4 million d+au events at nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy of @xmath5 gev , collected by the star detector in 2003 .",
    "three main detectors used in this analysis are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the forward time projection chamber ( ftpc ) , and the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) .",
    "the minimum bias events were triggered by the zdc in the au beam direction ( zdc - au ) .",
    "the events are required to have the reconstructed primary vertex within 50 @xmath6 of the tpc center along the beam direction .",
    "the charged tracks reconstructed in the tpc and ftpc are required to satisfy the following conditions : the distance of the closest approach to the primary vertex less than 3 @xmath6 to remove secondary tracks from particle decays ; the number of fit points greater than 25 ( 5 ) in the tpc ( ftpc ) for good track reconstruction , and larger than 0.51 times the maximum number of possible fit points to avoid split tracks .",
    "the track pseudo - rapidity cuts are @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in the tpc ( ftpc ) @xcite .",
    "two sets of dihadron correlations are analyzed in this study : tpc - tpc correlations with both the trigger and associated particles from the tpc ( @xmath9 ) , and tpc - ftpc correlations with the trigger particle from the tpc and the associated particle from the ftpc ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "both trigger and associated particles have transverse momentum @xmath11 gev/@xmath12 . the @xmath0-@xmath1 dihadron correlation ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 )",
    "is given by @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the raw dihadron correlation for pairs in the same event ; and @xmath17 is for trigger and associated particles from different ( mixed ) events .",
    "the mixed event background serves as the correction for the detector two - particle acceptance ; @xmath18 is the average @xmath19 at fixed @xmath20 , where the two - particle acceptance is 100% ; @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) for tpc - tpc ( tpc - ftpc ) correlations .",
    "the mixed events are required to have primary vertices within 1 @xmath6 of each other in the beam direction to resemble similar acceptance , and have similar event characteristics .",
    "the yields are corrected for the associated particle tracking efficiencies , @xmath23 85% for tpc tracks and",
    "70% for ftpc tracks .",
    "the underlying event background is further subtracted by @xmath0-dependent zero - yield - at - minimum ( zyam ) method @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying the width of the zyam normalization @xmath0 range from 0.4 to 0.2 and 0.6 radian .",
    "an additional 5% tracking systematic uncertainty is applied .",
    "high multiplicity is required for event selection in order to observed the ridge . in this analysis",
    ", we use the raw charged particle multiplicity in @xmath24 measured by the au direction ftpc ( ftpc - au ) for event selection , similar to the @xmath25 range used by phenix .",
    "we also use the neutral particle energy deposited in zdc - au .",
    "the correlation between the ftpc - au multiplicity and the zdc - au neutral energy is positive but broad , thus these two measurements select significantly different event samples . in this contribution , the ftpc multiplicity selection is used for the tpc - tpc correlations , while zdc energy selection for the tpc - ftpc correlations .",
