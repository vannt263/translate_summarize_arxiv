    "the anderson  holstein model is widely used to describe electronic transport through individual molecules contacted between two leads : the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is described as a single , spin - degenerate ( in the absence of a magnetic field ) level of a quantum dot with a coulomb repulsion between electrons of opposite spin .",
