    "many clusters of galaxies exhibit a sharp profile around the x - ray emission peak at the center , and their intracluster medium ( icm ) becomes cooler toward their center .",
    "this is apparently consistent with the idea of a cooling flow model ( review ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , other observational phenomena have also been found and can not agree with the simple cooling flow picture ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to obtain more information about the physical condition of the icm in the central part of clusters , spatially resolved measurements of the temperature , absorption column density , and metal abundance",
    "are needed .",
    "the spatial resolution and effective area of previous x - ray satellites did not allow us to resolve the innermost cluster regions in detail .",
    "recent observations with chandra and xmm - newton revealed complex physical properties of the icm in the central region of the perseus cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , hydra - a cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a 1795 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a 1835 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and a 496 ( @xcite ) clusters , which are typical cooling flow clusters .",
    "one of the important results is that the icm temperature at the central region is not as low as @xmath11 kev , which is expected from the simple cooling flow model .",
    "x - ray emission of the perseus and hydra - a clusters shows holes with x - ray bright rims , which are caused by an icm displacement by the radio jet .",
    "these results indicate that the radio jet is violently interacting with the icm , and is thus a possible candidate of heating sources which would reduce the cooling flow .",
    "however , the icm temperature of bright rims surrounding the radio jet in the perseus cluster is @xmath1 2.7 kev , which is cooler than the ambient icm . in the case of the hydra - a cluster",
    ", there is no correlation between the radio jets and spectral hardening due to shock of radio jet . on the other hand , evidence of jet heating",
    "is reported for mkw3s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the region of depression in the x - ray surface brightness , which lies south of the x - ray peak , exhibits a higher temperature than the surrounding one , indicating energy injection from the central radio galaxy .    in this way",
    ", two contrasting results coexist concerning whether the heating mechanism associated with radio jets exists or not .",
    "therefore , it is important to obtain much more information on the x - ray properties in the central cluster region .",
    "2a 0335 + 096 ( @xmath2 ) and a 2199 ( @xmath3 ) are nearby x - ray bright cooling flow clusters of galaxies .",
    "the cooling flow rates are relatively large , 181 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ( @xcite ) and 90 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ( @xcite ) , for 2a 0335 + 096 and a 2199 , respectively .",
    "they are accompanied by radio jets at their center , especially for a 2199 , whose radio jets from the cd galaxy ngc 6166 seem to interact with the icm ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus possible that heating or cooling by the radio jets takes place in the central region of both clusters .",
    "according to these properties , they are good targets to approach the problems on the cooling flow , in terms of the temperature structure and excess absorption .",
    "they are bright enough to be resolved finely by the chandra observatory with good photon statistics .",
    "the spectral coverage provided by chandra allows an accurate estimate of their icm temperature , which is expected to be around 4 kev .",
    "significant excess absorption was reported for 2a 0335 + 096 by @xcite based on the einstein sss observation ; they claimed that it is attributed to cooling flow .",
    "the low galactic absorption toward a 2199 is also advantageous to constrain excess absorption .",
    "the high spatial resolution provided by chandra allows us to spatially resolve the x - ray emission of these clusters on the arcseconds scale .",
    "we report in this paper on spatial and spectral analyses of 2a 0335 + 096 and a 2199 , both observed with acis - s on board chandra .",
    "the results of an analysis of the chandra observation of a 2199 was presented by @xcite , who derived several x - ray properties of the central cooling region .",
    "since these two clusters are a good pair for a comparison to understand the central cooling region of clusters of galaxies , as described above , we also reanalyzed the chandra data on a 2199 in the same way as for 2a 0335 + 096 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath6 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ; @xmath7 kpc for 2a 0335 + 096 and @xmath8 kpc for a 2199 , respectively .",
    "we observed 2a 0335 + 096 on 2000 september 16 , with a back - illuminated ccd chip , acis - s3 , loaded onto chandra .",
    "the total exposure time was 20 ks ( obsid 919 ) .",
    "a 2199 was also observed with the chandra acis - s3 on 1999 december 11 . for a 2199 , we used archival data ( obsid 498 ) , and the total exposure time was 19 ks .",
    "when we started the analysis , no blank sky data were available , and thus we employed data of the galaxy ngc 3184 as background , since it was observed in the same acis set up as both clusters , and does not contain any bright x - ray sources .",
    "we confirmed that the background level of the ngc 3184 data is consistent with that of on - source data .",
    "the background was estimated in the same detector region as on - source data by using the software @xmath9 which is provided by maxim markevitch . ]",
    "all of the data retrieved from the chandra data center were at level 12 .",
    "we used the ciao 2.0 software package provided by cxc for the data analysis , and all spectra were corrected with the calibration product caldb 2.9 .",
    "the x - ray image of 2a 0335 + 096 in the 0.49.0 kev band is shown in figure 1a .",
    "the x - ray emission of 2a 0335 + 096 does not seem to be circularly symmetric ; the south region of the center is brighter and the ne region is relatively fainter .",
    "a hole is seen in the direction of nw at @xmath10 of the cluster center .",
    "this hole is not associated with any radio sources , and is thus thought to be the same feature as ` ghost ' cavities reported for the perseus cluster and abell 2597 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are considered to be fossils of radio - bright cavities after electron cooling .",
    "the vla radio observation of 2a 0335 + 096 , performed in 1987 and 1992 , revealed that it has twin jets which emanate from the cd galaxy , and are extended up to @xmath11 toward the ne and sw ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio image in the central region of 2a 0335 + 096 is shown in figure 1b .",
    "a spatial resolution of 16@xmath12 did not allow us to resolve finer structures comparable to the ones observed in chandra .",
    "for the first time , however , we noticed a weak correlation between the x - ray emission and the radio jet in the direction of ne from the center , thanks to the high spatial resolution of chandra . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that the x - ray emission of a 2199 is displaced by the radio jet at the center more clearly than 2a 0335 + 096 .",
    "a short radio jet extending up to @xmath13 kpc is visible on the e and w sides of the cd galaxy .    in order to derive physical quantities of the icm , such as the gas density",
    ", the x - ray surface brightness profile was fitted by the canonical @xmath14-model ( @xcite ) , and is shown in figure 2 . here",
    ", the cluster center was determined to be the position of the cd galaxy , which almost coincides with the root of radio jets .",
    "the best - fit parameters and reduced chi - square are listed in table 1 .",
    "the profile is rather well - fitted by a single @xmath14 model ; there is no excess in the x - ray surface brightness at the center .",
    "the @xmath14 and core radius , @xmath15 , are consistent with @xmath16 of the rosat hri observation ( @xcite ) and @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the asca gis ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the x - ray surface brightness of 2a 0335 + 096 can be quite well represented by a single @xmath14-model from the most inner to outer region .",
    "although the icm distribution of 2a 0335 + 096 is not circularly symmetric , as described in subsection 3.1 , we first investigated the spectral variation toward the radial direction in order to understand the overall features of the icm . to obtain radial profiles of the temperature ,",
    "column density and metal abundance , spectral fittings were performed for several annuli centered on cd galaxies in the 0.5@xmath1910 kev region .",
    "the background spectra and response matrices were extracted from the corresponding region .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are shown in figure 3a . here",
    ", we pick up four characteristic spectra at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 annuli .",
    "fe - l lines become stronger and shift to the lower energy side as the radius becomes small , indicating that the temperature decreases toward the cluster center .",
    "we also show the spectra of a 2199 for comparison in figure 3b .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the absorption in the lower energy band is quite different between two clusters .",
    "this is mainly due to a large difference in the galactic column density : 1.7@xmath24 @xmath25 and 8.7@xmath26 @xmath25 for 2a 0335 + 096 and a 2199 , respectively .",
    "this well demonstrates that the acis - s spectrum is very sensitive to the photoelectric absorption .",
    "these spectra of 2a 0335 + 096 were fitted with a one - temperature mekal thermal - plasma model ( @xcite ) with photoelectric absorption .",
    "the free parameters are the temperature ( @xmath27 ) , column density ( @xmath28 ) , metal abundance ( @xmath29 ) and normalization . as a result , the reduced chi - squares , @xmath30/dof , are 1.11.6 for radii beyond 40@xmath12 , and 1.62.7 within 40@xmath12 .",
    "we then tried to fit the spectra with the two - temperature mekal model .",
    "the abundance is tied to be the same among two components , and the temperature of the hot component is fixed at 3.3 kev , which is that of the outermost region .",
    "the fittings were improved for spectra within 40@xmath12 from the center , and the reduced chi - squares @xmath30/dof became smaller by 0.30.5 .",
    "the @xmath30/dof of one and two - temperature fittings in the center of 2a 0335 + 096 are shown in table 2 .",
    "the temperature of the cool component was 1.31.6 kev , somewhat lower by 0.20.3 kev than that in the fitting with the single - temperature model .",
    "since the core radius of the x - ray surface brightness is about 35@xmath12 , the spectra within 40@xmath12 are thought to be affected by a projection effect .",
    "however , the purpose of our work is to search for evidences of jet heating from relative temperature variations .",
    "the projection effect on the best - fit temperature is at most 0.20.3 kev , which is not very significant for our purpose .",
    "therefore , here after , we discuss our results on the single - temperature model fitting .",
    "figure 4 shows radial profiles of @xmath27 and @xmath28 obtained from spectral fittings with the single - temperature mekal model .",
    "we first refer to the temperature profile ( figure 4a ) . at 150@xmath12 from the cluster center , the temperature reaches @xmath31 kev , which is somewhat higher than the outer - region temperature obtained with asca : 3.0@xmath32 kev at @xmath33 radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "this might be an indication of a radial temperature decrease toward the outer region , as claimed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the temperature declines toward the cluster center , as reported based on a rosat analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "our chandra results present finer and clearer profiles . in the simple cooling flow model ,",
    "the temperature is predicted to decline steeply down to @xmath34 1 kev at the center .",
    "however , the actual temperature profile does not indicate such a steep decline ; the gas temperature within @xmath35 is almost constant at @xmath11.5 kev .",
    "the temperature of the cool component in the two - temperature model is also higher than 1 kev . in the case of a 2199",
    ", the temperature at the center is reported to be @xmath12.0 kev , which is fairly high for the simple cooling flow picture .",
    "interestingly , both clusters exhibit apparent differences of the temperature profiles .",
    "the low - temperature region in 2a 0335 + 096 is extended up to @xmath36 kpc ( @xmath37 ) , while that of a 2199 is up to only @xmath38 kpc .",
    "the temperature profile in the very central region within @xmath35 is flatter for 2a 0335 + 096 than for a 2199 .",
    "secondly , regarding the absorption profiles ( figure 4b ) , in the central region , the absorption is @xmath39 @xmath40 , which is consistent with the previous results of einstein sss ( @xcite ) , rosat pspc ( @xcite ) , and asca ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , problems concerning the response matrix of acis - s in the lower energy band ( @xcite ) are not significant for our results . on the other hand ,",
    "our results show that the absorption is almost constant up to 3@xmath41 ( @xmath42 kpc ) .",
    "this indicates that there is no central excess absorption , and therefore no evidence of a large amount of cool gas predicted from the cooling flow picture . from a 21 cm line observation ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the hydrogen column density is estimated to be @xmath43 @xmath40 , which is half of the value compared with that inferred from the x - ray absorption .",
    "this discrepancy implies the possible existence of galactic interstellar gas with high metallicity toward the direction of 2a 0335 + 096 .    finally",
    ", we refer to the metal abundance .",
    "the metal abundance is almost constant around 0.3 solar with a small variation of @xmath10.1 solar over the acis - s field of view .",
    "this trend is consistent with the asca results of 0.34@xmath440.04 solar and 0.30@xmath440.03 solar ( @xcite ) , which were derived from spectral fittings for the inner 2@xmath41 and outer @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "a more detailed investigation on the metal abundance is beyond the scope of this paper . in summary , we have obtained results on the spectral properties of 2a 0335 + 096 that are consistent with the previous ones in the outskirts of the cluster , and definitely more accurate than previously published in the central regions , where we have spatially resolved the temperature and absorption distribution .      in subsection 3.2",
    ", we mentioned that the central temperature is higher than that predicted from the cooling flow picture .",
    "this temperature profile can be explained if there is a certain heating mechanism against cooling , for example , radio jets or merging .",
    "here , we consider any evidence of jet heating . to examine the relation between the azimuthal temperature variation and radio jets , we obtained temperature maps with @xmath45 square grids in a @xmath46 region around the cluster center .",
    "the background spectra and responses were prepared as described in the previous section .",
    "the single - temperature mekal plasma model was used again , and could fit the spectra well .",
    "we also performed this analysis on a 2199 , since the square region of the temperature map obtained by @xcite is somewhat large for the scale of radio jets , and we would like to compare the maps with the same and finer grid scales .    figure 5 shows two - dimensional temperature maps .",
    "the typical error of the temperature in each grid are 10% and 15% for 2a 0335 + 096 and a 2199 , respectively .",
    "both clusters exhibit an asymmetric temperature structure . in 2a 0335 + 096 , although the radial temperature profile exhibits a gradual decrease toward the cluster center , as shown in figure 4a , the temperature structure around the central @xmath46 region is fairly complex ; there is no clear trend of circular symmetry .",
    "there are two hot regions of @xmath47 size along the jet direction ( ne and sw ) , located at @xmath48 from the center , where the temperature is somewhat higher by 0.30.5 kev than that in the surrounding region . a significant cool region",
    "is largely extended toward the se region , and another local cool region exists at the nw direction . both cool regions are located perpendicular to the jets , and their temperature is @xmath49 kev , lower than the central temperature of @xmath50 kev .",
    "we have found no evidence of a spectral hard component from jets or agn .",
    "for a 2199 , the overall temperature structure is consistent with that of @xcite , and the circular symmetry is relatively better than that of 2a 0335 + 096 .",
    "the most noticeable cool region exists at the southern region of the center , and there is a weak hint of a higher temperature along the e and w jet directions .",
    "in order to visualize the temperature variation more clearly and show the significance with error bars , we obtained the azimuthal temperature profiles with an azimuthal angle interval of 22@xmath51.5 .",
    "the azimuthal temperature profiles were investigated on four concentric circles . at each azimuthal angle , the spectrum was integrated within a circle whose radius was chosen to be 5@xmath12 , 5@xmath12 , 10@xmath12 , or 15@xmath12 on each concentric circle of 10@xmath12 , 20@xmath12 , 40@xmath12 or 70@xmath12 from the cluster center , respectively .",
    "the obtained azimuthal temperature profiles are shown in figure 6 . here , the azimuthal angle is defined as 0@xmath51 for the northern direction from the cluster center , and increases clockwise . in 2a 0335 + 096",
    ", the central radio jets lie at 135@xmath51 ( ne : northeast ) and 315@xmath51 ( sw : southwest ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the azimuthal temperature profile exhibits a large variation , which has been already noted by figure 5a .",
    "the high - temperature region is seen at 320@xmath51 for the inner region , which is almost the same direction as the sw jet . on the other hand ,",
    "temperature depression exists around @xmath52 at the outer region , which is perpendicular to jets . in a 2199 ,",
    "the radio jets lie at 90@xmath51 ( e : east ) and 270@xmath51 ( w : west ) .",
    "a faint temperature depression is scarcely seen in the outer region around the e and w jets , as hinted in figure 5b .    as a result",
    ", some correlations between the temperature variation and radio jets are detected for both clusters , and 2a0335 + 096 exhibits a larger amplitude of the temperature variation .",
    "therefore , we compared the radial temperature distributions between the jet direction and its perpendicular one , so that we can trace the region size of the temperature disturbance .",
    "the resulting temperature distributions are shown in figure 7 .",
    "it can be seen that the profile is asymmetric .",
    "the ne jet ( open circles in the left region of figure 7 ) shows a remarkably higher temperature at @xmath53 from the center than the opposite ( sw ) , consistent with figure 6a .",
    "the se temperature - depression region in figure 6a ( around @xmath54 ) is also clearly noticed at @xmath55 from the center in the left region of figure 7 ( filled squares ) .    in summary ,",
    "regions of both high and low temperature are found at @xmath56 from the center along the ne jet and the se region for 2a 0335 + 096 , while a 2199 exhibits an asymmetric temperature distribution in the direction perpendicular to the jets within 30@xmath12 of the center , and has a low - temperature region at the end of the e and w jet .",
    "we analyzed chandra data for 2a 0335 + 096 and a 2199 to obtain the spatially resolved central properties of the icm .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is not circularly symmetric at the center of both clusters . in 2a 0335 + 096",
    ", the se part is brighter and a radio - quiet x - ray hole exists at the nw part , although we find no significant disturbance by radio jets . on the other hand , a clear correlation with the east  west radio jets",
    "is seen in a 2199 ; an x - ray emitting hot plasma is displaced by jets .",
    "the temperatures of both clusters gradually decrease toward the center .",
    "however , the central temperatures of both clusters are not as low as @xmath57 kev ; 1.6 kev and 2.0 kev for 2a 0335 + 096 and a 2199 , respectively .",
    "an asymmetric temperature distribution is found around the radio jets and the central @xmath58 kpc region perpendicular to the jets .",
    "it is interesting that the temperature variation is milder for a 2199 , which exhibits a clearer disturbance of the icm density by jets .",
    "the radial profile of the absorption column density is fairly uniform , except for the central region within 50 kpc where some increases of @xmath59 @xmath40 are barely seen .",
    "the cooling time at the radius where temperature starts to drop is 2@xmath60 yr at 160@xmath12 ( 163 kpc ) for 2a 0335 + 096 and @xmath61 yr at 100@xmath12 ( 89 kpc ) for a 2199 , based on our chandra results and @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be said that the low - temperature region exists within the cooling radius , which is defined as the radius where the cooling time is comparable to the age of the cluster ( @xmath110@xmath62 yr ) .",
    "this result seems to be consistent with the cooling flow picture .",
    "however , in this scenario , the action of radiative cooling leaves the central icm to temperatures below 1 kev , values that we did not observe in the clusters under examination .",
    "in particular , a high temperature of @xmath12 kev at the center of a 2199 is not easy to explain .",
    "therefore , the chandra results for both clusters are not consistent with the simple cooling flow picture .",
    "our results indicate that although radiative cooling may occur , some heating mechanisms would prevent the icm from cooling down to @xmath63 kev .",
    "an excess of the absorption column density toward the center of cooling - flow clusters is expected if a large amount of gas cools down and deposits at the cluster center . in the past",
    ", observations with the einstein sss reported the existence of absorbing cold matter ( @xcite ) , whose column density is ( 510)@xmath64 @xmath40 ; also , rosat observations sometimes claimed an increase in the absorption column density toward the cluster center ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "einstein sss observations reported that 2a 0335 + 096 exhibits a significant excess of the absorption column density : @xmath65 @xmath40 against the galactic value of @xmath66 @xmath40 .",
    "rosat pspc observations also confirmed this value at the center of 2a 0335 + 096 , and gave a hint of a gradual decrease of the absorption toward the outer region ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the narrower energy band and poorer energy resolution of einstein and rosat compared with the chandra observatory did not allow us to constrain the absorption column density accurately , because of the complex spectral properties at the cluster center .",
    "chandra acis - s , for the first time , determined the absorption column density accurately , as well as the radial distribution of the absorption , thanks to its energy resolution , wide energy band down to 0.3 kev , and superior angular resolution . as a result",
    ", there is no sign of significant excess in absorption for both clusters .",
    "a little evidence of excess absorption of @xmath67 @xmath40 within 50 kpc of the center in both clusters can be explained by the cold interstellar medium of mass @xmath68 in the central galaxy . for 2a 0335 + 096",
    ", the absorption value , itself , at the cluster center is consistent with the previously observed results , and the radial decrease that was previously suggested was not observed by acis - s within @xmath42 kpc of the center . even if the distribution of cold material extends over @xmath42 kpc , the absorption must be the largest toward the cluster center .",
    "therefore , our results rule out the existence of a large amount of cold material .",
    "it can be said that the rosat pspc results are consistent with no absorption gradient , considering their large errors ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a significant discrepancy remains that the obtained absorption is larger than the galactic value determined from radio observations .",
    "we suggest that unidentified molecular clouds in our galaxy exist toward the direction of 2a 0335 + 096 .",
    "we obtained a fine temperature map around the cluster center , and found that the temperature varies locally and mildly .",
    "both hot and cool regions are found along the radio jets , indicating that radio jets can certainly heat up the icm locally and at the same time compress it to be adiabatically cooled .",
    "considering these results , it is suggested that radio jets recently ejected from cd galaxies were not powerful enough to give a large amount of shock - heated energy to the ambient icm .",
    "the temperature varies by about 1 kev on a scale of few tens of kpc at most with a gas density of @xmath69 @xmath70 , corresponding to work of @xmath71 erg . the cooling loss by radiation is estimated to be @xmath72 erg s@xmath5 at the center of both clusters .",
    "we consider the effect of heat conduction , combined with the sound speed in the plasma , which reduces the temperature and density variation in the icm .",
    "the heat conduction flux was calculated to be @xmath73 erg s@xmath5 for an @xmath74 kev gradient in @xmath110 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "this heat flux shows that the typical heated - up regions found in both clusters vanish within @xmath75 yr .",
    "the crossing time scale of the sound velocity is also of the same order .",
    "hence , the icm disturbance caused by jets can survive for as long as @xmath75 yr . the cumulative heating energy to reduce the radiative cooling over the past @xmath76 yr should have been @xmath77 erg , which is about 100-times larger than that inferred from the present icm disturbance ; in other words , the relatively mild variation of the icm temperature and the density in both clusters implies that jet heating in both clusters is not effective enough to restrain the cooling flow , at least during the last @xmath78 years .",
    "therefore , cd galaxies should have ejected relativistic plasma and produced jets that are more powerful than that actually observed @xmath79 years ago by an order of magnitude , if radio jets are attributed to a reduction of the radiative cooling , setting aside other heating processes , such as merging .",
    "a few nearby clusters have such a powerful radio jet at a redshift of @xmath80 , like , e.g. , the cygnus - a cluster .",
    "this implies that most cd galaxies might have ejected quite a powerful radio jet in the past , and such an active phase might have ended @xmath81 years ago .",
    "the authors thank an anonymous referee for a careful reading of the text and many helpful comments .",
    "the authors are also grateful to the chandra team for their help in the spacecraft operation , calibration , and data analysis ."
