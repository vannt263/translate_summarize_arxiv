    "during the last decade , graphene has attracted enormous attention , and has provided a new paradigm for studying pseudo - relativistic fermions in condensed - matter systems [ ] .",
    "the peculiar dirac - type structure of its low - energy quasiparticles arises due to the lattice geometry and time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the honeycomb lattice , which consists of two equivalent interpenetrating triangular lattices , gives rise to the touching of the valence and conduction bands at two inequivalent @xmath3 and @xmath4 points at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone ( bz ) , which are related by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "although the first proposal for a time - reversal topological insulator invoked graphene [ ] , its experimental realization has been hampered by the weak spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in this material .",
    "on the other hand , this created a lot of activity towards the tailoring of artificial structures exhibiting dirac cones and strong soc .",
    "some of the so far proposed systems include self - assembled honeycomb arrays of cdse and pbse semiconducting nanocrystals [ ] , patterned quantum dots [ ] , and molecular graphene [ ] .",
    "yet another interesting class of dirac materials in this respect consists of graphynes .",
    "graphynes are two - dimensional carbon allotropes that differ from graphene by the presence of triple bonds ( @xmath5c @xmath6 c@xmath5 ) into their lattice structure [ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : lattices ] displays the lattice structure of @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-graphyne .",
    "they have not been experimentally realized yet , as opposed to graphdiyne [ ] , which features _ pairs _ of acetylene bonds in its crystal lattice . since their proposal in 1987 [ ] ,",
    "they have attracted considerable interest , especially because of their band structure , which exhibits dirac - like properties [ ] . in particular ,",
    "it has been shown by using _",
    "ab initio _ and tight - binding ( tb ) methods [ ] that @xmath0-graphyne features dirac cones at the high - symmetry @xmath3 and @xmath4 points of the bz , whereas in @xmath1-graphyne they occur along the high - symmetry @xmath7 line . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2-graphyne is gapped .",
    "a criterion for the existence of the dirac cones has been provided within simple tb models [ ] .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of manipulation of the dirac cones by chemical reactions has been discussed [ ] .",
    "the control of the electronic properties with adatoms has been considered in refs .",
    "[ ] , which is particularly important in light of inducing topological properties in graphyne - based materials .",
    "topologically nontrivial properties of the electronic band structure of a material , from a practical perspective , critically depend on the strength of the spin - orbit interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "graphynes are based on carbon and , as such , are expected to feature a weak soc , as it is the case in graphene , for instance .",
    "the effect of intrinsic soc in these systems has been recently investigated using _ ab initio _ methods [ ] .",
    "furthermore , the above - mentioned possibility of controlling the electronic properties of graphynes with adatoms puts forward a way of manipulating soc in these systems by using adatoms of heavy elements , such as bi and sn , for instance . before doing so",
    ", however , a general framework for addressing soc in graphynes has to be developed .",
    "this is precisely the aim of the present paper .",
    "the effect of soc in @xmath1-graphyne has been previously investigated by the same authors [ ] . here , we derive a general tb theory of the spin - orbit interactions in graphynes , apply it to @xmath0- and @xmath2-graphynes , as well as provide a comparison of the effects of the soc in the three compounds . for completeness",
    "we also repeat some of our results on @xmath8graphyne previously reported in ref .",
    "we concentrate on the effect of both rashba soc , which can be induced by an external electric field , as well as on the intrinsic soc .",
    "we find that the spin - orbit interactions produce different effects for @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-graphyne . in @xmath0- and @xmath1-graphyne [ ] , the intrinsic soc opens up a non - trivial band gap .",
    "the rashba soc affects @xmath0-graphyne in exactly the same way as it does for graphene : it lifts the spin degeneracy and splits each dirac cone into four distinct dirac cones . in @xmath1-graphyne",
    "the rashba soc splits each dirac cone into two , instead of four .",
    "as the coupling is increased , this pair of cones eventually merges with another pair on the line connecting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "when the coupling is further increased , a new pair of dirac cones emerges at the line connecting the @xmath9 and @xmath10 points .",
    "finally , in @xmath2-graphyne the effect is the opposite as compared to @xmath1-graphyne , since now one begins with a gapped system , and if the rashba soc parameter exceeds a certain value , the dirac cones emerge along the line connecting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points .    in the following , we first introduce in sec .",

    "iii and introduce an effective model in sec .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "v , and the details of the calculations are presented in appendices .",
    "the three types of graphyne can all be described in terms of a tb model that takes into account only the @xmath11 orbitals .",

    ", we need to reconsider the derivation presented in sec .",
    "the models we considered therein only describe the band - structure due to the @xmath11 orbitals , but the bonds in graphyne are formed by the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 orbitals , called @xmath75 orbitals due to their symmetry . when soc is not involved , the @xmath76 and @xmath11 orbitals decouple since the former are even and the latter are odd with respect to mirror reflection through the @xmath77 plane .",
    "the inclusion of spin changes this picture drastically .",

    "this microscopic hamiltonian @xmath91 couples now the @xmath72 orbitals to the @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "this occurs as a consequence of the broken mirror symmetry .",
    "it turns out that the combination of the terms @xmath92 and @xmath91 leads to the rashba soc , while @xmath92 alone leads to the intrinsic soc . hence , to describe soc in graphyne it is necessary to include both the @xmath11- and the @xmath75-orbitals . on top of the soc generated by the @xmath75-orbitals",
    ", we also need to consider the effect of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 orbitals , as it has been shown before for graphene [ ] . however , the nature of this effect is entirely different in graphynes , because even without considering spin , the @xmath11 orbitals already couple to the @xmath93 and @xmath94 orbitals .",

    "we discuss separately the soc generated by the @xmath75-orbitals and by the @xmath95-orbitals .      since we have to include the @xmath75-orbitals and spin , the number of orbitals in the tb models increases by a factor of 8 ( 2 for spin , 4 for orbitals ) .",

    "we write each matrix as the sum of a spin - independent part , denoted by a tilde , and a part describing the soc , denoted by the subscript soc .",
    "because the soc parameters are very small compared to the other hopping energies , we may expand eq .",
    "( [ effsoc ] ) up to first order in them .",
    "one then readily obtains @xmath133 where @xmath134 however , if we simply set @xmath135 we do not miss any gap openings or shifts in the positions of the dirac cones .",
