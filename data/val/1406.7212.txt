    "since the 1960s there have been substantial efforts , both experimental and theoretical , to unravel the quark structure of hadrons .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of the various hadrons have played a crucial role in this process , as they reflect their internal quark ( and gluon ) structure  @xcite .",
    "the form factors of the pion and the kaon are of particular interest , because these mesons are associated with the goldstone modes of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite and play important roles in the description of the nuclear force  @xcite . the pion form factor has been measured in the region of low to medium momentum transfer  @xcite and future measures at higher momentum are planned  @xcite . the kaon form factor , on the other hand , is poorly known experimentally , except in the region of very low momentum transfer  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "qcd based studies of the pion and kaon form factors have been carried out , e.g. , in the framework of perturbative qcd  @xcite , the dyson - schwinger equations @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the dressed ( or equivalently constituent ) quark mass dependence of the pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors , including effects from the virtual pion cloud around the dressed quarks and from vector mesons , using the three - flavor njl model with four - fermion interactions .",
    "the njl model is a powerful chiral effective quark theory of qcd  @xcite , with numerous successes in the study of meson  @xcite and baryon  @xcite structure .",
    "in several recent studies  @xcite it has been demonstrated that one important aspect of quark confinement , namely , the absence of thresholds for the decay of hadrons into free quarks , can be implemented via a judicious choice for the regularization prescription . following these lines",
    ", we will use the proper - time scheme  @xcite in this study . in our calculations",
    "there is only one free parameter , which we take as the dressed light quark ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) mass @xmath3 . for the dressed @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark masses , and @xmath4 for the associated current quark masses . ]",
    "the constituent quark model suggests dressed quark masses in the range @xmath5@xmath6gev , and it is often fixed at @xmath7gev in njl model calculations of form factors  @xcite and structure functions  @xcite .",
    "however , an important goal of our present study is to show that results for the current quarks masses , quark condensates , the kaon leptonic decay constant , as well as the pion and kaon charge radii and form factors , can be improved by using a smaller dressed light quark mass of @xmath8gev .",
    "the dressed quark mass dependence of these observables is therefore investigated .",

    "concerning quark condensates , a recent lattice qcd analysis @xcite found @xmath13 for the ratio of strange to light ( @xmath14 ) nonperturbative ( physical ) quark condensates .",
    "as we shall see , our results for those three ratios @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , together with the pion charge radius , are in excellent agreement with the empirical and qcd based results if the mass of the dressed light quark is approximately @xmath8gev .",
    "we emphasize that , because our model is free of unphysical decay thresholds , there are no problems in obtaining hadron masses which are greater than the sum of their dressed quark masses , which is important for the extension of these studies to , e.g. , the @xmath18 meson and the nucleon .",
    "the main point which we wish to make in this paper is to show that the results for the pion and kaon form factors , as well as the other physical quantities mentioned above , can be much improved by using a rather small value of the dressed light quark mass .",
    "corrections from the pion cloud and vector mesons to the quark - photon vertex are important to attain this good overall picture . in order to keep the simplicity of the njl model description , however",
    ", we do not intend to present a full study of meson loops in this work .",
    "we will explicitly consider the meson loop corrections only for those processes which involve an external virtual photon probe , that is , the pion cloud corrections ( see fig .  [ pc - figure ] ) and the corrections from @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons ( see fig .",
    "[ vmd ] ) to the quark - photon vertex . for the other processes , like those shown in figs .",
