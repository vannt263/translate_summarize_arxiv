    "a growing amount of experimental data has now confirmed that neutrinos possess mass and mix among themselves  @xcite .",
    "the masslessness of the neutrinos in the minimal standard model ( sm ) implies that extra ingredients beyond them are necessary to account for this observation . despite the accumulating knowledge of neutrino properties ,",
    "the nature of the mechanism responsible for generating neutrino masses and mixing is still a mystery  @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected , however , that the underlying new physics would also modify the structure of the electroweak neutral and charged currents in the sm .",
    "such modifications in the neutrino sector give rise to the so - called nonstandard interactions ( nsi ) of the neutrinos  @xcite . in most studies on such nsi ,",
    "they arise from the exchange of new particles that are usually assumed to be heavier than the electroweak scale and , thus , lead to effective four - fermion interactions for low - energy phenomenology . nevertheless , it is also feasible that the exchanged new particle is not heavy , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the gev or sub - gev regime .",
    "one of the simplest possibilities along this line is that the new particle is a spin-1 boson .",
    "scenarios beyond the sm involving new spin-1 particles with relatively low masses have been considered to some extent in various contexts in the literature . generally speaking ,",
    "their existence is not just still compatible with current data , but also highly desirable , as they may offer explanations for some of the recent experimental anomalies and unexpected observations .",
    "for instance , a  spin-1 boson having a mass of a few gev and interactions with both quarks and leptons has been proposed to explain the measured value of the muon @xmath1@xmath22 and the nutev anomaly simultaneously  @xcite , although the latter may now be explicable by taking into account the appropriate nuclear effects  @xcite . as another example",
    ", an @xmath3(mev ) spin-1 boson which couples to dark matter as well as leptons may be the cause of the observed 511-kev emission from the bulge of our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "if its mass is at the gev level , such a particle may be associated with the unexpected excess of positrons seen in cosmic rays , potentially attributable to dark - matter annihilation  @xcite . in the context of hyperon",
    "decays , a  spin-1 boson with mass around @xmath4gev , flavor - changing couplings to quarks , and a primary decay channel into @xmath5 can account for the three anomalous events of @xmath6 detected in the hypercp experiment several years ago  @xcite .",
    "lastly , a  spin-1 particle lighter than the @xmath7  quark could be responsible  @xcite for the unexpectedly sizable like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath7-hadron decays recently reported by the d collaboration  @xcite .",
    "although in these few instances the spin-1 particles tend to have suppressed couplings to sm particles , it is possible to test their existence or effects in future high - precision experiments  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we explore the possibility that a nonstandard spin-1 boson under 100gev is electrically neutral , carries no color , and has couplings to both the neutrinos and electron .",
    "consequently , it will affect processes that involve at least these leptons .",
    "in particular , we will focus on such processes for which plenty of experimental data are available . in our study , the new particle ,",
    "to which we refer as the @xmath8 boson , is not necessarily a gauge boson .",
    "therefore , its couplings to the leptons are kept sufficiently general for a model - independent analysis .",
    "the results of our analysis can be readily applied to the specific case where @xmath8 is a gauge boson or any model with definite couplings of  @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the @xmath8 boson does not mix with the sm gauge bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as alluded to earlier ,",
    "most previous nsi studies concentrate on the scenario of heavy new particles .",
    "as far as we know , the low - mass effects of @xmath8 on the determination of its couplings have not been studied in detail before .",
    "when the mass of @xmath8 is close to the momenta exchanged in a scattering process , both the exchanged momenta and the @xmath8-boson mass ( and even its total decay width ) have to be kept in the calculations .",
    "this work is complementary to analyses on neutrino nsi due to new physics above the electroweak scale  ( _ e.g. _ , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we write down an interaction lagrangian for @xmath8 with the leptons and subsequently describe the ( anti)neutrino - electron and @xmath0 scattering processes that will be used to constrain possible values of the @xmath8 couplings to the leptons . from section  [ nue ] to section  [ separate ] , we concentrate on the flavor - conserving interactions . in sections  [ nue ] and  [ anue ] , we extract constraints on the @xmath8 couplings to the electron and to the electron neutrino and antineutrino from the low - energy @xmath11 and @xmath12 data , respectively . a  combined result from the two sets of data",
    "is presented at the end of section  [ anue ] . section  [ numue ] deals with the bounds on the @xmath8 couplings to the electron and to the muon neutrinos based on the charm - ii data . in section  [ ee2nng ] ,",
    "the data on @xmath0 cross - section collected by the aleph , delphi , l3 , and opal collaborations are employed to restrict the leptonic couplings of  @xmath8 , with several illustrative choices of its mass and total decay width .",
    "we also discuss the complementarity of the ( anti)neutrino - electron and @xmath0 measurements in probing these couplings .",
    "since the @xmath8 contributions to these observables always involve the products of its respective couplings to the electron and neutrinos , the resulting constraints also apply only to the products , instead of the individual couplings .",
    "it is therefore of interest to determine constraints on the separate couplings making use of other experimental information , which is also available .",
    "we pursue this in section  [ separate ] for the flavor - conserving couplings employing @xmath13 collision data at the @xmath9-pole , the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , and the results of searches for a nonstandard spin-1 particle at fixed - target and beam - dump experiments .",
    "comparing the various results would allow us to see which observables are most sensitive to the different @xmath8 couplings .",
    "finally , in section  [ fcc ] we address constraints on the couplings for the flavor - changing @xmath8-neutrino interactions from the same sets of experimental data utilized in sections  [ nue]-[ee2nng ] .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "some longer formulas are collected in an  appendix .",
    "the lagrangian describing the effective interactions of @xmath8 with the neutrinos ,  @xmath14 , and electron ,  @xmath15 , can take the form @xmath16 where summation over @xmath17 is implied , we have allowed for the possibility of @xmath8-induced neutrino flavor - change , and @xmath18 . since presently there is still no compelling evidence for the existence of predominantly right - handed neutrinos  @xcite , we have neglected their potential couplings to  @xmath8 .",
    "we also have not included terms involving the muon or tau , as the electron is the only charged lepton taking part in the reactions we will study .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath19 implies that @xmath20 and that @xmath21 are real .",
    "in our model - independent approach , we assume that these parameters are free and can be family nonuniversal .",
    "we further assume that additional coupling constants which @xmath8 may have parametrizing its interactions , flavor - conserving and/or flavor - violating , with other fermions already satisfy the experimental constraints to which the couplings are subject , but which we do not address in this paper .    in the sm ,",
    "neutrino - electron interactions proceed from diagrams with the @xmath22 and @xmath9 bosons exchanged between the fermions .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is given by @xmath23 where as usual @xmath1 is the weak coupling constant and @xmath24 the weinberg angle .",
    "one can place bounds on the products of @xmath8 couplings to the neutrino and electron in eq.([lx ] ) from the cross sections of @xmath25 and @xmath26 scattering which have been determined in a  number of low - energy experiments  @xcite .",
    "the accumulated data are generally consistent with sm expectations , but there is room left for new physics .    in the sm ,",
    "the amplitude for @xmath27 at tree level comes from @xmath28-channel @xmath22-mediated and @xmath29-channel @xmath9-mediated diagrams , while for @xmath30 the @xmath22 contribution is absent  @xcite .",
    "for these processes , the @xmath8 interactions in eq.([lx ] ) can induce @xmath29-channel diagrams .",
    "the latter type of @xmath8-mediated diagram is the only contribution at leading order to @xmath31 for @xmath32 in the absence of other nonstandard mechanisms .",
    "since the final neutrino in the @xmath33 scattering experiments is not detected , any one of the three light - neutrino flavors can occur in the final state .",
    "it follows that for @xmath34 and @xmath35 or @xmath36 we have the differential cross - section @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote , respectively , the energy of the incident neutrino and the kinetic energy of the recoiling electron both in the laboratory frame , @xmath40 is the electron mass , and the general expressions for the squared amplitudes can be found in eqs .",
    "( [ m2nuee])-([m2nule ] ) in the appendix .    in the case that the momentum transfers in the scattering are small compared to the @xmath22 and @xmath8 masses , we can write approximately @xmath41 @xmath42 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two parts in eq.([dcs / dt ] ) arise from flavor - diagonal ( fd ) and flavor - changing ( fc ) interactions , respectively , @xmath44 as usual , @xmath45 if @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath48 , implying that @xmath49 and  @xmath50 . in the @xmath51 limit ,",
    "eq.([fd ] ) reproduces the well - known sm contribution  @xcite . for @xmath35 and @xmath52",

    "if @xmath54 is not large compared to the momentum transfer , one needs to employ the general expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ m2nuee])-([m2nule ] ) to calculate the cross sections  @xmath55 , but the approximations such as made in the previous paragraph are still applicable to the sm part for momenta much smaller than  @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath57 scattering with incident neutrinos having been produced in @xmath58 decays at rest and therefore not being monoenergetic , one has to integrate @xmath59 over the appropriate @xmath60 spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this results in the flux - averaged cross - section  @xcite @xmath61 where the limits span the @xmath60 energy range in @xmath58 decay , @xmath62mev with the @xmath63 masses neglected , and the spectrum is given by  @xcite @xmath64 , which is normalized to unity .    in the @xmath65 processes of interest ,",
    "the source of the incident antineutrinos is a  nuclear reactor and hence they do not share the same energy . the cross section",
    "then again needs to be integrated over the reactor antineutrino spectrum  @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 denote the experimental cuts on the kinetic energy @xmath39 of the recoiling electron in the lab frame , @xmath68 is a function of @xmath39 according to  eq.([enumin ] ) , and the spectrum , which extends essentially to @xmath69mev , is given by  @xcite @xmath70 the sum of the spectra @xmath71 from isotopes @xmath72 with fractional contributions  @xmath73 .",
    "the differential cross - section @xmath74 for @xmath75 large compared to the total energy in this scattering can be derived from eqs .",

    "( [ m2nuee])-([m2nule ] ) in evaluating the cross sections .",
    "additional bounds on the @xmath8 couplings to the leptons are available from @xmath0 scattering , which has been observed at  lep  @xcite .",
    "the cross section of this process has been computed in the literature for the sm  @xcite as well as its extensions containing extra charged and neutral gauge bosons  @xcite . in the sm the amplitude at tree level is generated by five diagrams , three of which are mediated by the @xmath22 and two by the  @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8 contributions are similar in form to the @xmath9 diagrams . our calculations including the @xmath8 contributions agree with the earlier results  @xcite .",
    "the cross section can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the photon energy and angle with respect to the @xmath81 or @xmath82 beam direction in the @xmath13 center - of - mass frame , @xmath83 denotes the solid angle of either @xmath63 or @xmath84 in the @xmath85 center - of - mass frame , and the formulas for the squared amplitudes are given in  eqs.([m2ee2nng])-([m2ee2nng  ] ) .",
    "our numerical analysis starts in the next section .",
    "the latest data on the cross section of @xmath87 have been acquired in the e225 experiment at lampf  @xcite and the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "they measured the flux - averaged cross - sections @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath91  @xcite with flux - averaged energy @xmath92mev , the statistical and systematic errors of each having been combined in quadrature .",
    "the sm prediction is @xmath93  @xcite , which translates into  @xmath94 .",
    "performing unconstrained averaging of the two measurements following the particle data group prescription  @xcite yields @xmath95 , leading to  @xmath96 .    to explore the constraints on the @xmath8 couplings to the leptons from this average value of  @xmath97",
    ", we adopt its 1.64-sigma [ 90% confidence level  ( cl ) ] limits and isolate the @xmath8 contribution , including its interference with the sm amplitude , by subtracting out the sm cross - section , @xmath98 , quoted above . in numerical calculations , we will take @xmath99 and  @xmath100 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we address first the flavor - conserving couplings , turning off the flavor - changing ones in this and the next four sections . assuming that the coupling products @xmath101 and @xmath102 occur at the same time in the @xmath8 contribution to the flux - averaged cross - section in eq.([facs ] ) , with the squared amplitude given by that in  eq.([mx2nuee ] ) , we try various values of the @xmath8 mass .",
    "it turns out that the allowed ranges of the ratios of these parameters to the squared @xmath8-mass become less and less dependent on @xmath54 fairly quickly if it exceeds @xmath10340mev and that below this value the effect of the low @xmath54 on the allowed regions increasingly manifests itself as @xmath54 decreases .",
    "in particular , the restrictions on the ratios grow weaker as the lighter masses get lower .",
    "we illustrate all this in  fig.[lampf+lsnd ] for several examples of @xmath54 values , where @xmath104 are the ratios normalized by @xmath105 according to the general definition @xmath106 it is worth noting that , since in this reaction the magnitude of the momentum exchange in the @xmath8 diagram is less than @xmath107mev , the application of the approximate formula in eq.([csnue ] ) for @xmath108mev would entail errors of more than @xmath109 .     and @xmath110 subject to constraints from lampf and lsnd data on  @xmath11 scattering for , from largest to smallest rings ,  @xmath111  mev .",
    "the yellow ( most lightly - shaded ) ring , for  @xmath112mev , is virtually identical to that for any other  @xmath113mev.[lampf+lsnd],width=275 ]",
    ".experimental results on @xmath65 scattering cross section @xmath115 or event rate @xmath116 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our framework , the @xmath8-mediated amplitude for the flavor - changing decay @xmath117 proceeds from a one - loop diagram for @xmath118 involving internal @xmath22 , @xmath14 , and @xmath119 lines with @xmath8 attached to the neutrino lines and eventually transforming  into @xmath13 . since the masses of the external and internal leptons are small relative to  @xmath56 , it is a good approximation to retain only the lowest order terms in the small - mass expansion . in that limit",
    ", we can employ the results of ref.@xcite to derive @xmath120 after dropping a divergent term depending on the internal neutrino mass which in the complete model would be canceled by other contributions , assuming the presence of a gim - like mechanism in the lepton sector of the model , and neglecting the final lepton masses .",
    "this implies that we only have an order - of - magnitude estimate of the decay branching ratio , given by @xmath121 this is very suppressed for @xmath122ev .    0 j.  beringer",
