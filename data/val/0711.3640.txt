    "recently , baryon acoustic oscillations have been observed in the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "these observations include an analysis of the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) spectroscopic sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e05 , hereafter ) , the power spectrum of the two - degree field ( 2df ) galaxy redshift survey @xcite and the sdss lrg @xcite , and the angular power spectrum of the sdss lrg sample with photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "there is a hint of acoustic oscillations in the sdss quasar sample @xcite .",
    "these analyses have established the ability of the baryon acoustic oscillations to constrain cosmological parameters competitively and complementarily with the cmb ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "these previous analyses of the baryon oscillations , however , use angle - averaged 2pcfs , @xmath7 , or angle - averaged power spectra , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the separation and wavenumber in redshift space , respectively .",
    "a certain amount of information is lost when anisotropies of structure are ignored . in their pioneering work ,",
    "@xcite proposed that geometrical anisotropies in redshift space of the high - z universe can be used as a probe of the cosmological constant .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that the anisotropy of the 2pcf and the power spectrum in redshift surveys can constrain the dark energy components .",
    "recently , methods which directly use anisotropy of the baryon acoustic oscillations have been theoretically developed for both the power spectrum @xcite and the 2pcf @xcite .",
    "these approaches use functions of two variables : separations parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "observationally , estimations of such two - variable functions are noisier than one - variable functions .",
    "the baryon acoustic signature in the large - scale structure is weak even in one - variable statistics when presently available samples of galaxies are used ( see , e.g. , e05 ) .",
    "therefore , methods that directly treat the anisotropy of the baryon acoustic feature require very large survey volume @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite measured the 2pcf with two variables from the 2dfgrs @xcite and detected the detailed signature of large - scale coherent infall , and as a result were able to constrain a value of @xmath11 which parameterizes linear redshift distortions .",
    "however , they used information from scales much smaller than the acoustic scale because of limited survey volume and did not analyze the effect of geometrical distortion . on the other hand , the correlation analyses of the 2df qso survey placed constraints on the cosmological constant ( hoyle et al .",
    "2002 ; outram et al .",
    "2004 ; da ngela et al .  2005",
    "; see also ross et al .",
    "their analyses still focused on smaller scales than the baryon acoustic scale .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the anisotropic 2pcf , including the baryon acoustic peak in the large - scale structure and constrain relevant cosmological parameters .",
    "we use a spectroscopic sample of the sdss lrg , which is the most useful sample for our purpose .",
    "our analysis differs from previous studies of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lrg sample in that , owing to a theoretical development by @xcite , we take into consideration the fully two - dimensional feature in the 2pcf to detect a geometrical distortion effect ; this is the first cosmological application of the two - dimensional acoustic peaks .    before proceeding to the next section , we take note of nonlinearity on large scales and the scale dependence of the galaxy biasing .",
    "the nonlinear effects on the baryonic features that appear around @xmath12 play an important role in taking account of percent - level cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent work also suggests that the scale - dependent biasing poses a serious problem in analyzing galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we consider only the large - scale clustering and assume the biasing to be scale - independent and linear .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in   [ sec : sdss ] we describe the sdss lrg sample used in our analysis .",
    "we then , in   [ sec:2pcf ] , measure the anisotropic 2pcf in redshift space and estimate its covariance matrix . in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] we outline the cosmological parameter dependence on the modeled 2pcf , including dynamical and geometrical distortions .",
    "cosmological parameters are constrained by the measured anisotropic 2pcf in   [ sec : parameter ] . in   [ sec : conclusion ] our conclusions are given .",
    "the sdss @xcite is an ongoing imaging and redshift survey which uses a dedicated 2.5 m telescope , a mosaic ccd camera , and two fiber - fed double spectrographs @xcite . after image processing @xcite and calibration @xcite ,",
    "the spectroscopic targets of lrgs are selected from the imaging data according to the algorithm described by @xcite . the tiling algorithm for the fibers",
    "is found in @xcite .    for our analysis",
    ", we use 46,760 lrgs over @xmath13 in the redshift range from 0.16 to 0.47 , which is the same sample as the one used in previous analyses of sdss lrg clustering ( zehavi et al . 2005 ; e05 ) .",
    "the sky coverage is the same as lss_sample14 @xcite and is similar to that of the publicly available sdss data release 3 @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in the sample have rest - frame _ g_-band absolute magnitudes @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with @xmath16 corrections of passively evolved galaxies to a fiducial redshift of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the comoving number density of the sample is close to constant out to @xmath18 ( i.e. , volume limited ) because of the narrow absolute magnitude cut , and drops thereafter due to the flux limits ( see fig",
    ". 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the radial and angular selection functions , fiber collisions , and unobserved plates are modeled using the method described in @xcite ; e05 also provides the details of the sample .",
    "the 2pcf is measured by comparing the actual galaxy distribution to a catalogue of randomly distributed points in the same region , according to the selection function of the survey @xcite .",
    "we count the galaxy pairs in bins of comoving separation along and across the line of sight , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , to estimate the anisotropic 2pcf .",
    "our notations of geometric quantities are illustrated in figure  [ fig : coordinate_z ] .",
    "first , the comoving distances to every galaxy , @xmath21 , are calculated by assuming a flat universe with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass density parameter and @xmath25 is the cosmological constant parameter .",
    "this flat universe is used only as a mapping between the observed space and our analysis space : our theoretical modeling also takes this mapping into account .",
    "the purpose of the mapping is simply to avoid having to perform the analysis in strongly distorted redshift space . for each galaxy with redshift @xmath26",
    "we define the separations @xmath27 and @xmath28 of other galaxies with redshift @xmath29 according to figure  [ fig : coordinate_z ] : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the apparent angle between the two galaxies from the observer .",
    "this definition of the line of sight is not as standard as that of @xmath32 , such as was defined by davis & peebles ( 1983 ; see also fisher et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "which galaxy of the pair is chosen as galaxy 1 is arbitrary in our definition .",
    "both galaxies are considered as galaxy 1 , and the line of sight is simply defined as the direction toward the galaxy 1 .",
    "therefore we count a pair of galaxies twice . as a result",
    ", there appears a strong correlation between certain bins in @xmath33 space ; in particular , the bins of opposite sign of @xmath27 are strongly correlated .",
    "those bins contain almost identical pairs in a small - angle case , @xmath34 .",
    "however , the angle @xmath31 in our sample is not always this small , so that those bins contain different sets of pairs .",
    "still the correlations between those bins are strong , which is properly taken into account in our parameter estimation below .",
    "we compute the anisotropic 2pcf using the landy - szalay estimator @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the normalized counts of galaxy - galaxy , random - random , and galaxy - random pairs , respectively , in a particular bin in the space of @xmath39 .",
    "the random catalogue contains about 30 times as many points as the real data , and the random points are distributed according to the radial and angular selection functions .",
    "the space of @xmath39 is divided into rectangular cells with @xmath40 .",
    "each galaxy of redshift @xmath41 is weighted by @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 is the comoving number density and @xmath44 is the power spectrum at a typical scale @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath45 , which is evaluated at the baryon wiggle scale and is the same value as e05 .",
    "we have also tried another value , @xmath46 , adopted by @xcite .",
    "we found that the value does not have a strong effect on the result , as noted in @xcite , because the comoving number density of our sample is close to constant at almost all scales .",
    "the resulting redshift - space 2pcf for the observed lrgs is shown in the right half of the plane in figure  [ fig : xi_lrg_2d ] .",
    "the value of @xmath47 are given by contour lines .",
    "there is an indication of the baryon ridges of radius about @xmath12 , which is a counterpart of the baryon peak in the one - dimensional 2pcf , although the signal is not so strong .",
    "the anisotropy of the clustering is obvious in this figure . when the separation is along the line of sight ( @xmath48 ) , the clustering is elongated due to nonlinear velocity dispersions of galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the large - scale clustering is squashed along the line of sight due to coherent infalls toward over - dense regions @xcite .",
    "the latter effect is often called the kaiser s effect . a corresponding theoretical prediction based on a linear perturbation theory derived by @xcite",
    "is shown in the left half of the plane in figure  [ fig : xi_lrg_2d ] .",
    "although the measured 2pcf is noisy , the linear theory can account for the behavior of the 2pcf on large scales .",
    "the nonlinear velocity distortions are not described by linear dynamics , which should be removed in our linear analysis below .",
    "the detailed comparison clearly needs statistical treatment , which we explain below .",
    "when the anisotropic 2pcf is averaged over the angle , the one - dimensional 2pcf @xmath7 is obtained .      because there are strong correlations between different bins of the anisotropic 2pcf , it is necessary for statistically proper analyses to estimate a covariance matrix . for this purpose , jackknife resampling or bootstrap resampling ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is often adopted . in a cosmological context , however , cosmic variance plays a critical role in estimates of cosmological parameters .",
    "it is uncertain whether these methods can provide a reliable estimator of the cosmic variance because they rely only on one observed sample .",
    "we first tried to use the jackknife method and found that this approach actually underestimates the covariance at all the scales , which leads to the underestimation of the error bars for cosmological parameters when we compare them with a more reliable method explained below . a similar tendency is also seen by @xcite .",
    "one of the best ways to estimate the covariance matrix including cosmic variance is to use n - body simulations to generate many mock catalogs from which the covariance matrix is calculated .",
    "it is necessary to generate a larger number of mock samples than the number of data points of the statistics to be employed ; otherwise , one would improperly obtain a singular covariance matrix . however , because our analysis of the anisotropic 2pcf deals with several hundred data points , it is computationally too expensive to produce a sufficient number of independent realizations in our case .",
    "in our analysis we adopt an alternative method , using a public second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) code @xcite . as input ingredients ,",
    "we adopt @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 particles in a cubic box of side @xmath54 , and a transfer function calculated by cmbfast code @xcite with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the hubble parameter normalized by @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the rms . of the fluctuations smoothed with a top - hat window function of radius @xmath59 , and @xmath60",
    "is the baryon density parameter . to implant the galaxy biasing of the lrgs @xcite",
    ", we empirically select particles with probability proportional to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mass density fluctuation at a position of each particle calculated by the university of washington hpcc s public smooth code .",
    "we choose @xmath63 so as to match the correlation amplitude of the observed lrgs at scales larger than @xmath64 .",
    "then we trim the mock catalogs from simulation boxes so as to have the same number density and the same survey volume as the actual lrg sample .",
    "finally , we generate 2500 mock catalogs with independent initial conditions , compute the 2pcf for each , and obtain a covariance matrix by @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 represents the value of the 2pcf of @xmath68th bin in @xmath69th realization , and @xmath70 is the mean value of @xmath71 over realizations .",
    "the average of 2pcfs from each mock catalog agrees well with the observation within the @xmath72 errors for both one - dimensional ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_2lpt_1d ] ) and two - dimensional analyses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_2lpt_2d ] ) .",
    "these mock catalogs are constructed solely to estimate errors of the measured 2pcf of lrgs , so the averaged 2pcf over the catalogs is not used for the following analyses .",
    "increasing @xmath73 changes the amplitude at the scales around the baryon peak to match the observation , while it causes more discrepancy at the small scales .",
    "this tendency is , however , consistent with the theoretical prediction ( see figure 3 in e05 ) .",
    "we test the full covariance matrix obtained by the 2lpt method .",
    "first , we randomly choose the 2pcfs of 30 realizations out of 2500 .",
    "we regard each of 30 2pcfs as an observed lrg sample , calculate the @xmath74 statistics by the method described in ",
    "[ sec : parameter ] , constrain the input cosmological parameters , @xmath75 and @xmath56 , and check how many realizations contain the input values at @xmath76 and @xmath77 confidence level .",
    "if the amplitude of covariance is reasonable , @xmath76 of all the contours of @xmath76 confidence levels should contain the input parameters .",
    "the reason for using only 30 realizations is that comparing against all the mock catalogs is computationally very expensive ; it requires that @xmath74 be calculated in seven dimensional parameter space 2500 times .",
    "according to our statistics , anisotropic 2pcf @xmath78 , there are 22 and 28 realizations which contain the inputs at @xmath76 and @xmath77 confidence levels for @xmath75 in the total 30 realizations , while there are 17 and 28 for @xmath56 .",
    "we thus conclude that our method of estimating the covariance matrix is reasonable , and can be reliably applied for parameter estimation in  [ sec : parameter ] .",
    "figure [ fig : cov_realization ] shows the result of the test ; we choose to present only 15 realizations because displaying all 30 results makes the figure unclear .",
    "as a theoretical prediction for the anisotropic 2pcf , we adopt an analytical formula of @xcite derived in a general situation taking into account the wide - angle effect @xcite and the high - z distortion effect @xcite in linear perturbation theory .",
    "the necessary formula is given in @xcite .",
    "the mean redshift of the lrg sample is about @xmath79 and the clustering scale which we probe ranges up to @xmath80 .",
    "the maximum angle between two points from the observer ( @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinate_z ] ) is @xmath81 .",
    "the distant - observer approximation is not so accurate at @xmath82 , and therefore the general formula give above , which accurately includes the wide - angle effect , is preferable for a precise analysis of the lrg sample .",
    "the left side of figure  [ fig : xi_lrg_2d ] shows a prediction in linear theory of the two - dimensional 2pcf in redshift space with the central redshift of @xmath83 .",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the equation - of - state parameter for the dark energy component and @xmath89 is the linear bias parameter .",
    "the first five values are our best - fit values for the two - dimensional 2pcf of lrgs , as described in the following section , while the last two are the fiducial values .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmology for simplicity .",
    "there are seven cosmological parameters in our modeling : @xmath75 , @xmath56 , @xmath60 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath58 , and @xmath89 . for the details of the dependence of the anisotropic 2pcf on cosmological parameters ,",
    "see @xcite . in short",
    ", there are three kinds of physical effects .",
    "the first one is the shape of the underlying mass power spectrum , which is determined by the @xmath75 , @xmath60 , @xmath56 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the second one is the dynamical distortion effect which is generated by peculiar velocities of galaxies .",
    "linear , coherent velocities squash the apparent clustering along the line of sight , while nonlinear , random velocities smear the clustering along the same direction @xcite .",
    "the linear squashing effect depends on the so - called redshift distortion factor , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate @xmath94 at redshift @xmath41 , @xmath95 is the scale factor , and @xmath96 is the linear bias factor at redshift @xmath41 .",
    "the growth factor depends on @xmath75 and @xmath91 .",
    "since we assume a flat cosmology , the density parameter of dark energy is given by @xmath97 .",
    "however , the parameter dependence on the growth factor is not so useful in parameter estimation , because the overall amplitude of the power spectrum characterized by @xmath58 is a free parameter .",
    "since the parameter dependence of nonlinear velocity effect is not analytically given , we do not use the nonlinear regime in the 2pcf .",
    "the third effect is the geometric distortion , which depends on the hubble parameter @xmath98 , and angular diameter distance , @xmath99 , and thus depends on @xmath75 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the dependence of the geometric distortion on @xmath56 vanishes in redshift surveys in which distances are measured in units of @xmath100 .",
    "the geometric distortion is useful for constraining the dark - energy parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath91 .",
    "the baryon ridges are isotropic in comoving space and their anisotropy is primarily due to geometric distortion .    finally , we comment on the galaxy biasing and the evolutionary effect . because we consider only the linear regime , we assume the biasing to be scale - independent and linear . although the bias parameter @xmath89 is completely degenerate with @xmath58 in the ordinary one - dimensional 2pcf , the two - dimensional 2pcf is able to solve this degeneracy through the measurement of the redshift distortion parameter , @xmath102 , which depends on @xmath89 .",
    "we treat @xmath89 and @xmath58 as independent parameters in the following analysis .",
    "one could choose @xmath102 or @xmath103 as free parameters ( which are more closely related to the measurements ) , instead of @xmath89 or @xmath58 .",
    "the choice of the independent parameters does not affect the following result .",
    "in this paper we consider the measured 2pcf as a representative of the function at a mean redshift @xmath104 .",
    "we therefore simply neglect the effects of evolution on clustering and biasing within the sample . strictly speaking ,",
    "evolutionary effects are not negligible in very large redshift surveys which have broad range of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the evolution has a significant effect in the sdss quasar sample @xcite . in our lrg sample",
    ", however , the redshift range is relatively small and the signal - to - noise ratio of the measured 2pcf is not very high .",
    "indeed , the evolutionary effect on the growth factor is about less than 20% from the survey edge to the mean redshift , but the effects on the anisotropic 2pcf and cosmological parameters are negligibly small compared to error levels .",
    "in this section we describe methods and results of constraining cosmological parameters by the anisotropic 2pcf of the lrg sample .",
    "we measure the goodness of fit , which shows how well assumed cosmological parameters fit a set of observational data , and the measurements are given by the @xmath74 statistics , taking into account the full covariance matrix .",
    "as described in the previous section , we adopt seven free parameters @xmath75 ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath60 , @xmath56 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath58 , and @xmath89 , assuming flatness of the universe .    in comparing observational data with theory ,",
    "we first compute the theoretical 2pcf as a function of @xmath106 with a given set of parameters .",
    "next we use the fiducial parameters of @xmath107 and @xmath23 to convert redshifts into comoving distances , which are the same values assumed for measuring the distances of each galaxy in ",
    "[ sec : measure_2pcf ] .",
    "therefore , we compare the theoretical 2pcf with the observation in the same comoving space and these fiducial parameters do not bias our results of parameter estimations . the theoretical formula based on the linear perturbation theory",
    "does not reproduce nonlinear gravitational effects and nonlinear velocity distortions such as finger - of - god effects .",
    "we therefore discard the observed 2pcf at scales less than 40@xmath108 .",
    "we also do not use the data along the line - of - sight , namely , @xmath109 , because the line - of - sight components of the 2pcf are noisy @xcite and furthermore deviate from kaiser s formula even on large scales @xcite .",
    "finally we perform the analysis for the scale range of @xmath3 .",
    "we also adopt a more conservative range @xmath110 to check the systematic effects beyond the linear theory .",
    "the numbers of bins in 2pcf are 574 for @xmath3 and 330 for @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath74 statistics are then calculated as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a set of cosmological parameters to be constrained , @xmath113 denotes the difference between the observed and theoretical 2pcfs in _ i_th bin , and the sum is over the number of bins .",
    "the most likely values for the cosmological parameters minimize the equation ( [ eq : chi2_general ] ) . finally , the likelihood function for the cosmological parameters , @xmath114 , is proportional to @xmath115 with an appropriate normalization factor .",
    "then , for example , the 68% confidence interval becomes the region where @xmath116 in the parameter space .",
    "first , we consider the behavior of the parameters related to the clustering amplitude , @xmath58 and @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ fig : l_s8_bi ] plots their joint likelihood functions with contours representing 68% , 95% and 99% confidence levels , where @xmath87 is fixed and we marginalize over the other four parameters @xmath75 , @xmath60 , @xmath56 , and @xmath117 .",
    "we find @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( 68% confidence level ) for the fit to @xmath3 after also marginalizing them over each other .",
    "as described in   [ sec : theory ] , @xmath89 and @xmath58 are strongly coupled as the amplitude of the 2pcf is proportional to a product @xmath103 .",
    "the degeneracy is somewhat alleviated from anisotropy of the 2pcf due to dynamical distortions which are dependent on @xmath102 .",
    "it is still difficult , however , to independently constrain these two parameters without relying on other observations such as cmb , higher order correlation analysis , etc . in this paper",
    "we mainly focus on parameter constraints only from the 2pcf and consider the joint analysis with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _  ) results only in   [ sec : wmap ] .",
    "therefore , we always marginalize over both @xmath58 and @xmath89 in the following likelihood analysis .",
    "this marginalization corresponds to mainly using the shape information in the 2pcf and discarding the amplitude information .",
    "we also note that the physical origins of the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath58 are not fully understood .",
    "the value of the bias parameter @xmath89 depends on unknown details concerning the formation of lrgs , and the value of @xmath58 depends on unknown details about the generation of density fluctuations in the primordial universe .",
    "there is not any reliable theory which robustly predicts the values of these parameters .",
    "we next focus on the four fundamental cosmological parameters @xmath75 , @xmath60 , @xmath56 , and @xmath90 after marginalizing over @xmath58 and @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ fig : l_m0_b0_h0 ] illustrates contour plots of the joint likelihood functions of two parameters among the four , where @xmath91 is fixed at @xmath120 .",
    "the fits to @xmath3 give @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 ( @xmath76 cl ) .",
    "the best - fit values and the errors of all the cosmological parameters are listed in table [ tb : bestfit ] .",
    "the best - fit values of all of the four parameters for @xmath125 and @xmath110 are consistent within the range of the @xmath76 error .",
    "this result suggests that the systematic effects beyond the linear theory are small .",
    "the accuracy of the constraints on @xmath75 and @xmath60 increases by nearly a factor of 2 while the uncertainty of @xmath56 is improved only marginally when the wider dynamical range is used .",
    "we obtain a relatively strong constraint on @xmath75 without fixing the value of @xmath60 because the constraint from the linear squashing effect in the anisotropic 2pcf is stronger than in the spherically averaged 2pcf .",
    "in addition , the best - fit value of @xmath75 is in quite good agreement with an independent analysis of the lrgs by @xcite using a power spectrum that yields @xmath126 with a dynamical range of @xmath127 . our result also agrees with those from the cmb angular power spectra from _ wmap _  @xcite .",
    "we note that the best - fit value of @xmath75 is smaller ( but not significantly so ) than the result of e05 , @xmath128 .",

    "a possible reason for this is that discarding the small - scale data makes the constraints on @xmath169 degenerate along the direction of constant acoustic scales ( see fig .",
    "8 of e05 ) and this direction is fairly parallel to the lines of constant @xmath75 but intersects with the lines of constant @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "10 of e05 ) .",
    "constraining the dark energy is one of the most interesting applications of the anisotropic 2pcf . as described in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we use the information from not only the overall shape of the 2pcf but also the geometrical distortion with baryon ridges to constrain the dark energy component .",
    "as @xcite indicated , the lrg sample is one of the best samples for probing the feature of dark energy among current redshift surveys .",
    "however , it is still difficult for the relatively low-@xmath41 survey to constrain not only the value of @xmath91 but also its evolution . in this subsection",
    ", we therefore assume @xmath91 to be a constant not necessarily equal to @xmath120 and fix @xmath170 because the baryon density is highly constrained by the analysis of the _ wmap _  data @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : l_l0_w0 ] we plot the joint likelihood functions of @xmath101 and @xmath91 and obtain @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the fit to @xmath3 .",
    "all the other parameters but @xmath171 are marginalized over .",
    "our constraints on dark energy parameters are listed in table [ tb : bestfit ] .",
    "we also plot the likelihood function in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : l_l0_w0 ] where the no - wiggle power spectrum @xcite is used to calculate the analytical formula for the anisotropic 2pcf . because the dark energy parameter is constrained only from the overall shape of the 2pcf in this way and degenerates with the other parameters without information from the acoustic scale , we obtain a poorer fit to the data .",
    "therefore , the overall shape is not a dominant effect in constraining the dark energy parameter , and the baryon ridges contribute as well .",
    "so far we have focused on parameter constraints using the lrg data only , which are very useful to check its result independently , while the obtained constraints are inevitably weaker than those we would obtain when other data sets are combined . in this subsection",
    "we consider the additional constraints using the cmb prior from the 3 year _ wmap _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "we consider two markov chain monte carlo results of the _ wmap _  data , @xmath87 and constant @xmath91 cosmologies @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 from the former chain , while @xmath178 and @xmath179 from the latter .",
    "these constraints are also summarized in table [ tb : bestfit ] and are in very good agreement with the previous studies for the joint constraints of the _ wmap _  observation with the large - scale structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although a pure lrg analysis can not tightly constrain @xmath169 or @xmath56 because of the limited range of separations , they are significantly improved by the prior on the cmb acoustic scale .",
    "we have presented the 2pcf in redshift - space for the sdss luminous red galaxy sample considering the anisotropy in 2d redshift space . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the distorted features of the 2pcf in redshift - space from both peculiar velocities of galaxies and geometrical effect .",
    "the distorted features of the kaiser and finger - of - god effects were clearly detected .",
    "the baryon ridges , which are the baryonic acoustic features in the anisotropic 2pcf , are a nearly spherical object in comoving space .",
    "we found indications of baryon ridges in the measured 2pcf . beyond qualitative comparison between data and theory , evaluation of the covariance matrix",
    "is needed for cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "we constructed the matrix by generating mock samples using the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory with an artificial biasing scheme .",
    "we have constrained the cosmological parameters by comparing the observed 2pcf with linear theory .",
    "we have obtained constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath124 when we have used the data of @xmath3 .",
    "the constraint on @xmath75 was better mainly because of the clear detection of the kaiser effect , which directly depends on @xmath75 through @xmath102 .",
    "we have also obtained the constraints on the dark energy as @xmath182 and @xmath6 when we fix @xmath4 and the other parameters , @xmath56 , @xmath183 , @xmath58 , and @xmath89 are marginalized over .",
    "these constraints are mainly due to the overall shape of the anisotropic 2pcf and the information from geometrical distortions including the scale of the baryon ridge .",
    "we have demonstrated that a pure lrg analysis can constrain @xmath91 by considering the anisotropy of the structure accurately . as for the parameters related to the clustering amplitude , we have obtained @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "while these two parameters are strongly coupled , the degeneracy was alleviated from anisotropy of the 2pcf through the redshift distortion factor , @xmath102 .",
    "in addition , stronger constraints on the cosmological parameters above were obtained by the cmb prior from the 3 year _ wmap _  results .",
    "all the constraints summarized above agree with the previous studies in literature .",
    "the current analysis can be improved by considering two issues below .",
    "the first issue is theoretical improvement accounting for the nonlinearity of the gravitational evolution , the redshift distortions and the galaxy biasing .",
    "although the baryonic signature emerges on very large scales , the width of the baryon peak in the 2pcf is an order of @xmath184mpc .",
    "the nonlinearities nontrivially affect such a feature .",
    "in fact , such effects have already been investigated using @xmath185-body simulations , higher - order perturbation theories , and renormalization perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the degradation of the acoustic signature was well modeled ; it was shown that the acoustic peak of the linear density field in the 2pcf can be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "in addition , the overall shape of the redshift - space 2pcf is also affected by nonlinear dynamics @xcite . according to his result , the redshift - space 2pcf for pairs parallel to the line of sight in a random gaussian field deviates from the prediction of standard linear theory even on fairly large scales . in this work",
    "we do not use the data along the line of sight ; however , we shall include these issues in the future analysis .",
    "the theoretical and numerical studies also suggest that the biasing is potentially scale dependent even on large scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which poses a serious problem for estimating cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the second issue is the calculation of the covariance matrix for the measured 2pcf .",
    "as described in   [ sec : covariance ] , we have constructed a covariance matrix by the second - order perturbation theory . using n - body simulations which fully include nonlinearity provides better estimation of the covariance matrix .",
    "however , this approach is too computationally expensive to produce a large number of independent realizations .",
    "the approximation by the second - order perturbation theory is valid on scales which we consider in this work .",
    "however , in order to utilize the information at smaller scales for more accurate cosmological parameter estimation , we must estimate the nonlinearities more accurately using @xmath185-body simulations or more sophisticated methods such as a halo occupation model from the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most important point of our analysis is that we directly include anisotropies of the structure .",
    "the baryonic features enable to divide the effect of the redshift distortions into dynamical and geometrical components .",
    "the anisotropy due to the geometric distortion , in particular , contributes to better estimation of the equation - of - state parameter for the dark energy .",
    "various methods using the scale of the oscillations as a standard ruler have been considered for both the power spectrum and the 2pcf @xcite .",
    "this work is the first application of the anisotropy in the 2pcf with baryon acoustic features to observational data , which was proposed by @xcite .",
    "direct measurement of the growth function from the kaiser s effect and the two - dimensional acoustic scales which depend on @xmath99 and @xmath98 is also an attractive challenge of the analysis using the anisotropic 2pcf , so these topics will be definitely pursued in future work with an improved lrg sample .",
    "the baryonic signature from the redshift range of sdss lrgs is not strong , because their number density is relatively small and nonlinear effects weaken the baryonic feature .",
    "there are many plans for constraining the dark energy by future wide - field , deep galaxy surveys : the fiber multiobject spectrograph ( fmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wide - field multiobject spectrograph ( wfmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , baryon oscillation probe ( bop ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the hobby - eberly dark energy experiment ( hetdex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so on .",
    "when the baryonic signature is detected with high accuracy from future redshift surveys , the analysis of the anisotropic 2pcf as in this work will be an important ingredient for stringently constraining properties of the dark energy .",
