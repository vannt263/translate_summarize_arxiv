    "the advent of quantum information and quantum technology has brought us to a deeper understanding of the basics of quantum mechanics . as a result ,",
    "various fundamental aspects , such as equilibration  @xcite , simulability  @xcite , and even foundations  @xcite , have been revised .",
    "this framework has provided both valuable insight into the foundations and new technological achievements . but theory and its related experiments have advanced asymmetrically mainly due to the impossibility to isolate completely the experimental setup , leaving the system ` open ' and exposed to decoherence  @xcite .",
    "many quantum open systems problems can be solved after assumptions are made .",
    "the widely used born - markov approximation , successfully applied to describe many physical situations  @xcite , is associated with both a memory - less environment and a weak coupling between system and environment . however ,",
    "recently , interest in quantum open systems where this assumption no longer applies  usually called non - markovian ( nm ) evolution  has flourished  @xcite .",
    "a natural question to ask is to what extent the dynamical properties of the environment can extend the validity of the born - markov approximation , even beyond the weak coupling regime . in other words ,",
    "how well does a chaotic environment reproduce markovian evolution . in this paper",
    ", we address this question analytically and numerically by means of a probe qubit coupled to a generic environment where different degrees of chaos can be tested . exploring the time evolution of non - markovianity measures ,",
    "we show that the stronger the chaos in the environment , the more markovian the evolution is .",
    "we build upon previous knowledge  @xcite of measurable quantities such as the fidelity amplitude which can be directly related to recently proposed measures of nm behavior . moreover , we establish that the short time behavior of the fidelity amplitude determines the characteristics of the qualitative nm behavior .",
    "the lingering , long time contributions , are finite size effects which contribute only as a linear term with a slope that goes to zero as the environment size goes to infinity .",
    "the remaining non - markovianity is thus size independent and due to short time revivals in the fidelity amplitude decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] we describe the system we use for our analysis .",
    "it consists of a qubit in the presence of an environment whose evolution is subject to the state of the qubit . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we briefly describe the non - markovianity measure based on distinguishability and its relation to the fidelity decay of the environment .",
    "the numerical results and analysis are done in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] and we present some concluding remarks in sect .",
    "[ sect5 ] .",
    "we consider a system - environment situation , whose hilbert space is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote system and environment .",
    "any hamiltonian can then be split as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is real and controls the strength of the interaction between system and environment .",
    "we further restrict to the case in which @xmath5 represents a qubit , i.e. when @xmath6 , and we call @xmath7 . the choice of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) results in different physical situations .",
    "however , instead of specifying the particular form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we shall impose two general conditions .",
    "the first one involves the nature of the interaction .",
    "we shall assume that it is factorizable , i.e. that @xmath8 .",
    "such structure appears in a wide variety of situations , including ising interaction and atom - field interaction under various approximations @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is to consider that the evolution of the central system , @xmath5 , either occurs at much smaller time scales than that in which decoherence occurs or that it is a multiple of @xmath9 . in the former",
    ", one can safely ignore the contribution to the dynamics , and in the latter case , @xmath10 can be included in the interaction term and can keep the factorizable structure unaffected .",
    "this occurs , e.g. in the case of a strong magnetic field applied to a set of interacting spins and thus is of particular importance in , among others , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "in this situation , one can write @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 acting only on the environment and both @xmath14 , @xmath15 being projectors onto some orthonormal basis of the qubit . this hamiltonian has already been introduced in @xcite and can be interpreted as having an environment whose evolution is conditioned by the state of the qubit .",
    "the initial state of the system shall be @xmath16 .",
    "notice that the only condition imposed on the initial state is that it be a product state .",
    "the evolution of the qubit is @xmath17\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is convenient to rephrase eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhot ] ) in terms of a quantum channel @xmath20\\ ] ] notice that although @xmath21 results from tracing out the environment it still depends on @xmath22 .    the matrix elements of the channel induced by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhot ] ) , in the pauli basis are @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{eq : lambda}\\ ] ] if we take @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the channel takes the simple form @xmath26 & \\im[f(t)]&0\\\\ 0 & \\im[f(t ) ] & \\re[f(t ) ] & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{eq : paudepha}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 $ ] being the expectation value of the echo operator .",
    "if @xmath28 is a pure state @xcite then @xmath29 is the loschmidt echo ( le ) @xcite  also called fidelity  originally proposed to measure sensitivity to perturbations in the hamiltonian as a signature of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the le decays as a function of time and the  more or less  universal decay regimes have been extensively studied ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the environment could in fact be in a pure state ",
    "e.g. in a thermal ground state at zero temperature .",
    "however it is probably easier to imagine the environment being in a mixed state ",
    "e.g. at thermal equilibrium at a given temperature .",
    "we choose then the environment to be in the maximally mixed state , i.e. proportional to the identity . in that case",
    "we obtain the real and imaginary part of the average fidelity amplitude ( afa ) , @xmath30\\ ] ] i.e. the average value of the echo operator with respect to an orthonormal basis .",
    "we remark that the choice of basis ( or any complete set ) is arbitrary .",
    "this fact contrasts the case of the le where the _ kind _ of states in the set is crucial  @xcite .",
    "during a classical markovian process the distance between two initial distributions decreases monotonically .",
    "deviations from this behavior are a landmark of non - markovianity .",
    "breuer  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used this property to _ define _ a measure of nm behavior in a quantum setting .",
    "the distance can be chosen as to link non - markovianity with distinguishability of states and thus information flow between the system and its surroundings .",
    "such a measure is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rate of change of the trace distance @xmath33 between initial states @xmath34 . in @xcite two other measures",
    "were proposed , based on deviation of semi - group properties of quantum flows . both study the physicality of the induced instant map at intermediate times , one via the jamiokowski isomorphism and the other via the entanglement ( as measured with the concurrence ) with an ancilla qubit .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for channels like eq .",
    "( [ eq : paudepha ] ) the measure induced by the entanglement is proportional to @xmath35 .    in our case , the states that maximize @xmath35 are @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , leading to @xmath38 in other words , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mconf ] ) means that nm behavior is directly related to the positive derivative of the afa as a function of time .    for fully chaotic systems both the afa and the le saturate around a value that depends on @xmath39 .",
    "after saturation sets in , the state is approximately random and the value of both fidelity and fidelity amplitude fluctuate . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect the nm measure to grow indefinitely .",
    "thus in our calculations of @xmath35 we modify the original definition in @xcite and calculate the nm measure up to a certain time .",
    "regardless , the measure at time @xmath40 still holds its meaning , i.e. the larger @xmath41 means the distance between the two states has ceased to decrease ( or increased ) more in that period of time , which implies a more nm behavior .",
    "now we consider the long standing question of the relation between chaos and markovianity . to do so we model the environment using simple but fully featured systems : quantum maps on the torus .",
    "the quantization of the torus implies that both position and momentum are discretized and the effective planck constant is the inverse of the hilbert space dimension @xmath42 . in this",
    "setting , a quantum map is simply a unitary @xmath43 acting on an @xmath42 dimensional hilbert space .     for the pcm ( top ) and the hm ( bottom ) .",
    "top : ( squares ) @xmath44 , ( circles)@xmath45 , ( triangles ) @xmath46 .",
    "( diamonds ) @xmath44 , @xmath48 ( weak coupling ) .",
    "bottom : ( squares ) @xmath49 ( regular ) , ( circles ) @xmath50 ( mixed ) , ( triangle ) @xmath51 ( fully chaotic ) .",
    "top inset : ( diamonds ) weak coupling case .",

    "the slopes of the straight lines are @xmath53 ( top panel , dashed ) and @xmath54 ( bottom inset , dot - dash ) . @xmath55 .",
    "[ fig : uno ] ]    we consider two different maps .",
    "first , the quantum perturbed cat map ( pcm ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the generators of periodic position and momentum translations on the torus with discrete eigenvalues @xmath59 , @xmath60 ,  , @xmath61 .",
    "the subindex @xmath62 denotes the depth of the kicking potential . for @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "it is the quantum version of arnold s cat map , a uniformly hyperbolic and mixing map of the torus onto itself , which is a paradigmatic example of chaos in two dimensions .",
    "the positive lyapunov exponent @xmath65 , which determines the rate of exponential divergence of classical trajectories , is uniform over the whole phase space .",
    "we explore different degrees of chaos by changing @xmath66 since , for small @xmath62 , @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 where now @xmath40 is an integer , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the other map we consider is @xmath71 which corresponds to the harper map ( hm ) @xcite .",
    "it is an approximation of the motion of an electron in a crystal under the action of an external field @xcite . for @xmath72 , the dynamics described by the associated classical map is regular , while for @xmath73 there are no remaining visible regular islands .",
    "we set @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    , same cases as fig .  1 for the pcm ( top ) and the hm ( bottom ) .",
    "inset : @xmath44 for the pcm , for @xmath76 .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ]    we now take the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mconf ] ) and compute numerically @xmath41 for the two maps .",
    "notice that the structure of the maps is @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) .",
    "the @xmath80 limit implies @xmath81\\to 1 $ ] ( i.e. no decoherence ) .",
    "the coupling strength is given by @xmath82 and @xmath79 .",
    "for weak couplings , ( in the chaotic case ) the afa decays exponentially , and the rate depends quadratically on the coupling parameter  the fermi golden rule regime ( fgr ) . here",
    "the evolution is expected to be markovian . throughout this paper",
    "we consider mainly coupling strengths beyond the fgr .",
    "the afa is evaluated directly by averaging the echo operator over a complete set of states . for the pcm we change @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pcat ] ) so we can assess the change in @xmath35 for different levels of chaoticity .",
    "for the hm varying @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : harp ] ) , we go from integrable to completely chaotic . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] ( top ) , we show the nm measure @xmath41 for three different examples of the pcm with varying degrees of chaoticity . on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] , we show the same for the hm , where we show the afa for three different @xmath83 ( regular , mixed , and chaotic ) . for the pcm after a small number of steps , there appear three distinct jumps . as expected , the larger @xmath65 is , the smaller is the jump , which confirms the intuitive relation that the more chaotic the environment is , the more markovian is the evolution . after this short time behavior , the three cases exhibit linear growth of @xmath41 .",
    "the explanation is simple .",
    "for fully chaotic systems , at a time of the order of ehrenfest time [ @xmath84 , the afa saturates  but oscillates  around @xmath60",
    "this saturation corresponds to the overlap between two completely random states , and is approximately constant .",
    "this implies that @xmath35 will grow linearly and that the slope @xmath85 will be proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on the map ( for the pcm , regardless of the value of @xmath65 , we found the slope to be @xmath86 ) . for completeness",
    ", we include the case @xmath44 in the weak coupling regime .",
    "as expected , @xmath87 visibly up to @xmath88 .",
    "after that we have linear growth . on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] , we show @xmath89 for the hm for three qualitatively different cases . in the case in which the classical dynamics is regular ( @xmath90 ) , we observe that up to the times shown @xmath41 increases non - linearly .",
    "there is a saturation of the afa , but _ not _ at @xmath60 , which eventually leads to a linear growth of @xmath35 .",
    "this saturation for small @xmath83 takes place at much larger times . when the dynamics is almost fully chaotic ( @xmath52 ) , there is a very small jump after which there remains only the linear growth due to fluctuations around the saturation value .",
    "the slope of this linear growth is @xmath91 . in the parameter region where the kam tori of the hm begin to break",
    ", there is a combination between regular and chaotic dynamics ( initial states can have components inside regular islands and components inside the chaotic sea ) and the behavior is less intuitive .",
    "in fact what is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] for @xmath92 is that the environment modeled by a hm in the transition from regular to chaotic can be strongly non - markovian [ see also fig .  [",
    "fig : mdek ] ] .    in both situations ,",
    "the long time behavior for the nm measure is linear .",
    "this would imply @xmath93 .",
    "however , this assertion presents no problems in our analysis .",
    "the slope of the long time linear regime goes to zero as @xmath42 grows .",
    "intuition suggests ` large ' environment as a necessary condition of markovianity .",
    "however , in the @xmath94 limit , there will always remain the short time value attained by @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] ) , which is independent of @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .    to shed more light on the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] we focus on the evolution of the afa as a function of time for the cases considered above . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we show examples of the decay of the square of the afa . in the top panel ,",
    "we show results for the pcm for three different values of @xmath65 ( i.e. different @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pcat ] ) ) .",
    "in the bottom panel , we show the same for the hm , with three values of @xmath83 ( regular , mixed , and chaotic ) .",
    "in contrast with the le , the afa is independent of the type if initial states and decays exponentially with two distinct decay rates .",
    "the short time decay rate @xmath95 can be related to uncorrelated  random  dynamics @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath95 can be computed using semiclassical methods .",
    "this decay rate can diverge , meaning that the short time decay can be extremely fast .",
    "these divergences  which depend on the type of perturbation , and are more evident the larger @xmath65 is  could be related to the phenomenon known as survival collapse @xcite after which the largest revivals appear . for the numerical results , on the top we chose a value of @xmath79 for the pcm which corresponds to a large @xmath95 ( near the diverging values ) , where the largest revivals have been observed @xcite .",
    "we remark , moreover , that the short time decay of the afa is independent of @xmath42 and therefore so is the revival . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we see that the afa ( for the pcm , with @xmath44 ) is almost equal for three different values of @xmath42 up to @xmath96 .",
    "this is important because the short time revivals will provide the main contribution to @xmath35 . while this contribution remains constant with @xmath42 the long time contribution goes to zero as @xmath60 .",
    "the curve with diamonds supports the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] [ top ] for the weak coupling regime .     as a function of @xmath83 , for @xmath97 , for the hm with @xmath55 and @xmath98 .",
    "top : phase space diagram for three examples of @xmath83 : regular , @xmath90 ; mixed @xmath92 ; chaotic @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding points in the bottom panel are drawn in solid black .",
    "[ fig : mdek ] ]    the possibility to assess the behavior as an environment model , by changing one parameter , from regular to chaotic , is indeed tempting . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdek ] we computed @xmath35 at a fixed time for the hm for different values of @xmath83 .",
    "we chose @xmath97 , around the time in which the fastest decaying case starts to saturate ( see fig  [ fig : dos ] , bottom ) .",
    "we see that for small @xmath83 ( regular dynamics ) , @xmath35 takes a constant value ( which , apart from the fixed time , depends on @xmath42 and @xmath82 ) and there is a transition where @xmath35 depends on @xmath83 just where the kam tori begin to break .",
    "when the dynamics is fully chaotic , the value of @xmath35 ( at @xmath97 ) again takes a constant value .",
    "[ fig : mdek ] is a clear example of the expected behavior : regular environments are expected to be more nm while the nm behavior that appears to linger in the chaotic regime is due to the same oscillatory behavior around the saturation value mentioned for the case of the pcm . in the transition region , @xmath99 , there is coexistence between tori and chaotic regions . in the first place",
    ", the existence of regular islands implies that even though there will be leaking  by tunneling  to the chaotic regions , the saturation will take much longer .",
    "in addition , the area occupied by the chaotic region is smaller than the torus , therefore , the saturation value is larger than @xmath60 .",
    "we have checked for other times ( up to @xmath100 ) and also other methods ( not shown ) ",
    "e.g. taking as nm value the @xmath101-intercept of an asymptotic linear fit  and the qualitative behavior is the same .",
    "further studies are needed in order to fully grasp the behavior in the intermediate region .",
    "we addressed the issue of how well a chaotic environment can model markovian evolution .",
    "we used a probe qubit as a system coupled to an environment modeled by a quantum map . in this",
    "setting there is a straightforward relation between some measures of nm behavior and the afa .",
    "the study of the time evolution of the nm measure has shown that the stronger the chaos of the environment ( in the pcm larger @xmath65 ) , the more markovian the evolution will be , even if the coupling is strong .",
    "furthermore , there are two well defined regimes . for short times",
    ", there is no dependence with @xmath42 and the nm is measured by revivals in the afa . in contrast , for large times , the measure grows linearly with a slope that vanishes as @xmath102 .",
    "thus , in accordance with @xcite , as @xmath94 there can be a remaining non vanishing value for non - markovianity , for a chaotic environment .",
    "the revivals of the le were recently related to nm behavior @xcite .",
    "here we make a more general approach by allowing the bath to be in a thermal state and expressing non - markovianity in terms of the afa  a quantity which is independent of the set of states over which the average is done .",
