    "the resonance lines of he  i and he  ii show unusual behaviour when compared with other strong emission lines in solar euv spectra .",
    "recent results from the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) show that their intensities in coronal holes are factors of 1.52.0 smaller than in the quiet sun ( peter 1999 ; jordan , macpherson & smith 2001 ) , while other lines formed at similar temperatures show only very small reductions in intensity . in the quiet sun , the helium resonance line intensities are at least an order of magnitude too large to be reproduced by emission measure distributions that account for other transition region ( tr ) lines ( macpherson & jordan 1999  hereafter mj99 ) . for",
    "discussions of earlier observations of the helium resonance lines and attempts to explain them see hammer and mj99 .",
    "the discrepancies between observations and modelling of the helium lines in the quiet sun have been taken to imply that some process preferentially enhances the helium resonance line intensities with respect to other lines formed in the transition region in the quiet sun , and that the enhancement is reduced in coronal holes .",
    "current evidence suggests that in the quiet sun the he  ii , and to a lesser extent the he  i , resonance lines are formed mainly by collisional excitation ( see smith & jordan 2002  hereafter paper i  for supporting references ) . because the helium resonance lines have unusually large values of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the excitation energy and @xmath2 is the electron temperature , their collisional contribution functions are sensitive to excitation by suprathermal electrons .",
    "he  i and he  ii also have long ionization times compared with other transition region species , which may allow departures from ionization equilibrium in helium .",
    "any process exposing helium ions to larger populations of suprathermal electrons than in equilibrium will tend to increase the collisional excitation rates of the helium lines , while lines with smaller @xmath0 will be relatively unaffected .",
    "mj99 reported that attempts to model such effects had been generally unsuccessful in explaining the helium resonance line emission _ relative _ to other transition region ( tr ) lines .",
    "while a conclusive explanation is still lacking , some recent work appears promising ( see paper i ) .",
    "fontenla , avrett & loeser have extended their earlier work @xcite , performing radiative transfer calculations for hydrogen and helium including the effects of mass - conserving flows as well as ambipolar diffusion and departures from ionization equilibrium .",
    "his preliminary results show improved agreement with observations , outflows ( of 510 km s@xmath3 at @xmath4 k ) producing increases in intensity in the he  i and he  ii resonance lines of up to an order of magnitude .",
    "inflow models produce self - reversals in the he  i 584.3-  line , whereas observations show the line is more likely to be self - reversed in cell interior regions ( e.g.  mj99 ) where the line shows a _ blue _",
    "shift @xcite .",
    "this implies that the models do not yet include all relevant processes .",
    "as the models do not include the effects of diffusion on any elements heavier than helium , it is also uncertain as to how successful they will be in explaining the helium line intensities _ relative _ to other transition region lines .",
    "jordan ( 1975,1980 ) suggested two possible enhancement mechanisms dependent on the magnitude of the temperature gradient that might explain the coronal hole / quiet sun contrast , munro & withbroe having found d@xmath5d@xmath6 to be an order of magnitude smaller inside coronal holes .",
    "the first involves the transport of helium ions up the steep tr temperature gradient , allowing them to be excited at electron temperatures higher than those in equilibrium .",
    "jordan ( 1980 ) found that intensity enhancements of up to a factor of 5 could be produced in the he  ii 303.8-  line in the quiet sun , and a more detailed study by andretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggests similar factors .",
    "a further investigation of the process using an improved treatment of the excitation times of the helium ions is reported in paper i. the analysis was extended to include estimates of the effects on the he  i 584.3-  and 537.0-  lines .",
    "we conclude , as did andretta et al .   for the he  ii line , that current observations are consistent with the process accounting for at least part , and perhaps all , of the enhancement apparently required in the helium resonance lines in the quiet sun .",
    "a complementary study of the other of jordan s ( 1980 ) suggestions , enhanced collisional excitation by suprathermal electrons of non - local origin , is presented in this paper .",
    "radiative transfer codes usually assume that the electron velocity distribution functions ( evdfs ) are maxwellian throughout the model atmospheres , but observations of the solar wind ( e.g.  scudder 1994 ) and numerical studies of the form of the evdf in the solar transition region suggest that significant departures from maxwellian distributions may occur .",
    "this may result from some acceleration process maintaining a non - maxwellian distribution in the low tr or chromosphere ( scudder 1992a ; vias , wong & klimas 2000 ) or from the transport of high energy electrons from the upper tr and corona @xcite . in the second case at least",
    ", the influence of the suprathermal electrons would depend on the temperature gradient .",
    "the presence of an enhanced suprathermal electron population would simulate an increase in electron temperature in transitions with excitation energies well above the local thermal energy , and hence lead to larger excitation rates .",
    "transitions with @xmath1 smaller than the energy at which the suprathermal electron population becomes important would not be affected significantly . postulated",
    "non - maxwellian evdfs generally show departures from the local maxwellian distribution which increase monotonically with energy , so that their effects on ionization rates can be even larger than on line excitation .",
    "essentially the same effect limits the effectiveness of non - thermal transport of helium at temperatures much higher than those of normal line formation . in the case of collisional ionization by",
    "non - local suprathermal electrons the effect is a shift of the ionization equilibrium ; increased collisional ionization rates raise the population of each ion at lower temperatures . emission could therefore be increased because it would occur over a larger , more dense region .    in a study of si  iii emission line ratios , pinfield et al .",
    "claim to have observed both an enhancement of the intensity of the line with the largest value of @xmath7 and a reduction in peak line formation temperature in the quiet sun with respect to a coronal hole . in light of the above discussion",
    ", this is evidence of excitation by an enhanced suprathermal population of electrons whose importance depends on the temperature gradient in the transition region .",
    "although the same mechanism has often been suggested to explain the anomalous intensities of the helium resonance lines , few detailed calculations of the possible effects on helium have been made , perhaps because of the difficulty of solving the boltzmann equation for the evdf and the equation of radiative transfer simultaneously .",
    "shoub computed non - maxwellian collision rates for the ionization of he  i and he  ii and the excitation of the 584.3-  and 303.8-  lines , but did not calculate line intensities for comparison with observations .",
    "anderson , raymond & ballegooijen computed intensities for the he  ii 303.8-line using non - maxwellian evdfs , but did not include radiative transfer , and made no study of he  i.    in this paper i present the results of radiative transfer calculations for cases of both maxwellian and non - maxwellian collisional excitation .",
    "the former illustrate the problems found in attempting to model the formation of the helium resonance lines ; the latter are used in a study of the observable effects that non - maxwellian evdfs might have on he  i and he  ii lines .",
    "the calculations allow an extensive comparison of the predictions of the enhanced excitation mechanism with observations .",
    "the atomic and atmospheric models used in the radiative transfer calculations are described in section [ sec2 ] , and the results of radiative transfer calculations performed with maxwellian collision rates are presented in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "section [ sec4 ] describes how the effects of non - local electrons are simulated .",
    "the results of these latter calculations are presented and discussed in section [ sec5 ] , and the conclusions are summarized in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the radiative transfer modelling of the solar helium spectrum was carried out using version 2.2 of the multi code @xcite .",
    "this code may be used to solve non - lte problems in semi - infinite plane - parallel one dimensional model atmospheres . in order to calculate an emergent spectrum ,",
    "the code requires a model atom , a model atmosphere , and a set of abundances ( which are used to calculate background opacities - these are generally computed assuming lte , but in the calculations reported here , the opacity due to hydrogen was computed in non - lte ) .",
    "it also allows the specification of the coronal radiation field as a boundary condition at the upper edge of the model atmosphere .",
    "the atomic model used in this study comprises 29 bound levels of he  i ( @xmath8 terms with principal quantum number @xmath9 ) , six bound levels of he  ii with @xmath10 , and the he  iii ground state .",
    "the atomic data used before modifications were made to incorporate collisional excitation and ionization by non - maxwellian evdfs are listed below .",
    "the he  i part of the model was initially based on the 30 level he  i model of andretta & jones , but using newer and/or more complete data for some of the parameters , and was extended to include he  ii .",
    "greater detail was included in the neutral stage , in order to facilitate investigation of the relationships between the 584.3-  and 537.0-  lines , which have been observed extensively with _",
    "soho_. previous work by hearn and andretta & jones ( 1997 ) suggested that the formation of these lines depends on a combination of collisional and radiative transitions between many levels , and is not necessarily dominated by either direct collisional excitation or photoionization - recombination ( pr ) .",
    "it was therefore important to include as many levels and processes as possible in this part of the model . in he  ii most attention",
    "was paid to the 303.8-  resonance line , which also appears in _ soho _ cds spectra .",
    "the energies of the he  i levels are taken from martin , averaging over the fine structure in the triplet levels .",
    "the fine structure in the triplet terms is not included , which is a valid approximation in the rate equations since the energy separation of the sub - levels is small enough for collisional transitions between them to keep their populations in the proportions of their statistical weights . as noted by andretta & jones ( 1997 ) ,",
    "although this assumption may not be valid in the @xmath11  @xmath12 term , where the separation of the @xmath13-states is greatest , radiative transitions will also tend to populate the sub - levels in the same proportions in the conditions encountered in the atmospheric models used .",
    "the energies of the he  ii levels are from kisielius , berrington & norrington for @xmath14 , from bashkin & stoner for @xmath15 .",
    "states of different @xmath16 were summed over according to their statistical weights .",
    "oscillator strengths for most of the allowed transitions in he  i are provided by drake , while values for the few transitions not covered there are taken from theodosiou .",

    "@xmath19  @xmath20 transition is taken from drake & dalgarno , and the two photon rate for the @xmath21  @xmath20 ",
    "@xmath19  @xmath20 transition is also included , from bassani & vignale .",
    "the he  ii oscillator strengths are taken to be hydrogenic , using the results of wiese , smith & glennon .",
    "stark broadening parameters for he  i are from dimitrijevi & sahal - brchot ( 1984,1990 ) where available , with the remainder being estimated using the formula of freudenstein & cooper ( 1978 ) .",
    "the stark widths of griem are used for he  ii .",
    "van der waals broadening is treated using the tables of deridder & van rensbergen , taking advantage of alterations made to multi by rowe .",
    "for most of the levels of he  i photoionization cross - sections are drawn from the opacity project database @xcite ; they were calculated by fernley , taylor & seaton .",
    "the broadest , most prominent resonances in the cross - sections are represented approximately in the model , particularly in the resonance continuum , as there is some variation of the coronal radiation field in the wavelength range of the resonances .",
    "the 4  @xmath22 , 4  @xmath23 , 5  @xmath22 , 5  @xmath23 , and 5  @xmath24 levels of he  i are treated as hydrogenic , as are the photoionization cross - sections for he  ii @xcite .",
    "photoionization is important in establishing the ionization balance between all three stages of helium and is important in the formation of some of its lines .",
    "the effects of coronal radiation shortwards of 504   are therefore included in the calculation of ionization and recombination rates .",
    "the coronal illumination was represented using the solar euv irradiance model of tobiska ( 1991,1993 ) .",
    "the spectrum of radiation at minimum coronal activity was used to give incoming intensities at the solar surface representative of the average quiet corona .",
    "photoionization of he  i occurs directly from the ground state , by coronal radiation , and by a two - stage process , in which he  i triplet states , collisionally excited from the ground , are rapidly photoionized ( directly or by successive photoexcitations followed by ionization ) by the photospheric radiation field . the importance of this two - stage process was recognized in early calculations by athay & johnson and hearn , and by andretta & jones , who emphasized how the singlet and triplet systems of he  i have quite different roles in the ionization balance .",
    "collisional excitation of singlet levels tends to lead more often to decays back to the ground , to which the singlet levels are strongly connected by the allowed radiative transitions",
    "@xmath25  @xmath26 ",
    "@xmath19  @xmath20 . in the triplet system , the metastable 2 @xmath27 level acts like a ground state , and recombinations to higher triplet levels tend not to lead to cascade decays , but more often result in re - ionization by the photospheric radiation field .",
    "recombinations to singlet states generally result in radiative cascades to the ground .",
    "collisonal excitation rates between bound levels of he  i are calculated , where possible , using the collision strengths of lanzafame et al .",
    ", as these are valid over a large temperature range .",
    "collision rates in the resonance series are among those calculated using these data .",
    "collision strengths for most of the remaining transitions in he  i are provided by sawey & berrington , and gaps are filled using data from mihalas & stone and benson & kulander .",
    "some of these early data are expected only to be correct to an order of magnitude .",
    "collision strengths for bound  bound transitions in he  ii are drawn from aggarwal et al .",
    "for @xmath28 and from aggarwal , berrington & pathak for transitions involving @xmath29 .",
    "the remaining he  ii collision strengths are calculated using the expression given by mihalas & stone ( 1968 ) .",
    "collisional ionization rates from all levels of he  i and he  ii are calculated using expressions from mihalas & stone ( 1968 ) .",
    "older data have been used in preference to newer information because the more recent work is not general enough .",
    "bray et al .",
    ", for example , give the ionization cross - section for only the ground state of he  ii ; the equivalent cross - section provided by mihalas & stone ( 1968 ) is in fact very similar , but they also give expressions for ionization from excited states .",
    "dielectronic recombination to he  i , for both maxwellian and non - maxwellian electron distributions , was investigated in detail ( smith 2000 ) , but was found to have very little effect on the formation of the 584.3-  and 537.0-  lines .",
    "since the detailed physical processes responsible for heating the chromosphere , transition region , and corona remain unknown , most of the atmospheric models suitable for use in radiative transfer calculations are semi - empirical .",
    "their temperature structures are chosen to reproduce observations of spectral lines and continua , rather than being derived from the energy balance _",
    "ab initio_. the val model atmospheres ( vernazza , avrett & loeser 1981 , hereafter val ) , are successful in many respects and are the most often used solar models of this type .",
    "the models were constructed to fit six brightness components ( a  f ) observed by the harvard instruments on skylab .",
    "the c component represents the average quiet sun , and the val c model was initially adopted in the present work . the val d model , representing the average quiet sun network , was also tested against observations .",
    "the run of temperature against column mass density in both models is shown in figure [ fig:2e ] .",
    "= 3.7 in    fontenla et al .   modified the val model atmospheres in an effort to improve the physical basis of the models .",
    "these new ( fal ) models have semi - empirical chromospheric structure based on the val models , but have transition regions derived from energy balance considerations including the the effects of ambipolar diffusion of h and he .",
    "these models produce results consistent with observations of the hydrogen lines without need for the plateau at about @xmath30 k in the val models ( see figure [ fig:2e ] ) , but do not reproduce observed helium resonance line intensities well .",
    "the fal models neglect the effects of turbulence ( except in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ) , and it is not clear to what extent the steady state diffusion flows in the models are present in the dynamic solar atmosphere .",
    "the models also do not include the effects of diffusion on any elements heavier than helium , lines of which must be compared with the helium lines in any explanation of the formation of the latter .",
    "these factors suggest that the representation of the transition region in the fal models is not necessarily superior to that in the semi - empirical val models . for these reasons ,",
    "the val models were used in preference to fal in the present work .",
    "there are some problems with the val models .",
    "calculations using the val c and d model atmospheres produce intensities in the c  ii lines around 1335   about a factor of six larger than the values observed by mj99 @xcite .",
    "this appears to be due to the influence of the ` lyman @xmath31 plateau ' in the val models at about @xmath32 k , which was included in order to put enough material in the appropriate temperature range to reproduce the observed intensities of lines of h and he , particularly the very important h ly@xmath31 line .",
    "the plateau produces a local peak in the emd in the temperature range of the formation of both the he  i resonance series and the c  ii lines .",
    "mj99 found that this peak also causes si  iii line intensities to be over - produced by a factor of at least 2 with respect to their observations . in view of this problem with the val models , and in order to make comparisons with mj99 more meaningful , new model atmospheres were constructed to be consistent with emission measures derived from observed intensities of tr lines of elements other than helium .",
    "the new models were chosen to represent the network rather than cell interior regions .",
    "models of the magnetic field generally show flux tubes confined to the network boundaries at photospheric levels expanding in the chromosphere and tr to fill the atmosphere in the corona ( see e.g.  gabriel 1976 ) .",
    "such models suggest that network regions may be more reasonably modelled with radial magnetic fields than cell interiors .",
    "the effects of non - local electrons would be expected to be greatest where the magnetic field extends directly into the corona .",
    "also , the val chromospheric model may not be valid in cell interiors , as the time - dependent models of carlsson & stein suggest that a classical chromosphere with an outward - increasing temperature may not exist in non - magnetic internetwork regions .",
    "the multi code requires , as input for a ( static ) model atmosphere , the run of mass column density , temperature , electron density , and microturbulent velocity .",
    "below @xmath33 k these figures were taken directly from the val d network model .",
    "the transition region and coronal parts of the models were developed from emission measure distributions using methods described by philippides and mcmurry .",
    "the emds used to derive these parts of the new models are described in detail in paper i and only brief details are repeated here . in the upper tr ( above log  @xmath2 = 5.3 ) , the emds were derived assuming energy balance between radiation losses and the divergence of the classical conductive flux from the corona .",
    "the coronal emission measures were chosen to fit the emd to mj99 s observations of mg  ix and mg  x. as discussed in paper i , this requires pressures higher than were observed by mj99 in the network , but similar to those in the val models . below log  @xmath2 = 5.3 , the lower transition region of model",
    "s was derived directly from mj99 s network emd .",
    "as explained in paper i , the form of the emd is uncertain , as the cds and sumer lines could not be observed at the same locations at the same time .",
    "a second model was therefore constructed .",
    "model x was made using the emd derived from hst observations of the g8  v star @xmath34 boo a , scaled to the minimum of the mj99 network emd ( see paper i ) .",
    "the lower transition region parts of the two models were derived assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( including a contribution to the pressure from turbulent motions ) using methods discussed by jordan & brown and more recently by harper .",
    "the resulting transition region models were grafted separately on to the val d model chromosphere .",
    "running multi in hydrostatic equilibrium with a 9 level hydrogen atom produced new values of @xmath35 and of the height at the base of the transition region , which were used to improve the transition region parts of the models .",
    "self - consistent models were found by iterating this process to convergence in @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting models are shown in figure [ fig:3h ] , which shows how the temperature plateau in the val d model is suppressed in the new network models .",
    "the full models used in the calculations are given in an appendix in tables [ taba7 ] and [ taba8 ] .",
    "= 3.7 in    the elemental abundances used in the calculations were the photospheric abundances of grevesse , noels & sauval and anders & grevesse .",
    "the helium abundance is taken as @xmath37 and is assumed to be constant through the atmosphere .",
    "calculations by hansteen , leer & holzer predict that the helium abundance could vary significantly in the solar atmosphere .",
    "their models show a _ decreased _ helium abundance in the transition region , and so can not explain the apparent enhancement of the helium line intensities .",
    "in this section the results of calculations assuming purely maxwellian electron distributions are discussed , and compared with the observations of mj99 .",
    "calculations were performed both with and without the quiet coronal illumination described in section [ sec2 ] in order to investigate the importance of photoionization - recombination ( pr ) in the formation of the helium resonance lines .",
    "the discussion focusses on the he  ii resonance line at 303.8   and the first two lines of the he  i resonance series , at 584.3   and 537.0  .",
    "the he  i triplet lines ( e.g.  10830  ) are not discussed here ; they were discussed in detail by andretta & jones ( 1997 ) , and nothing has been found that contradicts their analysis ."
