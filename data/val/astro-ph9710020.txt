    "table [ tab : data ] summarizes the known parameters for the companions of six nearby quasars .",
    "the first three columns give quasar s name , its redshift and absolute magnitude .",

    "the last column is the covering factor @xmath11 , discussed in  [ sec : lines ] .",
    "the physical conditions in the interstellar medium of the companions are different from the galaxy .",
    "powerful ultraviolet radiation from the qso , if isotropic , is able to ionize a large fraction of the gas . for a distant observer",
    ", the companion galaxies would look like giant hii regions .",
    "therefore , spectroscopic observations of the companion galaxies of quasars directly test anisotropy of the quasar ionizing radiation suggested by the implied agn model ( cf .",
    "for example @xcite ) .",
    "the results of such observations may be important in understanding the quasar environment .",
    "@xcite observed extended line emission around a sample of quasars in their narrow - band [ ]  @xmath05007  survey . in many cases ,",
    "the emission regions are not confined to the nearest detected companion and instead show asymmetric structures , such as bridges and tidal tails .",
    "the stockton - mackenty results suggest that at least in some cases companion galaxies are experiencing violent interactions with the qsos and that their gas may have been removed by interstellar shocks .",
    "however , very little observational evidence exists on the emission - line spectra of the close companions .",
    "our work is intended to motivate future observations by showing that gas content and metallicity can be assessed by obtaining spectra of the companions .",
    "we calculate the emission line spectrum expected from a single gas cloud with various galactic parameters , which is illuminated by the hard uv radiation from a central qso source . comparing our models with the results of narrow band imaging or high - resolution spectroscopy yields estimates of the gas density and its distribution .",
    "we outline in  [ sec : lines ] the calculations and the method that can be used to study the ism in the companion galaxies .",
    "next , we discuss in  [ sec : results ] the results for individual companions . finally , in  [",
    "sec : discussion ] , we speculate on what can be learned about quasars and their environment from the study of emission lines of the companion galaxies .",
    "we use the photoionization program cloudy , version 84.12 ( @xcite ) to calculate the emission line spectrum of a cloud of gas exposed under the quasar radiation .",
    "the density of the gas , @xmath12 , is assumed constant throughout the cloud .",
    "the shape of the incident qso s spectrum is from @xcite and is normalized to the total quasar luminosity , @xmath13 .",
    "the underlying continuum of the companion is assumed to be the standard spectrum of a sbc galaxy , as reported by @xcite , normalized to @xmath14 .",
    "we explore five orders of magnitude in the gas density ( values characteristic of a normal galaxy ) , and four orders of magnitude in the ionizing flux .",
    "the equivalent widths of the emission lines are evaluated relative to the outgoing continuum of the companion galaxy that includes the component of the incident radiation absorbed and re - radiated by the gas . for a similar exploration of clouds within , not outside ,",
    "the agn see @xcite .",
    "the gas in the cloud will be partially ( or fully ) ionized by the quasar radiation and will resemble a giant hii region .",
    "the principle differences from galactic hii regions are the geometry of the cloud and the shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "the companion galaxy usually occupies a small solid angle as seen from the quasar , and therefore only a fraction of the ionizing flux will hit the inner surface of the cloud .",
    "this fraction is characterized by the _ covering factor _",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the solid angle subtended by the cloud , @xmath17 is the surface of the cloud closest to the quasar , and @xmath10 is the distance to the quasar .    unlike a galactic hii region ,",
    "the ionization region around the quasar does not have a definite boundary because of the power - law spectrum of the ionizing radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the electron density declines smoothly with radius and it is not possible to separate completely the ionized and neutral zones .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to introduce a parameter analogous to the strmgren  radius of the hii region .",
    "since cloudy imposes spherical geometry on the cloud , the ionized region is a spherical shell with surface area @xmath17 and mean radial width @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 s@xmath4 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electron and proton densities , respectively . a filling factor , @xmath24 , accounts for the non - uniform distribution of the gas in the cloud .",
    "@xmath25 is the total rate of ionizing photons from the quasar . for the chosen shape of the quasar continuum , @xmath26 the `` strmgren  width '' , @xmath18 ,",
    "provides a useful estimate of the effective volume occupied by the ionized gas that determines the line emission strength from the cloud .",
    "table [ tab : ion ] gives the values of @xmath18 for our sample .",
    "only two close companions have ionization zones comparable to their size , and in the rest of the galaxies the strmgren  zone is ionization limited ( its size @xmath27 ) .",
    "the actual widths of the companions ( column 4 ) , as well as their covering factors , were estimated from the _ hst _ images .    in the cloudy calculations we use solar abundances of elements .",
    "our choice is supported by the recent result that the abundances of the heavy elements considered here ( o , n , ne , and mg ) differ by less than 50% in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite ) , and by the current models of chemical evolution of galaxies ( for example , @xcite ) that predict slow evolution of metallicity over the last @xmath28 gyr .",
    "external galaxies , however , show a spread of metallicities .",
    "while including abundances as free parameters would significantly complicate our models , it is still necessary to investigate the extent to which varying metallicity of the gas may change the predicted spectrum .",
    "interstellar dust can also modify the thermal balance in the clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have conducted test calculations including the depletion of certain elements onto dust grains ( as described in @xcite ) and varying metallicity parameter in a wide range of @xmath29 .",
    "at very low metallicity ( @xmath30 ) , the forbidden line emission ( for example , [ ] ) increases as @xmath31 rises , while the hydrogen balmer line intensity is essentially constant . increasing metal abundance leads to more efficient cooling and correspondingly lower electron temperature . at about solar metallicity",
    "the temperature effect starts to dominate and both [ ]  and  decline even as @xmath31 increases ( @xcite ) .",
    "including dust grains in the calculations gives rise to the opposite phenomenon .",
    "the main effect of the grains is depletion of metals from the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "this reduces cooling efficiency of the gas and leads to higher temperature than in the dust - free case .",
    "therefore the variation of the predicted emission lines with @xmath31 is reduced .",
    "the test calculations have been performed for all quasar companions considered in  [ sec : results ] . in the range @xmath32 , the intensity of the [ ]  line varied by an average of 45% for the two close companions and by 53% for the other companions with lower ionization level . in the range @xmath33 for the close companions , [ ]",
    "was reduced by about 90% compared to its value at @xmath34 .",
    "the [ ] /  line ratio changes more slowly than the [ ]  intensity at high metallicity because of similar drop in . in all calculations involving the two close companions the average electron temperature was in the range @xmath35 k , and for the low - ionization companions",
    "@xmath36 k. from these tests we conclude that choosing solar abundances maximizes the forbidden line emission from the quasar companions .      when companions are very compact or very close to the quasar , such that @xmath37 , essentially all gas is ionized and the intensity of the emission lines is directly proportional to the effective volume occupied by the gas , @xmath38 .",

    "note that [ ]  @xmath47 line is also present if [ ]  @xmath05007is observed .",

    "given good data from several lines ( including upper limits ) , it seems possible to construct a model with a realistic gas distribution covering a range of densities @xmath12 .",
    "if the companions are sufficiently far from the quasar , the strength of the emission lines is limited by the number of ionizations . at high enough density , the effective volume of the ionized region is @xmath51 and the equivalent widths of the hydrogen lines are proportional to a single ionization parameter @xmath52 this parameter is , in principle , directly observable .",

    "the dominant excitation mechanism is collisions with electrons unless the radiation field is so strong that recombination to excited levels becomes important .",
    "for the [ ]  line , collisional excitation prevails if @xmath60 , which is always satisfied in our models .",

    "is so high that the ion abundances of the heavy elements are controlled by recombination from the next ionization state . as a result ,",

    "figure [ fig : map_i ] allows us to find the best ionization model describing a set of the observed emission lines .",
    "the ionization parameter of the cloud could be determined directly from the observations ( see eq . [ [ eq : a ] ] ) .",
    "ideally the contours of the equivalent widths should all intersect in one point with the horizontal line of the known , and even one measured line would suffice to obtain the value of the gas density .",
    "however given the uncertainty of measurements , it is desirable to have several lines in order to better constrain the estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "how does the observational uncertainty in  propagate to the inferred values of @xmath12 ?",
    "we have considered a range of values of  and obtained the corresponding range of allowed densities .",

    "in this section , we apply the results of our calculations to the individual companions listed in table [ tab : data ] . in calculation of luminosities of quasars and their companions",
    "we use a solar v magnitude of @xmath68 ( @xcite ) and the hubble constant 0 .",
    "note that choice of @xmath69 does not affect the predicted equivalent widths because the ionizing fluxes from the quasars are invariant to distance scaling .    to account for the third spatial dimension , we correct the projected separations of the companions from the quasars by a factor of @xmath70 . these larger values are used in calculation of the ionization models .",

    "its compact nature is best revealed on the _ hst _ image ( bkss ) , where the companion is unambiguously distinguished from the nebulosity surrounding the quasar .",
    "based on the spectrum of the companion , @xcite showed that it is actually a foreground star .",
    "therefore , the narrow line emission is produced by the gas in the fuzzy nebulosity extending over more than @xmath71 kpc .",

    "one striking feature of the plot is that all three contours run reasonably close along the line corresponding to the constant strmgren  radius ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "therefore any model along the line is , in principle , capable of reproducing the observed emission .",
    "however , the isocontours never cross in one point , suggesting that more than one constant density model is required for the adequate fit of observations , provided the estimated equivalent widths are correct .",
    "we considered a simple combination of high and low density clouds ( see table [ tab : closecomp ] ) .",
    "the high density clouds are needed to reproduce the [ ]  emission , since most of the oxygen is doubly ionized at small densities ( @xmath74 @xmath41 ) at the apparently small observed separation from the quasar .",
    "the low density clouds are likely to be present in the large extended nebulosity .",
    "we stress that the choice of high and low density clouds is not uniquely set by the available data .",

    "however it is barely detectable in the spectrum , and the estimated upper limit on its equivalent width is about 3  .",
    "thus the gas density of the model @xmath76 is limited to @xmath77 @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger filling factor ( @xmath78 ) leads to a significant overestimate of the  line while still not producing enough of the [ ] .",
    "another companion is located 6  to the east from pks 2135 - 14 .",
    "@xcite confirmed that it is a galaxy at the redshift of the quasar , however its spectrum does not show strong emission lines .",
    "the closest companion of pks 2349 - 014 exhibits a tidal interaction with the host qso ( see bahcall et al .",
    "its redshift has been confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the estimated three - dimensional distance from the quasar is 4.2@xmath9  kpc .",
    "there are also apparent tidal tails and a large nebulosity surrounding , but offset from , the quasar .",
    "if the quasar has a host galaxy similar to the milky way , the companion would inspiral due to dynamical friction in @xmath79 yr .",
    "we have computed two illustrative models with plausible gas densities of @xmath80 @xmath41 and 4 @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we expect that the highly ionized , and therefore heated , gas would tend to be evenly distributed over the volume of the companion . because of the faint continuum of the companion , the predicted equivalent widths in the second model are very large ( see table [ tab : closecomp ] ) .",

    "spectroscopic observations of the companion galaxy are necessary to constrain the ionization model and to estimate the present amount of gas .    because of the extreme proximity of the companion , radiation pressure from the quasar may affect the distribution of the gas .",
    "we use cloudy calculations to estimate the radiative acceleration on a hydrogen atom in the companion .",
    "we assume an isothermal distribution of mass of the companion and adopt the mass - to - light ratio of @xmath81 characteristic of moderately young stellar population .",
    "we find that for the models i and ii , gravity of the companion dominates the radiation pressure out to 18 kpc and 8 kpc , respectively , much farther than the actual extent of this object . therefore , the gas clouds are not driven out of the companion .",
    "we have checked that the momentum transfer due to absorption of ionizing radiation by hydrogen atoms ( for example , @xcite ) is at least an order of magnitude weaker than the force due to resonant ly@xmath82 scattering .",
    "nab 0205 + 02 from the survey by @xcite has a mysterious companion at a projected separation of 22@xmath9  kpc ; this companion is very compact but is bright in the [ ]  line . @xcite",
    "estimated the equivalent width of [ ]  line of at least 400 @xmath83 from the narrow line image .",
    "on the other hand , the object was not detected at all on their line - free continuum image .",
    "recent _ hst _",
    "f606w broad band observation of the companion ( bkss ) , which includes the [ ]  line , shows that the image consists of two tiny clumps connected to each other by a bridge .",
    "there is no evidence on the _ hst _ image that the quasar host extends all the way to the companion , suggesting that the gas in the object is not affected by direct interaction with the host .",
    "the line emission in the companion may , in principle , be caused by photoionization or collisional excitation by sources internal to the companion .",
    "we assume here that it is not the case and discuss instead the situation when photoionization by the quasar is the dominant source of energy for the emission lines .    the strmgren  radius for the companion ( see table [ tab : ion ] ) is less than the apparent extent of the object ( @xmath8 3.5 kpc in ns direction , and 0.5 kpc in sw direction ) ,",
    "so that the gas will be only partially ionized for @xmath84 @xmath41 .",
    "the amount of [ ]  emission is therefore determined by the ionization parameter , which in turn depends on the covering factor . assuming that the size of the object along the line - of - sight is the same as in the ns direction , we get an upper limit on  of @xmath85 , or @xmath86 . using the estimated three - dimensional separation from the quasar of 26.5 kpc",

    "can the emitting gas be distributed more broadly than the _ hst _ image shows ?",
    "apparently , the narrow - line image of stockton & mackenty ( 1987 ; their figure 2e ) is large but this could be the effect of lower resolution relative to _ hst _ .",
    "nonetheless , we present the ionization model with @xmath87 that best fits the observations . if the model is confirmed by new spectroscopic data , a better understanding of the distribution of gas and stars in the companion will be required .",
    "if not , a much more elaborate ionization model will be needed to describe this unusual object .",

    "the faint continuum of the companion suggests the possibility that most of the light might be produced by thermal bremsstrahlung rather than starlight .",
    "the bremsstrahlung luminosity of the companion would be ( @xcite ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the free - free gaunt factor , @xmath92 is the density of ions of charge @xmath31 , and @xmath93 kpc@xmath94 ( for @xmath87 ) is the volume of the gas .",
    "the observed companion luminosity is @xmath95 ( bkss ) , and therefore one needs a density of @xmath96 @xmath41 to produce the right amount of emission .",
    "this in turn requires a larger covering factor of @xmath97 in order to match the observed ( [ ] ) with the gas density larger than 3 @xmath41 .",
    "as noted before , the covering factor can hardly be larger than @xmath98 .",
    "also , self - gravity of the gas will not be strong enough to resist the radiation pressure force , as indicated by the cloudy calculations .",

    "( 1995a ) and by fukugita & turner ( 1996 ) .    the degree of anisotropy of the quasar ionizing radiation , which is important for understanding the unified agn model ( e.g. @xcite ) , can be tested directly .",
    "if the continuum emission from the quasar is concentrated in narrow beams , the small solid angle of the companion galaxies makes them unlikely to be ionized .",
    "the companion of nab 0205 + 02 presents a particularly strong test .",
    "its tiny covering factor ( @xmath114 ) guarantees that the companion will not be ionized unless the quasar radiation is isotropic .",
    "spectroscopy of that object can determine if the line emission is consistent with photoionization by the quasar .",
    "the gas in the host galaxy itself should be strongly ionized by the quasar and all of the emission lines considered in this paper are expected to be observable . for the simplest model of a disk galaxy with the constant gas density ,",
    "the effective radius of the ionization zone is @xmath115 kpc , where @xmath116 . as noted by @xcite and @xcite , total depletion of gas and dust",
    "occurs in the inner few kiloparsecs .",
    "thermal expansion of the gas in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane leads to an amorphous envelope of hot gas around the quasar extending up to several tens of kpc .",
    "@xcite found such large emission envelopes to be ubiquitous around quasars .",
    "therefore the period of quasar activity should be longer than the timescale for thermal expansion and subsequent cooling of the gas , or @xmath117 years .",
    "close companions to three other quasars , pks 1302 - 102 , 3c 323.1 ( = q1545 + 210 ) and pg 1202 + 281 , have been detected with _",
    "hst _ ( @xcite ) but no spectra are currently available . @xcite found an extremely strong [ ]  emission around q1545 + 210 , but they could not unambiguously associate the emission with the companion 7 kpc away from the quasar .",
    "we would like to attract reader s attention to the 6 companions discussed in this paper and the other 3 objects mentioned above .",
    "they present a new interesting opportunity to understand quasars",
    ".    this project would not be possible without support and encouragement from professor john bahcall .",
