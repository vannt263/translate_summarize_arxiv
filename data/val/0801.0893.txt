    "the first object in messier s catalog of nebulous sources , the crab nebula ( m1 ) , is a young galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) and one of the most well known astronomical objects .",
    "it possesses a variety of remarkable properties and structures including : a highly complex structure of optically bright filaments as seen in recent high - resolution hubble space telescope images @xcite , an unusually luminous central pulsar ( see harden & seward 1984 and rots et al . 2004 and references therein ) with accompanying x - ray jets",
    "@xcite , and a radio and optically bright synchrotron nebula which exhibits fine - scale structural changes on timescales of just days or weeks @xcite .    the crab nebula is generally considered the archetype of a pulsar driven synchrotron wind nebula ( pwn ) and of the so - called `` plerionic '' remnants in general ( see review by @xcite ) . the spinning magnetic field of the pulsar and strong relativistic wind of particles off the neutron star have measurably accelerated the remnant s optical filaments such that their velocities , when projected back , give a date of @xmath21130 c.e .",
    "this date is @xmath280 years more recent than the 1054 c.e .",
    "date , the year a  guest star \" associated with the crab supernova is reported to have been observed by the chinese and other cultures in several ancient astronomical texts @xcite .",
    "this apparent filament acceleration , confirmed by several independent proper motion studies ( see table 1 ) , due to an outward pressure contained within the remnant s rapidly expanding pwn is described in detail by @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure 5 , we show the projected motions of all 35 northern jet knots for an expansion date of 1055 c.e . , both for our measured knot proper motion paths ( right hand figure ) , and then assuming the motions of the knots were completely radial , tracing perfectly away from the center of expansion as defined by @xcite ( left hand figure ) .",
    "overall , the observed motions of knots within the jet region suggest a nearly radial expansion and trace back to a location very close to the remnant s nominal center of expansion .",
    "our estimated positional measurement errors could have resulted in up to a 3@xmath3 change in direction which would account for a substantial fraction of the apparent non - radial motions seen in the right hand figure .",
    "thus , despite the jet s strongly overall non - radial appearance with its long axis mis - aligned with the remnant s center , individual jet knots and filaments appear to move in a radial fashion away from the remnant s estimated explosion center .",
    "two additional things should be noted from figure 5 .",
    "the first is that a substantial number of jet knots appear to cross at a position north of the center of expansion .",
    "secondly , knots located along the jet s western limb tend to show a convergence point east of the center of expansion , while knots along the jet s eastern side appear to favor a convergence point west of the center of expansion .",
    "both these effects might indicate a small , non - radial component to the jet s expansion which will be addressed below .     in radius centered on the center of expansion.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "our computed convergence date for the jet is 1055 @xmath4 c.e . , in excellent agreement with historical records which indicate the crab sn occurred in the year 1054 .",
    "we attribute the reason for the difference between our result and earlier age estimates to be chiefly the jet s northernmost knots experiencing little appreciable acceleration by the pulsar s rapidly expanding synchrotron nebula .",
    "all previous age estimates based upon proper motion studies used knots and filaments located within the main body of the crab remnant . consequently , interior knot motions reflected both an expansion due to the sn event itself and a post - sn acceleration resulting from the interaction of the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "although the 1054 explosion date for the crab nebula s sn has not been in serious doubt , it is nonetheless valuable to have a direct confirmation based on expansion dynamics .",
    "although the jet s knots and filaments appear not to have been significantly accelerated radially away from the remnant s central region , our measured jet knot proper motions may indicate a small , non - radial component . as shown in figure 5 ( right hand panel ) , the projected motions of the knots intersect north of the position of the center of expansion .",
    "this effect may not represent the actual nature of the jet as there are several sources of error which could contribute to this motion .",
    "first , it is possible that there may be a slight rotational shift between the two world coordinate system fits for the images .",
    "because the original motions of the jet ejecta were so close to directly northward , a slight shift east or west would cause a much more noticeable change in the e - w component of their proper motion than would a similarly sized shift in the n - s direction .",
    "thus , the directions of the knots would be greatly affected by such a shift , while the velocities would show considerably less error .",
    "secondly , an error in centroiding the knots can account for a slight shift as well .",
    "our computed errors show a change in direction of approximately 3@xmath3 is possible which could account for the non - radial motions of the knots .    on the other hand , it is possible that the measured motions do reflect the jet s true expansion properties .",
    "the jet is essentially a hollow structure and as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the jet does contain some faint synchrotron emission , most visible at its southern base .",
    "if this plasma induced an acceleration that was largely against the jet s filamentary walls , this might act to expand the jet in the east - west plane and explain why the northwestern jet knots end up east of the center of expansion while most knots located at the northeastern portion of the jet project back west of the center of expansion . since our derived expansion date for the jet is most sensitive to north - south motions , such an acceleration would not significantly effect our estimated dynamical age .",
    "our proper motion measurements provide a valuable constraint on the origin of the crab s northern jet of ejecta .",
    "a successful jet formation model should explain the jet s non - radial appearance , its peak expansion velocity , specific location along the remnant s outer periphery , and the lack of any obvious counter - jet to the south .",
    "below , we briefly review some of the proposed theories for the jet s origin and discuss them in relation to our dynamical measurement results .",
    "several authors have suggested the jet is a post - sn feature resulting from an interaction between the ejecta and the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "many variations of plasma instability models have been suggested including : 1 ) an aneurysm of ejecta pushed aside by the pulsar s plasma flow @xcite , 2 ) rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite or differential acceleration @xcite , 3 ) pressure from swept - up magnetic field lines @xcite , 4 ) ejecta entrainment in magnetic fields formed by highly - ordered outflows from the polar caps of the pulsar itself @xcite , and 5 ) synchrotron driven shocks @xcite .",
    "a particularly attractive feature of such models is their ability to explain both the non - radial appearance of the jet and the lack of a counter - jet to the south .",
    "however , our proper motion measurements indicate an essentially radial expanding jet . moreover ,",
    "some of these plasma instability models call for greater acceleration of the jet s filaments than those found in the main body of the nebula @xcite , or a younger age compared to the rest of the nebula @xcite .",
    "* while a greater degree of acceleration or a younger age for the jet is not supported by our data which suggests a current jet age around 950 yr similar to the crab s historic age , a more modest expansion breakout acceleration is not completely ruled out by our proper motion measurements . *    * for most plasma instability ( ` blowout ' ) models , the exact location of a high - velocity `` jet '' along the remnant s outer boundary is undefined but with a greater likelihood along the pulsar s nw  se wind injection axis .",
    "* however , the remnant s filamentary jet is some 45 degrees away from the pulsar s synchrotron jets , which lie along a nw  se axis ( pa = 300 deg ; @xcite ) . along this",
    "nw  se axis , the pwn appears to have pushed aside the remnant s outer ejecta filaments creating a virtual hole in the filamentary ejecta along the nw limb @xcite . there",
    "the synchrotron emission can be seen to leak out of the remnant s thick thermal plasma shell in optical , x - rays , and radio images of the remnant .",
    "the lack of extened filamentary line emission ejecta in this region similar to the northern ` jet ' is suggestive that the northern jet was not the result of a breakout of the pulsar s synchrotron wind nebula .      * despite a lack of an obvious southern counter - jet , the remnant s northern jet might represent high - velocity ejecta resulting from a north - south bipolar expansion asymmetry . * in 1989 , macalpine et al",
    ". showed that n - s oriented spectral drift scans of the crab revealed a nearly n - s bipolar structure .",
    "the data showed that the pinched waist of the hourglass - like expansion coincided with a band of helium rich filaments ( a `` high - helium band '' ) in which the computed helium mass fraction was at least 75% @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a helium rich circumstellar torus or disk could have resulted in constrained velocities in the horizontal region around the progenitor .",
    "subsequent drift scans of the remnant by @xcite and @xcite confirmed the presence of a strong bipolar expansion .",
    "additional support for a circumstellar torus was presented by @xcite and @xcite who examined the east and west indentations seen in the synchrotron emission ( the synchrotron bays ) and suggested these may have be caused by an e - w magnetic torus associated with the e - w band of he - rich filaments .",
    "such a magnetic torus might constrain the east - west expansion of the pwn , leaving the bay indentations seen today .    in an asymmetrical explosion model for the jet ,",
    "its location along the northern edge of the remnant is not accidental @xcite .",
    "the alignment of the jet with the northern extent of the north expansion bubble seen in spectral drift scans of the remnant plus its major axis aligned nearly perpendicular to the synchrotron bays suggest a causal link between the jet and a possible constrained e - w expansion of the sn ejecta . the lack of an equally obvious southern ` counter - jet ' might be explained by either a weaker ejection of material to the south and/or increased ejecta confinement , and indeed drift scans of the remnant do show higher velocities to the north compared to the south , relative to the pinched central zone @xcite .",
    "the jet s filaments , being farther from the pulsar s energetic wind , would experience less acceleration compared to knots and filaments located in the main body of the nebula .",
    "our measurements of other locations at the base of the jet and to the east and west appear consistent with this picture , showing * larger * dynamical ages correlating with their increased distance from the pulsar ( see table 3 ) .",
    "finally , we note that our computed expansion age of the jet , although yielding an expansion age consistent with the historic sn sighting in the year 1054 , could also be viewed consistent with * an initial * acceleration by the pulsar and * subsequent * deceleration through an interaction with a suspected outer halo of unshocked ejecta @xcite .",
    "the presence of appreciable outer ejecta , however , remains highly controversial with several radio , optical , and x - ray observations failing to find any supportive evidence for its existence @xcite .",
    "* in any case , we view it as unlikely that the degree of any pwn acceleration and possible outer ejecta induced deceleration would be so nearly offsetting as to lead to the currently derived jet expansion date of around c.e .",
    "proper motion analysis of 35 ejecta knots in the northern filamentary jet in the crab nebula show the ejecta which form the jet to be less accelerated than the main body of the nebula . traced - back proper motions give an explosion date of 1055 @xmath124 c.e . which lie in much closer agreement to the appearance of the 1054 c.e .",
    "historical guest star .",
    "the measure proper motions are largely radial and directed away from the center of expansion .",
    "these data suggest the jet was likely formed in the original explosion possibly as a result of bipolar sn kinematics in which the e - w expansion of the ejecta was constrained by the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "this research was partially funded by a dof research grant , the orl ss program , and the richter memorial fund from dartmouth college .",
    "we thank molly hammell for considerable programming assistance and yuki nakamura for reduction of the suprime cam image .",
    "this work is based in part on data collected at subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
