    "the existence of unidirectionally propagating edge states is one of the most important features of two - dimensional systems in the presence of a magnetic field  @xcite . in particular , such _",
    "chiral _ edge states are responsible for the quantized conductance in the quantum hall effect , and their existence is guaranteed by a topological property of the bulk system , which does not depend on the specific type of edge termination .    in graphene , a strong artificial pseudo - magnetic field",
    "can be implemented through strain engineering @xcite , and associated relativistic pseudo - landau levels have been experimentally observed in the density of states @xcite .",
    "it is , _ prima facie _ , natural to expect propagating edge states also in the presence of such a pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "however , an important difference between the real magnetic field and the pseudo - magnetic field induced by strain is that , since strain does not break time reversal symmetry , the pseudo - magnetic field has opposite signs in the two dirac valleys .",
    "consequently , unlike for a real magnetic field , chiral edge states can not exist in the presence of only a pseudo - magnetic field . instead , _",
    "helical _ edge states can exist where states from different valleys experience opposite magnetic fields and propagate in opposite directions .",
    "it has been noted by several authors that such helical edge states do not always exist @xcite depending on the edge shape and the type of strain .",
    "however , a general condition specifying when propagating edge states exist is still lacking .    in this paper , we show that the existence of the helical edge states in strained honeycomb lattices strongly depends on the type of edge termination as well as on the type of strain .",
    "we also compare the strained system with a pristine lattice in the presence of a real magnetic field . we give a general criterion that explains the termination - dependence and the strain - dependence of the propagating edge states .",
    "the criterion is based on the chiral symmetry of the tight - binding hamiltonian , as well as on the particular form of landau levels .",
    "the criterion is confirmed through numerical simulations of both uni - axial and trigonal strain .",
    "our finding provides a powerful and simple way to build valley filters and control currents using strain and the engineering of the edge termination .",
    "this approach can be implemented in solid - state graphene as well as in artificial graphene for various platforms , such as photonic , optomechanical or phononic systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the system and review the main properties of the pseudo - landau levels in strained honeycomb lattices . in section [ sec : criterion ] we present our criterion for the existence of propagating edge states of the @xmath0-th pseudo - landau level . in section [ sec : uniaxial_dispersion ]",
    "we apply our criterion to two cases of uni - axial strain . in section [ sec : uniaxial_dispersiona ] we consider uni - axial strain along the @xmath1 direction to study the energy dispersion for the zigzag and bearded terminations . in section",
    "[ sec : uniaxial_dispersionb ] a uni - axial strain along the @xmath2 direction is considered to study the armchair termination . in section [ sec : magnetic_dispersion ] , we show that our criterion can also be applied to the case of a real magnetic field .",
    "the steady - state of artificial graphene under a coherent driving is studied in section  [ sec : steadystate ] for both the uni - axial and the trigonal strains .",
    "we also show that , by a controlled edge engineering , the propagating edge states can be valley filtered . finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we start by reviewing the main properties of relativistic pseudo - landau levels stemming from strain in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian of a strained honeycomb lattice with only nearest neighbour hopping takes , in real space , the following form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are annihilation operators of a particle at position @xmath6 in @xmath7 and @xmath8-sublattices , respectively .",
    "the vectors @xmath9 , with @xmath10 connect nearest neighbour sites , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , and @xmath11 is the nearest - neighbour hopping along @xmath9 . the first brillouin zone of the unstrained honeycomb lattice can be taken in the form of a hexagon , where the dirac points @xmath12 and @xmath13 are located at its corners .",
    "around such dirac points , when @xmath14 , the system has a linear energy dispersion , whose slope defines the dirac velocity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the effect of a spatially homogeneous strain can be described in momentum space around these dirac points @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a synthetic vector potential @xmath17 for the low energy modes @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the valley index which distinguishes between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the dirac velocity is , in general , no longer isotropic @xmath20 @xcite . from eq .",
    "we see that a non - uniform strain with position - dependent hoppings @xmath21 induces a non - zero synthetic pseudo - magnetic field @xmath22 . since the vector potential in eq .",
    "is opposite for the two valleys @xmath12 and @xmath13 , also the pseudo - magnetic field has opposite signs in the two valleys .",
    "we now review the properties of pseudo - landau levels for three different choices of the strain , highlighting the key features which will be important when presenting the criterion for the existence of propagating edge states .     and",

    "the vectors @xmath9 connect nearest neighbour sites . in the main text , we always refer to this orientation of the lattice . on the left edge",
    ", we show the bearded termination , while on the right edge we show the zigzag termination .",
    "the bottom and top edges have armchair terminations.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      we first consider the following uni - axial strain along the @xmath1 direction : @xmath23 the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 controls the amount of strain .",
    "when @xmath24 is positive ( negative ) , the strain increases ( decreases ) linearly towards the right edge .",
    "we choose the strain so that we have @xmath25 in the middle of the system .",
    "the @xmath1-dependent form of the strain in eq .",
    "is convenient for studying the zigzag and bearded edges for the system oriented as in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , since the system is translationally invariant along the @xmath2 direction under periodic boundary conditions along @xmath2 , and so the quasi - momentum @xmath26 is a good quantum number .",
    "we shall now concentrate on the case of positive @xmath24 , namely where the hopping along the @xmath1 direction is minimal at the left edge .",
    "the artificial pseudo - magnetic vector potential is @xmath27 , which is the landau gauge with the vector potential oriented along @xmath2 .",
    "the artificial magnetic field is @xmath28 , where the corresponding magnetic length is @xmath29 .",
    "relativistic pseudo - landau levels form near dirac points in momentum space and their energy levels at the dirac points are given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "for a given value of the  guiding center \" @xmath32 , the wavefunction of @xmath33-th pseudo - landau level in the @xmath34 sublattice basis is given by @xmath35 when @xmath36 and where @xmath37 is a hermite polynomial of degree @xmath33 .",
    "for the @xmath0-th pseudo - landau level , the wavefunction is a gaussian completely localized on the @xmath8-sublattice .",
    "each level is almost degenerate , since wavefunctions localized around different @xmath1-coordinates @xmath38 share the same energy up to a shift due to the position dependence of the dirac velocity @xcite .",
    "as we shall see better in section [ sec : criterion ] , depending on the details of the termination , when the guiding center @xmath38 hits the physical edge of the system , the energy of the pseudo - landau level can shift significantly from around its bulk value and the states are localized at the edge . since the energy dispersion acquires a non - zero slope as a function of @xmath26 , that is opposite around the two valleys , these states are helically - propagating edge states .",

    "we now consider the case of trigonal strain : @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the trigonal strain has been widely used in experiments on real graphene and allows us to realize a uniform pseudo - magnetic field in the symmetric gauge .",
    "this type of strain can be applied to solid - state graphene by engineering the distribution of the forces applied to the perimeter of the graphene flake @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0-th pseudo - landau level wavefuntion is again localized only on @xmath8-sublattice for a positive @xmath52 for both valleys .",
    "since the system is not translationally invariant in any direction , periodic boundary conditions can not be applied for studying the energy dispersion in momentum space .",
    "we therefore can not provide the analytical wavefunctions for the pseudo - landau levels , as we did for the uni - axial strains , and we discuss only the numerical results later in section [ sec : steadystate ] .",
    "we now give an intuitive physical criterion for the existence of propagating edge states for strained honeycomb lattices .",
    "the criterion is based on the chiral symmetry of the tight - binding hamiltonian , on the structure of the relativistic landau level wavefunction , and on the existence of non - propagating zero - energy edge states in the absence of a space - dependent strain .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .   has a chiral symmetry ; that is , under the transformation @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 . by applying this transformation to an eigenstate with energy @xmath56 , we obtain a different orthogonal eigenstate with energy @xmath57 where the sign of the wavefunction on the @xmath8-sublattice is flipped . as an important consequence ,",
    "if an eigenstate is localized only on one sublattice then , by the chiral symmetry , its energy must be zero .",
    "we now apply this argument to the landau levels when a guiding center is close to the edge of the system .",
