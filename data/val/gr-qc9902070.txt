    "spherically symmetric self - similar ( sss ) perfect - fluid solutions to einstein s equations have attracted considerable attention over the last two decades .",
    "although a nearly complete classification of such solutions has now been achieved , many of their features remain obscure .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the solution space and to unravel some of the physical properties of the solutions .",
    "there are a number of preferred geometric structures exhibited by the models , and these have led to several different approaches .",
    "two of the most commonly used are the ` comoving ' approach and the ` homothetic ' approach . in the comoving approach , pioneered by cahill & taub @xcite ,",
    "the coordinates are adapted to the fluid 4-velocity vector , whereas in the homothetic approach , introduced by bogoyavlensky and coworkers @xcite , they are adapted to the homothetic vector . the main advantage of the homothetic approach as presented by goliath et al .",
    "( @xcite ; gnu1 , gnu2 ) is that the state space is compact and regular .",
    "however , physically interesting quantities are more straightforward to obtain in the comoving approach , as shown by carr & coley ( @xcite ; cc ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that the two approaches are complementary , and consequently both will be used in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : geo ]",
    "we briefly summarize and compare the approaches of cc and gnu ; the discussion here is primarily qualitative , with most of the mathematics being relegated to [ app : eqs ] .",
    "one new result presented in this section is the complete state space for the sss models ( see figure [ fig : match ] ) . in section [ sec : results ] we focus on solutions of particular physical interest : the asymptotically friedmann models ; the so - called asymptotically quasi - static models , of which the naked - singularity solutions studied by ori & piran ( @xcite ; op ) are examples ; and a class of ` asymptotically minkowski ' solutions .",
    "we also mention the ` critical ' solution which has been discovered in gravitational collapse calculations , although we discuss this in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of sss solutions is the way in which their characteristics change at certain critical equations of state and we list these equation - of - state dependent features in section [ sec : eos ] . section [ sec : conc ] contains some concluding remarks and indicates possible future research directions .",
    "the governing equations of both approaches are given in [ app : eqs ] , together with expressions for some physically interesting quantities .",
    "in this section , we summarize the approaches of cc and gnu and discuss their relationship .",
    "we will consider an energy - momentum tensor of perfect - fluid form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy density , @xmath2 is the pressure , @xmath3 is the 4-velocity of the fluid and we choose units for which @xmath4 .",
    "the only barotropic equation of state compatible with the similarity ansatz is one of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant @xcite .",
    "causality requires @xmath7 .",
    "we will confine ourselves to positive pressure and the parameter interval @xmath8 .      in the spherically symmetric situation",
    "one can introduce a time coordinate @xmath9 such that surfaces of constant @xmath9 are orthogonal to fluid flow lines and comoving coordinates @xmath10 which are constant along each flow line .",
    "the metric can be written in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are functions of @xmath15 and @xmath9 .",
    "the equations have a first integral , @xmath16 , which can be interpreted as the mass within comoving radius @xmath15 at time @xmath9 . unless @xmath17 , this first integral decreases with increasing @xmath9 because of the work done by the pressure .",
    "spherically symmetric self - similar solutions can be put into a form in which all dimensionless quantities , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are functions only of the dimensionless self - similar variable @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "varying @xmath22 for a given @xmath9 specifies the spatial profile of various quantities . for a given value of @xmath15 ( i.e. , for a given fluid element ) ,",
    "it specifies their time evolution .",
    "some of these quantities have a particularly straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "thus @xmath23 is the scale factor , @xmath19 specifies the density profile at time @xmath9 and the mass function @xmath24 is related to the divergence of the congruence of outgoing null geodesics .",
    "values of @xmath22 for which @xmath25 correspond to a black hole or cosmological apparent horizon since this divergence is zero .",
    "another important quantity is the function @xmath26 which represents the velocity of the spheres of constant @xmath22 relative to the fluid .",
    "this should not be confused with the velocity of the fluid with respect to a schwarzschild foliation , the ` radial 3-velocity ' , which we denote by @xmath27 .",
    "special significance is attached to values of @xmath22 for which @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the first corresponds to a sonic point , the second to a black - hole event horizon or a cosmological particle horizon .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless function @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 the conservation equations @xmath32 can then be integrated to give @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are integration constants .",
    "the remaining field equations reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations in @xmath36 and @xmath23 ( given explicitly in [ app : comov ] ) .",
    "thus , the governing equations in the comoving approach consist of an effectively 2-dimensional system of non - autonomous ordinary differential equations . however , it is also useful to regard the solutions as trajectories in the 3-dimensional @xmath37 space ( where a dot denotes @xmath38 ) .",
    "each trajectory is parametrized by the similarity variable @xmath22 , so there is a 2-parameter family of spherically symmetric self - similar solutions for a given equation - of - state parameter @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath22 may be either positive or negative but it always has the same sign as @xmath39 .",
    "there is considerable arbitrariness in the selection of the axes that specify the solution space : although cc take them to be @xmath23 , @xmath40 and @xmath36 , foglizzo & henriksen ( @xcite ; fh ) take them to be @xmath1 , @xmath39 and a variable linearly related to @xmath40 . in either case , the functions have an obvious physical significance .",
    "the comoving approach thus has considerable intuitive appeal in that it affords immediate physical insights .",
    "for example , one can write down the metric explicitly and see immediately where the density goes infinite and the singularities occur .    one disadvantage of the comoving approach is that the similarity variable @xmath22 can be badly behaved .",
    "for example , sometimes finite values of @xmath22 correspond to zero or infinite physical distances from the origin and sometimes zero values of @xmath22 correspond to non - zero distances . also many solutions span both negative and positive values of @xmath22 , which means that @xmath22 must jump form @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "fh avoid this problem by using the coordinate @xmath43 but they then have a discontinuity at @xmath44 .",
    "another disadvantage is that the comoving approach , at least with the variables used by cc and fh , makes rigorous proofs of general features of sss solutions difficult .    in @xmath37 space",
    "the sonic condition @xmath45 specifies a 2-dimensional surface .",
    "where a curve intersects this surface , the equations do not uniquely determine @xmath46 ( i.e. , the pressure gradient ) , so there can be a number of different solutions passing through the same point .",
    "however , only integral curves which pass through a line q on the sonic surface , the _ sonic line _ , are ` regular ' in the sense that they can be extended beyond there .",
    "thus the sonic surface ` filters out ' the small subset of solutions that are physical .",
    "the behaviour near the sonic line can be treated as an eigenvalue problem @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the equations permit just two values of @xmath46 at each point of q and there will then be two corresponding values of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "if the values of @xmath47 are complex , corresponding to a _ focal _ point , then the solution will still be unphysical .",
    "if they are real , at least one of the values of @xmath47 must be positive . if both values of @xmath47 are positive , corresponding to a _",
    "point , the smaller value is associated with a 1-parameter family of solutions , while the larger one is associated with an isolated solution . the eigenvector direction associated with the 1-parameter set",
    "is referred to as _ dominant _ or _ primary _ and the other direction as _ secondary_. if one of the values of @xmath47 is negative , corresponding to a _",
    "point , both values are associated with isolated solutions .    on each side of a sonic point",
    ", @xmath46 may have either of the two values .",
    "if one chooses different values for @xmath46 , there will be a discontinuity in the density , pressure and velocity gradients .",
    "if one chooses the same value , there may still be a discontinuity in the higher derivatives of @xmath36 . only the isolated solution and a single member of the 1-parameter family of solutions are analytic ( or at least @xmath48 ) and these are associated with the two eigenvector directions .",
    "one can show that the part of q for which there is a 1-parameter family of solutions corresponds to two ranges of values for @xmath22 for each sign of @xmath22 .",
    "one range @xmath49 lies to the left of the friedmann sonic point @xmath50 and includes the static sonic point @xmath51 ; the other range @xmath52 includes the friedmann sonic point .",
    "these features are illustrated in figure [ fig : vz ] .",
    "when @xmath53 , it happens that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "cc have classified the @xmath5 sss solutions in terms of their asymptotic behaviour . the key steps in their analysis",
    "are : ( 1 ) a complete analysis of the dust ( @xmath17 ) solutions , since this provides a qualitative understanding of some of the solutions with pressure in the supersonic ( @xmath56 ) regime ; ( 2 ) an elucidation of the link between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 solutions ; ( 3 ) a proof that , at large and small values of @xmath59 , all self - similar solutions must have an asymptotic form in which @xmath36 and @xmath23 have a power - law dependence on @xmath22 ; and ( 4 ) a demonstration that there are only three _",
    "exact _ power - law solutions  the flat friedmann model , a self - similar static model and a self - similar kantowski - sachs model . prompted by results obtained by gnu , cc also find : ( 5 ) a family of power - law solutions which are ` asymptotically minkowski ' at large @xmath59 ; and ( 6 ) a family of solutions which are ` asymptotically minkowski ' at a _ finite _ value of @xmath22 and which have a power - law dependence on @xmath60 .",
    "these new solutions only exist for @xmath61 ; they were missed in cc s original analysis but they were then able to extend their work to include them .",
    "when the homothetic killing vector is non - null , the line element adapted to the homothetic vector field can be written in a diagonal form @xcite @xmath62 \\\\      e^{2t}d\\bar{s}^2\\!=\\!e^{2t}\\ !",
    "\\left[d_1\\!^2(x)dt^2 - dx^2 - d_2\\!^2(x)d\\omega^2\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\end{array }    \\right . \\ ! , \\ ] ] where we have distinguished between when the homothetic vector field is spacelike ( @xmath63 ; upper line element ) and when it is timelike ( @xmath64 ; lower line element ) .",
    "the unphysical spacetimes , @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , are hypersurface homogeneous @xcite and the approach used by gnu exploits similarities with the equations governing spatially homogeneous models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    by demanding that the energy density be non - negative , dominant quantities can be determined , and bounded dimensionless variables are obtained separately for the spatially and the timelike sss regions .",
    "in each of the two cases , a suitable dimensionless independent variable is chosen , so that only one dependent variable has dimensions . using these variables ,",
    "einstein s equations and the conservation equation @xmath32 result in a dynamical system in which the equation for the dimensionful variable is decoupled .",
    "the remaining equations form 4-dimensional autonomous dynamical systems , where the dynamical variables are related by a constraint ( see [ app : homoeq ] ) .",
    "one of the variables is @xmath39 , defined in the comoving context above .",
    "it is related to the tilt of the fluid flow with respect to the homothetic symmetry surfaces .",
    "since gnu introduce four bounded variables , locally related by a constraint ( for similar treatments , see @xcite ) , solutions are effectively treated as orbits in a compact 3-dimensional state space . the fact that the state space can be compactified is of great advantage in that one can visualize all the solutions at a glance and this will be exploited throughout this paper",
    ". however , the physical interpretation may still be difficult .",
    "for example , parts of the boundary of the state space are not always themselves self - similar , as exemplified by the non - self - similar kantowski - sachs state space that appears as a boundary submanifold of the spatially sss state space .",
    ".interpretation of solutions asymptotic to the given equilibrium points . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      it should be stressed that some of the differences between the two approaches are not intrinsic but merely reflect the particular realizations used by cc and gnu . for example , one could in principle use compactified variables in the comoving approach and one could also express solutions in terms of the similarity variable in the homothetic approach .",
    "indeed the variables used to represent the solutions in the two approaches must always be mathematically related in some way ( except in spacetime regions where one or both sets of coordinates break down ) . however , since the coordinate descriptions of the spacetime are very different , physical comparison is non - trivial .",
    "also , each approach suggests different ` natural ' dependent and independent variables , so variables found in one approach can be difficult to express in the other .",
    "cc emphasize the behaviour of solutions in the asymptotic limit @xmath67 , since the behaviour of solutions in this limit can only take one of a few simple forms ( asymptotically friedmann , asymptotically kantowski - sachs , and what they term asymptotically ` quasi - static ' ) .",
    "however , the limit @xmath67 does not usually play a crucial role in the gnu analysis but just corresponds to some region of their state space .",
    "in particular , there is no equilibrium point corresponding to cc s asymptotically quasi - static solutions since @xmath67 in this case corresponds to a surface _ within _ the state space .",
    "cc also discuss the behaviour of solutions in the limit @xmath68 and find that the solutions are either exactly static or asymptotically friedmann at the origin .",
    "cc place considerable emphasis on the form of the velocity function @xmath69 .",
    "this is useful if one wishes to identify event horizons , sonic points and physical singularities .",
    "( in the gnu analysis these conditions correspond respectively to the lines h , the surfaces @xmath28 and the equilibrium points k. ) however , it must be emphasized that the @xmath69 representation alone yields an incomplete understanding of solutions since one is projecting them onto a particular 2-dimensional plane , so that many physically distinct solutions may be superposed .",
    "for example , only in the @xmath53 ( radiation ) case does the region of the 3-dimensional solution space in which the mass is negative correspond to a well - defined region of @xmath69 space ; otherwise it depends on the third axis .",
    "cc also emphasize the form of the scale factor @xmath70 and the mass function @xmath71 .",
    "these quantities provide important physical insights into the solutions but one should bear in mind that they only represent different 2-dimensional projections of the full 3-dimensional state space .    in the homothetic approach ,",
    "the variables are chosen for their mathematical properties .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain a compact state space , and thus a complete visual picture of the solution space .",
    "the homothetic formulation also provides rigorous proofs and enables one to use the insights gained from bogoyavlensky s analysis @xcite . on the other hand , this approach is rather technical , and one can only indirectly gain physical insights .",
    "a complication in the diagonal homothetic approach is that the spacetime must be covered by several coordinate patches , since the coordinates break down when the homothetic killing vector becomes null , @xmath29 ( see section [ sec : hom ] ) .",
    "this is physically equivalent to when the fluid 4-velocity becomes null .",
    "since many sss solutions cross @xmath29 , one is forced to consider the relationship to other approaches if one wants to understand the global nature of each solution .",
    "thus , in order to investigate when and exactly how orbits pass from one regime to the other ( e.g. , timelike to spacelike ) in the homothetic approach , the dynamics are considered in the comoving approach .",
    "going back and forth between the homothetic and comoving approaches leads to a complete understanding of the dynamics across the null surface and allows a check of the internal consistency of both approaches .",
    "this is another illustration of how the two approaches are complementary and how it is only by using the two approaches in tandem that a full understanding is achieved .",
    "variable and coordinate transformations can be used to relate the comoving and homothetic variables explicitly ( see gnu1 , gnu2 @xcite ) , although care must be taken in effecting these transformations , and it should be noted that there are some typographical errors in appendix b of gnu1 .",
    "an alternative and perhaps a more elegant procedure is to use expressions for dimensionless quantities , such as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in each approach .",
    "together with the covariant expression for @xmath39 , given by cahill and taub @xcite ( see equation [ eq : vct ] ) , it is straightforward to use these to relate the variables of the two approaches .",
    "we should also mention the ` schwarzschild ' approach .",
    "this is useful when matching a self - similar interior region to an asymptotically flat ( non - self - similar ) exterior region .",
    "schwarzschild coordinates are also useful if one wishes to solve the equations of motion for the null geodesics , as required in studying the global structure of the solutions .",
    "consequently it was used by op to study naked singularities and the cosmic censorship hypothesis in the context of sss solutions .",
    "however , the disadvantage of schwarzschild coordinates is that they involve non - physical singularities ( see @xcite , pp .",
    "158159 ) .",
    "the transformations between comoving and schwarzschild coordinates are given explicitly by op .",
    "in this section , we discuss various types of solutions and their physical properties",
    ". the strategy will be to depict a given solution class in state space but  in order to extract physical features  to also plot the following physical quantities as functions of @xmath22 : the scale factor @xmath23 ; the velocity function @xmath39 ; the density profile @xmath72 ; and the mass function @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "another quantity of physical interest is the asymptotic energy per unit mass @xmath75 and this will be useful in parametrizing solutions .",
    "the expressions for these quantities are collected in [ app : physical ] .",
    "solutions can be classified by considering their global features , as well as their asymptotic properties .",
    "one possibility is to consider their differentiability .",
    "another is to use the global causal properties of the homothetic killing vector @xmath76 and we now consider this .",

    "( 3 ) there are also solutions , such as the flat friedmann solution , for which @xmath76 changes causality once .",
    "( 4 ) solutions with two causality changes include , for example , the static solution and some asymptotically friedmann solutions that recollapse .",
    "( 5 ) solutions that undergo three changes of the causality include those that develop a naked singularity . for more examples ,",

    "the parameter characterizing these solutions measures the underdensity or overdensity relative to the flat friedmann solution and is also associated with the asymptotic energy @xmath75 . in terms of the gnu state space ,",
    "the asymptotically friedmann solutions start at the f equilibrium points in the spatially sss region ( see figure [ fig : afgnu ] , where one of the two equivalent families of the asymptotically friedmann solutions is depicted ) .",
    "physically interesting quantities are illustrated in figure [ fig : afcc ] .",
    "the @xmath57 solutions correspond to inhomogeneous models that start from an initial big bang singularity at @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and then , as @xmath22 decreases , either expand to infinity or recollapse .",

    "these transonic solutions represent density fluctuations that grow at the same rate as the particle horizon @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that these solutions can generally only be matched to the centre non - analytically . while there is a continuum of regular underdense solutions , regular overdense solutions only occur in narrow bands ( with just one solution per band being analytic ) . the overdense solutions exhibit oscillations in the subsonic region , with the number of oscillations labeling the band .",
    "solutions with larger number of oscillations form ever narrower bands within the one - oscillation band ( in terms of the ranges of @xmath22 at q ) .",
    "the existence of these subsonic bands was first pointed out by bogoyavlensky @xcite and also studied by ori & piran @xcite , carr & yahil @xcite and gnu2 .",
    "the higher bands are all nearly static near the sonic point ( @xmath88 ) , although they deviate from the static solution and approach the equilibrium point c as @xmath68 .",

    "one of these parameters can be taken to be the asymptotic energy @xmath75 , while the other ( denoted by @xmath90 ) can be related to the value of @xmath22 at the big bang or big crunch singularity .",

    "for example , the class includes expanding models that finally recollapse .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by some of the state - space orbits in figure [ fig : aqsgnu ] .",
    "the key feature of these solutions is that they span both negative and positive values of @xmath22 .",
    "whereas the asymptotically friedmann solutions are confined to @xmath57 or @xmath58 and are symmetric in @xmath22 ( changing the sign of @xmath22 just reverses the time direction ) , the asymptotically quasi - static solutions are in general asymmetric in @xmath22 and necessarily pass from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "this is because the big bang occurs at @xmath93 ( corresponding to a non - zero value of @xmath9 ) in these solutions , so the limit @xmath67 has no particular physical significance .",

    "the continued evolution for @xmath57 resembles the evolution of case ( 1 ) : as @xmath22 further decreases , @xmath39 first reaches a minimum and then diverges to infinity when it encounters the singularity at @xmath109",
    ". the minimum will be below 1 if @xmath75 is less than some negative value @xmath110 , and in this case one necessarily has a naked singularity , as pointed out by op .",
    "particular examples of this are some of the general - relativistic penston - larson solutions ( see figure 13 of op ) .",

    "the behaviour in the subsonic regime is equivalent to that discussed in case ( 2a ) .",
    "the ever - expanding solutions are not represented in figures [ fig : aqsgnu ] and [ fig : aqscc ] .",
    "however , they can be obtained from the ever - collapsing ones ( dashed curves ) by letting @xmath112 and @xmath113 .      in this section",
    "we will discuss the ` asymptotically minkowski ' solutions , a class of self - similar solutions that were only discovered very recently and are of particular relevance to critical phenomena , see @xcite for further details .",
    "these were missed in cc s original asymptotic analysis , although they were able to extend their work after gnu had demonstrated the existence of such solutions .",
    "by combining the two approaches , we gain further physical insights into their significance .",
    "there are actually two families of asymptotically minkowski solutions and both are only physical for @xmath114 :    \\a ) the first family is described by two parameters and is associated with the equilibrium points m in state space .",

    "is illustrated by the dotted curves in figures [ fig : mgnu ] and [ fig : mcc ] .",
    "although the value of @xmath22 is finite at the m point , it should be noted out that the schwarzschild radial distance ( @xmath119 ) is infinite .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure [ fig : mcc ] , where @xmath23 goes to infinity for finite values of @xmath22 .",
    "\\b ) the second family is described by one parameter and is associated with the equilibrium points @xmath120 in state space .",
    "the solutions in this family have @xmath121 , @xmath106 and @xmath116 as @xmath122 .",
    "the expression for @xmath123 is @xmath124 in figures [ fig : mgnu ] and [ fig : mcc ] , the dashed curves correspond to this family of solutions .",
    "both families of solutions have @xmath125 as a solution approaches m or @xmath126 .",

    "it is important to realize that these solutions are not asymptotically flat in the usual sense .",
    "rather , they are perfect - fluid spacetimes for which the minkowski geometry is obtained asymptotically along certain coordinate lines .",
    "this is reminiscent of the open friedmann solutions , which asymptotically approaches the milne model along certain timelines ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    as can be seen in figures [ fig : mgnu ] and [ fig",
    ": mcc ] , both families contain solutions that can be connected either to the origin @xmath44 ( via a sonic point ) or to a non - isotropic singularity ( for which @xmath82 at finite values @xmath128 ) .",
    "the former are of type ts , while the latter are of type s or sts , using the classification of section [ sec : class ] . for both families ,",
    "the limit @xmath106 can be regarded as corresponding to an infinitely dispersed state , analogous to the late stage of an open friedmann model , which is described by the milne solution , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "note that there is a 1-parameter family of non - isotropic singularity solutions for each value of @xmath128 ( i.e. , one can take one of the two parameters that specify the solutions near k to be the value of the similarity variable at k )",
    ". most of these will be asymptotic to either a type a asymptotically minkowski solution or a quasi - static solution .",
    "however , for sufficiently large values of @xmath129 , there will also be one type b asymptotically minkowski solution and one asymptotically friedmann solution , all connected with k. the limiting value of @xmath128 is the same in each case , reflecting the fact that the conditions at large values of @xmath59 have little influence on what happens near the singularity .",
    "this limiting value corresponds to the splitting of the asymptotically friedmann and asymptotically @xmath126 submanifolds : the orbits belonging to each separatrix surface can be described by one parameter . for some ranges of this parameter",
    "they are asymptotic to a k equilibrium point , corresponding to a non - isotropic singularity ; for other ranges they have a sonic point .",
    "this is illustrated for the asymptotically minkowski solutions in figure [ fig : mgnu ] , where dashed curves correspond to type b solutions .",
    "the analogous behaviour of the asymptotically friedmann solutions can be seen in figure [ fig : afgnu ] .",
    "there are several features of the solutions that depend on the equation - of - state parameter @xmath6 . in particular",
    ", the behaviour at the sonic line is greatly affected by the equation of state .",
    "below , we list some of these equation - of - state dependent features .    * @xmath130 : the boundary of the underdense subsonic band ( see subsection [ sec : af ] ) changes with increasing @xmath6 from being the general - relativistic penston - larson solution to the degenerate node in the nodal region containing the flat friedmann solution ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) . *",
    "@xmath132 : the upper boundary ( as defined by op ) of the first overdense subsonic band changes with increasing @xmath6 from being a secondary eigenvector direction in the nodal region containing the static solution to the degenerate node of that nodal region ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) . *",
    "@xmath134 : the equilibrium points @xmath135 leave each timelike sss state space and enter the spatially sss state space as the equilibrium points @xmath120 . * @xmath136 : the critical solution , which corresponds to the lower boundary of the first overdense subsonic band , changes character with increasing @xmath6 from a solution with a ( generally irregular ) second sonic point to a solution whose corresponding orbit ends at an m point in the spatially sss state space . for the threshold value of @xmath6",
    ", the critical solution ends at an @xmath126 point .",
    "* @xmath53 : the degenerate nodes of the nodal regions of the sonic line coincide with , respectively , the flat friedmann solution and the static solution ( i.e. , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) . + the eigenvector direction at the sonic line of the flat friedmann solution changes with increasing @xmath6 from being a dominant direction to a secondary direction . for the static solution , the situation is reversed : the eigenvector direction going from being secondary to dominant . + the boundary of the underdense subsonic band changes with increasing @xmath6 from being the degenerate node in the nodal region containing the flat friedmann solution to the flat friedmann solution itself ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) .",
    "* @xmath140 : the eigenvector direction associated with the critical solution at the sonic line changes with increasing @xmath6 from being an attractive eigenvector direction in the saddle region of the sonic line to a secondary eigenvector direction in the nodal region containing the static solution ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) . * @xmath142 : the overdense subsonic bands overlap , so that the band structure degenerates to only two bands : the underdense band and one overdense band .",
    "* @xmath143 : the zero in the radial 3-velocity @xmath27 of the critical solution changes with increasing @xmath6 from being subsonic to being supersonic ( i.e. , for this value of @xmath6 , @xmath144 when @xmath28 ) . * @xmath145 : the eigenvector direction associated with the critical solution at the sonic line coincides with the degenerate node in the nodal region associated with the static solution ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) , and changes with increasing @xmath6 from being a secondary eigenvector direction to a dominant eigenvector direction .",
    "it is clear from the present work that we are close to a complete understanding of the self - similar spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "this paper has emphasized the advantages of a combined comoving and homothetic approach .",
    "this is particularly clear in the investigations of the asymptotically quasi - static solutions and asymptotically minkowski solutions .",
    "an important application is to study the critical solution of spherically symmetric perfect - fluid collapse .",
    "this has been done in a separate paper @xcite , where it is shown that the critical solution is the unique self - similar solution which is analytic at the sonic point , has a regular centre , and contains one collapsing region surrounded by a dispersing exterior . as indicated in section [ sec : eos ] , this solution is a member of the asymptotically quasi - static class for @xmath146 , a member of the asymptotically minkowski class of type b for @xmath136 , and a member of the asymptotically minkowski class of type a for @xmath147 .",
    "possible future investigations involve studying these models in more general contexts",
    ". one might ask if various features discussed here are structurally stable , i.e. , how do other geometries and matter sources affect the behaviour ?",
    "for example , one might further examine the role of the self - similar solutions in the complete space of spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "it also remains to consider the stiff fluid ( @xmath148 ) case , which is of relevance in the study of massless scalar fields .",
    "there are numerous bifurcations associated with the limit @xmath149 and this explains the numerical problems one encounters in this limit .",
