    ", definite non - perturbative results may be obtained from an appropriately resummed ( but different ) expansion , like the @xmath9 expansion@xcite .",
    "there also exist powerful summation techniques , like the borel method@xcite which , even for non borel - summable expansions like in qcd typically , gives nevertheless precious informations on the nature of ( power - like ) non - perturbative contributions to a given physical quantity .",
    "an alternative summation method , known as delta - expansion ( de ) or  variationally improved perturbation \" ( vip)@xcite , is based on a reorganization of the interaction lagrangian to depend on arbitrary adjustable parameters , to be fixed by some optimization prescription . in various models",
    "de - vip exhibits ( though often rather empirically ) an improved convergence of perturbative expansion .",
    "moreover in some @xmath0 models , the anharmonic oscillator typically , de - vip is equivalent@xcite to the  order - dependent mapping \" ( odm ) method@xcite , and optimization is equivalent to a rescaling of the adjustable oscillator frequency ( mass ) with perturbative order , which can essentially suppress the factorial asymptotic behaviour of ordinary perturbative coefficients .",
    "such a procedure was proven rigorously to converge@xcite ( for an adequately rescaled mass ) toward the exact result , e.g. for the oscillator energy levels@xcite and related quantities .    here",
    "we reconsider a variant of de - vip adapted to higher dimensional renormalizable theories , proposed some time ago@xcite@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to perform a modification of perturbative expansions in two stages : first exploiting specific renormalization group ( rg ) properties , which transform the ordinary expansion ( in a coupling @xmath10 ) of certain physical quantities , depending only on @xmath10 and on a mass @xmath11 , in the alternative form of  mass power \" expansions ( mpe ) in @xmath12 [ @xmath13 is the renormalization scale - invariant mass , @xmath14 the basic rg scale and @xmath15 is given by known rg coefficients ] . this construction resums rg dependence to all orders ( at least in specific schemes ) , and most interestingly exhibits a non - trivial massless ( chiral ) limit@xcite for dsb ( sb ) order parameters , or for analogous quantities like the  mass gap \" in @xmath16 models@xcite .",
    "however , such a result turns out to be well - defined only in the approximation of neglecting all the purely perturbative ( non rg ) dependence .",
    "when arbitrary large orders of the complete ( non - log ) perturbative series are included , our naive mass gap result is plagued with ambiguities originating mainly from renormalon singularities , cf .",
    "point ( iii ) above , as we shall examine in more details here",
    ".    however , in a second stage , an appropriate version of the ( order dependently rescaled ) de - vip can be performed on the complete mpe series in @xmath17 , essentially replacing the true physical mass by an arbitrary adjustable mass parameter . in this note",
    "we mainly investigate the large order behaviour of the resulting  variational \" expansion in this mass parameter .",
    "we find that it produces a renormalization scheme ( rs ) dependent factorial _ damping _ of the original perturbative coefficients at large orders . yet , unlike the oscillator case ,",
    "the damping is generally not sufficient to make the de - vip series readily convergent , in the standard perturbative regime , when the generically expected renormalon singularities are taken into account .",
    "but we show that the series can be _ borel _ convergent , if approaching the chiral limit with the arbitrary mass parameter @xmath18 { \\raisebox{-0.13cm}{~\\shortstack{$<$ \\\\[-0.07 cm ] $ \\sim$}}~}0 $ ] .",
    "these results apply formally a priori to any ( asymptotically free ) renormalizable models .",

    "@xmath9 result in the @xmath19 gn model @xmath19 gn model mass gap , independently of the present construction , is analysed in details in @xcite . ] : in this model the @xmath160 in ( [ directbs ] ) is more precisely replaced by @xmath161 , and the exact result@xcite has an asymptotic expansion@xcite similar to ( [ directbs ] ) , except for a finite term @xmath162 , which not suprisingly can not be guessed by our simple borel summation of the ( leading ) renormalon behaviour in eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) .",
    "though renormalon ambiguities are perturbative artifacts expected to disappear ( or more precisely to cancel out with ope contributions ) in truly non - perturbative calculations@xcite , such explicit cancellations are generally inaccessible for theories like qcd . rather , the peculiar damping mechanism of factorial divergences exhibited here is intuitively due to the fact that our reorganization of perturbative expansions makes those much more similar to the oscillator energy levels expansion , exhibiting a dependence on @xmath163 , eq .",
    "( [ fexp ] ) , which is _ power - like _ ( rather than log - like ) for sufficiently small @xmath164 . moreover , the adjustable parameter @xmath163 may be order - dependently rescaled , or can take arbitrary values , in particular @xmath165<0 $ ] producing sign alternation of factorial coefficients .",
    "the de - vip expansion appears in that way to `` bypass '' the need for explicit ( and generally complicated ) cancellation between perturbative and non - perturbative contributions , at least for certain physical quantities like the mass gap .",
    "note also that the linear de - vip taking the form ( [ contour1 ] ) , and ( [ bivarbis ] ) when combined with the borel method , is only one among other possible similar resummations .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that the obtained convergence properties for @xmath152 < 0 $ ] ( @xmath165<0 $ ] ) do not depend on the detailed properties of the  delta - expansion \" contour integrals here considered , e.g. eq .  ( [ contour1 ] ) [ which lead however to a rather simple and tractable expressions in the massless limit and for borel transforms eqs .  ( [ bivarbis])([mpbsum ] ) ] : more generally applying the @xmath74-expansion idea in slightly different forms may replace ( [ mpolesum ] ) and subsequent results with eventually different series  @xcite , but with similar asymptotic and ( borel ) convergence properties . + in summary , our construction exhibits an explicit counter - example to conventional wisdom arguments ( i)(ii ) , and to some extent ( iii ) , mentioned in introduction .",
    "in the present paper we have only analyzed the formal borel convergence properties , a priori applicable to any aft , relying essentially on the properties of @xmath49 in eqs .",
    "( [ fdef]),([f2def ] ) , interpolating smoothly from the ordinary perturbative coupling to the infrared mass power expansion .",
    "these convergence properties can be viewed as the generalization to @xmath112 renormalizable theories of the ordinary convergence properties of the de - vip for the oscillator@xcite .",
    "next we argue that such a summation recipe can provide a well - defined basis to estimate more precisely some of the sb order parameters in qcd or other models , and a more detailed study with concrete numerical applications to the gn model and qcd will be explored in @xcite .",
    "though one may eventually raise that in qcd - like theories , other contributions to the sb order parameters of  truly non - perturbative \" origin ( i.e. unreachable by any resummation mean , and/or related e.g. to instanton phenomena typically ) may be expected , the resummation contributions here considered should be a useful piece of information . + * acknowledgements * + we thank andr neveu for valuable discussions related to this work , and martin beneke and georges grunberg for useful previous discussions on the general properties of renormalons .",
