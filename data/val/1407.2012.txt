    "handling high current proton beams is a challenge for beam diagnostics in future proton accelerators . in order to achieve a high beam power ,",
    "it is mandatory to understand the beam dynamics and to determine the beam size and profile with precision . in high power proton linacs",
    ", such understanding would allow a full characterization of the beam after each linac section . with a beam transverse size of 2 to ,",
    "intercepting profile diagnostics such as otr screens or cherenkov monitors can be used only during tuning and specific beam operation modes . to determine the longitudinal profile , feschenko - type bunch shape monitors ( bsm @xcite )",
    "can be used in the low energy sections of the linac , however , bsm may not be sensitive to short bunch lengths . in the higher energy sections ,",
    "it is highly advisable to use non interceptive devices to avoid radiations or damage to the equipment .",
    "wall current monitors or other methods based on detecting the fields at the vacuum chamber boundary could be used , but they are intrinsically limited in resolution due to the rather low relativistic @xmath0 @xcite and do not have an adapted temporal resolution .",
    "therefore , a diagnostic based on smith - purcell radiation could be of high interest .",
    "we will investigate here the possibility of using a smith - purcell diagnostic for the measurement of proton beams longitudinal profiles , using a numerical simulation code presented hereafter .",
    "smith - purcell radiation can be described by the `` surface current '' theory @xcite : when charged particles travel over a grating , they induce an image charge on its surface and keep pace with it .",
    "the corrugations of the grating cause the created current to accelerate , which in turn leads to the emission of radiation . in our coordinate system",
    ", we assume that the protons travel perpendicularly to the grooves of a blazed grating .",
    "due to the periodic structure of the grating , the emitted wavelength @xmath1 depends on the observation angle @xmath2 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] .",
    "the grating shape and pitch defines its efficiency , that varies depending on @xmath2 and on the second observation angle called @xmath3 .",
    "our simulation describes the smith - purcell intensity radiated per unit solid angle for a single particle , as described in the equation ( 2a ) of @xcite for a grating of period _",
    "l _ and length z positioned at a distance @xmath4 from the beam center :    @xmath5\\ ] ]    the term @xmath6 represents the grating efficiency that contains the contribution from each period of the grating , and is different for each grating shape @xcite . here",
    "we use echelette gratings whose efficiency will be shown in the results section .    for a given bunch of @xmath7 particles ,",
    "the emitted radiation has a high degree of coherence when the radiation wavelength is comparable to the bunch length . in the equation (",
    "[ equ : coherence ] ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the coherent and incoherent components of the emitted radiation respectively . assuming that the transverse and longitudinal profiles are not correlated , @xmath8 can be expressed as the product two functions _",
    "t _ and _ g _ encoding the longitudinal ( temporal ) and transverse profile respectively . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the beam dimensions in x and y directions , and @xmath12 is the frequency .",
    "@xmath13    @xmath14    in the case where the coherent component prevails , the emitted radiation encodes the form factor of the bunch and its measurement allows to recover information about the bunch longitudinal profile .",
    "if we assume that the beam is gaussian in the transverse plane and _ g _ is normalized to 1 , then the emitted energy is proportional to the form factor as shown in [ equ : approxcoherence ] .",
    "@xmath15    this form factor corresponds to the modulus of the fourier transform of the temporal profile . in order to recover the full profile the phase needs to be reconstructed .",
    "several techniques are possible , and are documented in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we use a code package written by g. doucas @xcite , that takes several beam parameters as an input and generates the a smith - purcell spectrum , which is a calculation made from the fourier transform of the temporal profile and chosen grating parameters .",
    "the parameters used for this study on proton beams are summarized in table [ tab : beamparameters ] .",
    "we assume that the beam transverse dimensions would allow approaching a grating at a distance @xmath16 from the beam center .",
    ".used beam parameters for the simulation [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : gratingparameters ]",
    "knowing the expected signal level , it is now necessary to verify that the device is sensitive to a longitudinal profile change , which is a crucial feature for a profile measurement tool .",
    "the sensitivity to a variation in the bunch fwhm length is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : bunchlength ] for the chosen grating and optics parameters .",
    "the coherent emission becomes progressively predominant as the bunch length decreases , which leads to a significant and measurable signal increase .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bunchlength ] , where the wavelength at @xmath2 = 90varies by more than 20% for a bunch length varying from 3 to , but a similar change is also observed at other wavelengths showing a significant change of the power spectrum distribution .        the signal level for the simulated case , as shown in fig . [ fig : bunchlength ] , is of the order of per bunch , and needs to be compared with the performances of the detectors used . for example ,",
    "if the detectors measure an averaged signal over several ms , which is the case of the pyroelectric sensors often used in experiments involving electrons @xcite , they will detect the smith - purcell power produced by a whole train ( around bunches ) , thus a higher signal by several orders of magnitude , up to mj .",
    "however , these values do not take into account the transmission of the different optical elements that would need to be installed in front of the detectors .",
    "also , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] , the expected smith - purcell emission would occur in the millimeter - wave range where the background level needs to be evaluated to be able to distinguish it from the actual signal .",
    "if we use detectors that are sensitive only to signal variations , they will not impacted by the effect of the temperature . however",
    ", electromagnetic noise and other sources of radiations related to the beam can create background .",
    "since the smith - purcell radiation is linearly polarized , a way to decorrelate the signal and the background could then be to measure the two polarization components .",
    "angle , for different @xmath2 values .",
    "the emission source is the center of the figure , the detection optics would be placed on the right half of the figure.,width=340 ]    the efficiency of the grating is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] depending on the @xmath3 angle .",
    "this indicates that most of the radiation would be emitted along the x axis in a cone of approximately 40opening , allowing all signal to enter the optics .",
    "our simulations indicate that with the parameters used for our simulation a longitudinal bunch profile monitor based on coherent smith - purcell radiation installed at near a high intensity proton beam would be sensitive to changes in the pulse length and could be useful in the tuning phase of such accelerator .",
    "however such device has never been tested at low @xmath0 proton beams and preliminary tests on a high intensity proton source would be useful .",
    "the authors acknowledge george doucas from john adams institute in oxford for his useful advice ."
