    "the periodic orbit theory @xcite has made important contributions to the understanding of quantum chaos @xcite and to the semiclassical interpretation of quantum shell effects in finite fermion systems @xcite . through semiclassical trace formulae , it relates the density of states of a quantum hamiltonian to the sum over all periodic orbits of the corresponding classical hamiltonian system .",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite assumes the periodic orbits to be isolated and therefore applies most directly to chaotic systems ; it can , however , also be used for integrable systems with isolated orbits ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the derivation of the trace formula @xcite ,",
    "the stationary phase approximation is used for evaluating some of the trace integrals over the semiclassical amplitude , leading to gauss - fresnel integrals . in systems with regular or mixed classical dynamics",
    ", periodic orbits can undergo bifurcations at critical values of a system parameter ( e.g. , energy or deformation ) . at such critical points , one or more of the gauss - fresnel integrals become singular and cause the divergence of the gutzwiller amplitudes of the bifurcating orbits .",
    "this situation can be remedied @xcite by going to higher than second - order terms in the expansion of the action function , which appears in the phase of the trace integrand , around the critical point in phase space .",
    "the minimum number of terms required in this expansion are given by the so - called normal forms , which are characteristic for each type of bifurcation ( see also @xcite ) and lead to usually well - known catastrophe integrals .",
    "at the bifurcation points , one obtains in this way _ local uniform approximations _ for the semiclassical amplitudes that are finite and contain the contributions of all orbits involved in the bifurcation .",
    "the local uniform approximations do , however , not reproduce the correct asymptotic gutzwiller amplitudes far away from the bifurcation point where all involved orbits are isolated . to achieve this goal , _",
    "global uniform approximations _ must be developed which interpolate smoothly from the local behavior at the bifurcation to the asymptotic regions of the isolated orbits .",
    "this has been done in refs .",

    "@xcite , which inspired those mentioned above for bifurcations as well as global uniform approximations for the breaking of other symmetries @xcite . )    in this paper we investigate a type of bifurcation that has not yet been studied in this context and that we term _ bridge orbit bifurcation_. typically , this bifurcation consists of a pair of isolated orbits which are connected through a `` bridge orbit '' that only exists in a finite interval of the system parameter . under its monotonous variation ,",
    "the bridge orbit is born at a bifurcation of the first isolated orbit and then absorbed at a bifurcation of the second isolated orbit .",
    "this scenario has been found in both integrable and non - integrable hamiltonian systems@xcite .",
    "it occurs , e.g. , in the two - dimensional rationally deformed harmonic oscillator under a generic class of perturbations ; other examples will be given in section [ sec : bridge ] .",
    "in the integrable case the bridge orbit forms a continuously degenerate family ( i.e. , a rational torus ) , while in non - integrable cases it is typically isolated .",
    "since the two isolated orbits which exchange the bridge orbit typically are well separated in phase space , the bridge bifurcation is accompanied by global changes of the phase space structure which can not be treated with the usual perturbative normal forms derived from the birkoff - gustavson expansion .",
    "this is different from the generic bifurcations of codimension one @xcite , and also from those of codimension two considered in @xcite , where only local changes in the phase space structure occur around a central periodic orbit that exists at all values of the relevant system parameter .    in all the bifurcation types",
    "investigated so far in connection with uniform approximations , _ all _ orbits participating in the bifurcations become asymptotically isolated far enough from the bifurcation point(s ) .",
    "even in the codimension - two bifurcations considered in @xcite , where some isolated orbits only exist between two adjacent bifurcations , these have their well - defined partners which become asymptotically isolated at least on one side of one of the bifurcations . for the bridge orbits studied here , this is not the case .",
    "the bridge orbits are entirely intrinsic to the bifurcation scenario and can not be linked to any ` external ' orbit existing far away from the bifurcation .",
    "this causes a generic problem in the construction of the global uniform approximations which will be discussed in section [ sec : uniform ] .    in section [ sec :",

    "[ sec : uniform ] , we derive local and global uniform approximations from this normal form , give analytic trace formulae for the semiclassical density of states and compare its numerically computed results with fully quantum - mechanical results for the corresponding quantum hamiltonians . section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks .    in the following sections , numerical integrations of the classical equations of motion",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath99 this becomes particularly useful when one considers integrable systems for which the normal form function does not depend on the angle @xmath100 , so that one only has to deal with a function @xmath101 depending on two variables .",
