    "in general , the certification of _ entanglement _ @xcite requires to perform specific measurements on the quantum state one is willing to test @xcite . experimentally , this is a delicate task since mismatches between either the state or the measurements and their actual physical implementation may lead to false - positive conclusions about the presence of entanglement in the network @xcite .",
    "although such mismatches can in principle be patched in experimental setups , the situation becomes dramatic when considering applications , where the devices used are not trusted as they could have been provided and controlled by some adversary .",
    "one solution to this problem is the use of _ device - independent _ techniques @xcite , for which no assumption is made on the devices that generate the state or perform the measurements . in this approach",
    "the devices are seen as black boxes , accessed only with classical inputs ( corresponding to the measurement choices ) and providing classical outputs ( corresponding to the measurement outcomes ) .",
    "although such _ device - independent entanglement witnesses _ have been soundly considered in the past years @xcite , their physical implementation turns out to be very demanding @xcite for it requires one to observe a bell inequality violation without the presence of loopholes @xcite .",
    "a midpoint among the aforementioned cases is the _ semi - device independent _ approach , which relies on the presence of _ quantum steering _ @xcite to certify entanglement in the network .",
    "this is an asymmetric situation in the sense that only some of the parties in the network use trusted devices while others do not @xcite .",
    "this approach is less demanding experimentally than the device - independent case , but it still presents practical interest for adversarial situations ; for instance , one could think of a practical semi - device independent network composed by a single central trusted provider , while the remaing parties , the clients , hold untrusted devices . for these reasons",
    "the study of quantum steering has increased substantively in recent years @xcite .",
    "methods to certify all kinds of multipartite entanglement in semi - device independent networks were presented -and experimentally demonstrated- very recently in ref .",
    "these methods rely on _ semi - definite programming _",
    "( sdp ) techniques .",
    "they represent an important achievement for the certification of entanglement in quantum networks .",
    "in fact , these techniques certify entanglement in networks with amounts of noise that make them undetectable by the existing fully device - independent techniques @xcite .    here",
    "we apply such semi - device independent entanglement certification techniques to the three - qubit w state .",
    "our motivation to consider the w state is two - fold .",
    "first , this state displays both genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) and entanglement in its reduced states , being then a flexible resource for the implementation of quantum networks .",
    "this is not the case for the ghz state implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite , as its reduced state is separable .",
    "second , it is not known whether the reduced state of the w state can violate any bell inequality @xcite , while here we show that it does present steering .    in this paper",
    "we show that by sharing a w state , every party can detect all types of entanglement without the need of trusting the measurements that the other parties are performing .",
    "this puts the w state as a promising candidate to implement asymmetric cryptographic protocols .",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of such aforementioned techniques for entanglement certification in a proof - of - principle photonic experiment .",
    "additionally , we use the recent methods for one - sided device independent randomness certification presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the amount of randomness that can be obtained in bipartitions of the w state .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.witnesses ] we first provide a general overview on the construction of semi - device independent witnesses required for all types of entanglement .",
    "then , in sec .",

    "[ sec.conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we first recall the methods of ref.@xcite to construct multipartite semi - device independent entanglement witnesses .",
    "the intuition is the following . assuming that the quantum state ( denoted by @xmath0 ) distributed in the network is separable according to some particular decomposition ( _ e.g _ fully separable , separable across any bipartition , etc . )",
    "imposes constraints on the collection of all possibly observable set of post - measured states that the untrusted parties create for the trusted ones . from these constraints",
    "one can then determine if the original state @xmath0 could have the considered decomposition with sdp techniques in an efficient way .",
    "this sdp also provides experimentally friendly entanglement witnesses .      for illustrative purposes and simplicity",
    "we narrow our focus to the distribution of @xmath0 among three parties , a , b and c , but it is worth noting that the witness constructions that will be presented can indeed be generalized for a larger number of parties .",
    "two semi - device independent cases arise ; namely , either one or two of the parties could be holding untrusted devices in the network . in the case",
    "where one party , say a , uses untrusted devices , it will be first interesting to analyze the reduced asymmetric network that stems between a and b when discarding the third party c ( top - left of fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a bipartite steering scenario and the witness for such case will be derived in sec .",
    "[ sec.redent ] .",
    "note that the certification of entanglement in the reduced state shared by a and b guarantees the presence of entanglement across bipartitions a : bc and ac : b , regardless of whether c trusts his measurement device or not .    a slightly more complicated task is to certify tripartite entanglement when either one or two parties hold untrusted devices ( top - right and bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] , respectively ) .",
    "equivalently , this task requires to decide whether the original state @xmath0 is fully separable or not , and we will construct the witness necessary to answer this question in sec .  [ sec.fullent ] .",
    "next , the question will be extended for genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) in sec .",
    "[ sec.gme ] by asking if the state is biseparable .",
    "we start by analyzing the presence of entanglement in the reduced bipartite system left to a and b when c is disregarded ( see top - left in fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] ) . in this case",
    "a and b are left with the quantum state @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the measurements performed by a on her share of @xmath2 are untrusted and therefore they are described by unknown positive operators @xmath3 summing to identity for each @xmath4 , where @xmath4 labels the measurement chosen by a and @xmath5 the obtained outcome .",
    "on the other hand b is trusted and can thus perform quantum tomography on his share to observe an ( unnormalized ) conditional state : @xmath6,\\ \\ \\ \\forall\\ a , x . \\label{eq.sigbax}\\ ] ] note that the statistics observed by a can be recovered from the relation ( born rule ) @xmath7 $ ] , and thus the collection @xmath8 known as a _ quantum assemblage _ @xcite , contains all the information obtainable in this measurement scenario . if @xmath2 is not entangled , it reads : @xmath9 where @xmath10 defines some probability distribution . in this case , the assemblage takes the form : @xmath11 with @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "a decomposition for @xmath13 of the form is a typical instance of an assemblage admitting a _ local hidden state _ ( lhs ) model @xcite . the collection of all such unnormalized assemblages admitting an lhs model for b forms a convex set which we denote @xmath14 . concretely : @xmath15 where we have used the fact that any probability distribution @xmath16 can always be written as a convex combination of deterministic strategies @xmath17 .",
    "( note that the constraints inside the brackets in involve all values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 ; unless otherwise specified , all expressions with indices should be understood to hold for each value of the index . )    crucially , imposing membership in @xmath14 involves a finite number of linear matrix inequalities and positive - semidefinite constraints for the variables @xmath18 in , which are all valid constraints to formulate the problem as an sdp @xcite . by introducing the",
    "maximally mixed assemblage for bob , @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 denotes the number outcomes of a and @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the dimension of a s and b s respective systems , we arrive at the following sdp test for bipartite entanglement with one untrusted party : @xmath23 where @xmath13 is the assemblage observed by b in this network . since @xmath24",
    ", a sufficiently negative and large value of @xmath25 will always solve the second line of , and hence this sdp is strictly feasible .",
    "if we denote by @xmath26 the solution of for a fixed @xmath13 , then @xmath27 indicates that the decomposition can be found , and thus @xmath2 is separable . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath28 , some amount of identity noise has to be added to the assemblage to make it lhs , so we certify entanglement in @xmath2 .    furthermore , from the _ dual _ formulation of the _ primal _ problem , it is possible to define a set of operators @xmath29 , which are such that the linear functional : @xmath30 \\label{eq.witness1unt}\\ ] ] provides a strictly negative value only if @xmath31 demonstrates steering , certifying then the entanglement of @xmath2 . since the primal problem is strictly feasible , _ strong duality _",
    "holds , and the dual and primal solutions coincide @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 constitutes the desired witness for bipartite entanglement with one untrusted party .    to conclude this section , note that the witness we have constructed here certifies entanglement between a and b , whether c is holding a device that is trusted or untrusted . in other words",
    ", this witness also certifies the presence of entanglement accross the bipartitions a : bc and b : ac , for any level of trust that c might have on his measurement device .",
    "we now move on to the full tripartite network , for which we wish to certify the presence of entanglement in the whole state @xmath0 distributed to a , b and c. the construction procedure is similar to the one from the previous section .",
    "if @xmath0 is fully separable , then : @xmath34    we treat first the case in which only a uses an untrusted device , while b and c remain trusted ( see top - right of fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] ) . in this case ,",
    "b and c are provided with the assemblage : @xmath35 , \\label{eq.sigbcax}\\ ] ] which , after using , takes the form : @xmath36 a decomposition of @xmath37 of the form can readily be seen to be similar to the one in , with the only difference that now the bipartite states of b and c conditioned on @xmath5 and @xmath4 are separable .",
    "this last requirement ( separability ) can not , in general , be translated to a finite number of linear matrix inequalities and positive constraints as before , because the set of separable states has a complicated structure .",
    "however , separability can be relaxed to _ positivity under partial transposition _",
    "@xcite , which is now a valid sdp constraint -and equivalent to separability whenever the product of the dimensions of b and c satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , we define the relaxed set : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the partial transposition operation with respect to system b. in the same fashion as in sec .",
    "[ sec.redent ] , with the help of the maximally mixed assemblage for b and c , namely @xmath41 $ ] , we obtain the corresponding sdp test for tripartite entanglement with one untrusted party : @xmath42 here , again , duality theory allows one to retreive operators @xmath29 defining a new witness @xmath33 with the exact same strutcture as in , and such that @xmath43 guarantees that @xmath0 is tripartite entangled .",
    "finally , note that whenever @xmath44 , there exist entangled steerable states that remain undetected by our witness construction , since the set of unsteerable states does not coincide with @xmath45 in this case .",
    "but since @xmath45 does contain all separable states , a negative value of the witness guarantees that the state is , unequivocally , entangled .    in the case of two parties holding untrusted devices ( say a and b , as shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] ) , c observes the assemblage : @xmath46 , \\label{eq.sigcabxy}\\ ] ] which , after replacing @xmath0 with its separable form , gives : @xmath47 since @xmath48 arises from local measurements of a separable state it must be _ local _",
    "@xcite , and can therefore be written as a convex combination of products of determinstic strategies for a and b. thus , the relevant set of unnormalized assemblages for tripartite entanglement with two untrusted parties is : @xmath49 and since membership in @xmath50 involves valid sdp constraints , we obtain the corresponding sdp test : @xmath51 where @xmath52 $ ] is the maximally mixed assemblage for c. the set of dual variables @xmath53 of program enable the construction of the witness : @xmath54 , \\label{eq.witness2unt}\\ ] ] which provides a strictly negative value if and only if @xmath55 demonstrates steering .      in this section",
    "we move to the more delicate task of certifying genuine tripartite entanglement in the state @xmath0 shared by a , b and c. if @xmath0 is not genuinely tripartite entangled , it is biseparable and has the form : @xmath56 where @xmath10 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are unnormalised probability distributions . for the case of one party using an untrusted device ( top - right of fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] ) , using in leads to : @xmath59 the first summation term in has the same structure as the decomposition in , with the only difference that now @xmath60 may even be entangled .",
    "thus , the relevant set defined for this first decomposition term is : @xmath61 which clearly involves valid sdp constraints only .",
    "the second summation term in has two main features : _",
    "( i ) _ it does not demonstrate steering from a to b. this implies that tracing out c will leave b with an lhs assemblage with respect to a. _ ( ii ) _ it is separable across b : c .",
    "the first feature , having an lhs model , is readily translated to sdp constraints , as we have seen in the previous sections .",
    "the second one , separability , has to be relaxed to positivity under partial transposition , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec.fullent ] .",
    "thus , the relaxed set @xmath62 corresponding to the second decomposition term is given by : @xmath63   = \\sum_{\\mu } d_{\\mu}(a|x)\\sigma^{\\text{b}}_{\\mu},\\right .",

    "provides a witness @xmath33 , defined as in , such that @xmath65 certifies that @xmath0 is genuinely tripartite entangled .    for the case of two parties using untrusted devices ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig.fig1 ] ) , substituting in gives : @xmath66 the first summation term of the decomposition obtained in has only one main feature , that it may contain steering from b to c , but never from a to c. hence , it defines the set @xmath67 as : @xmath68 the second summation term appearing in has the same structure as the first one , and thus the set @xmath69 is straightforwardly defined in the same manner as @xmath67 in . the third term in , on the other hand , has two features : _",
    "( i ) _ it corresponds to an lhs assemblage , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the probability distribution @xmath48 is _ quantum _ , in the sense that it arises from local measurements performed on ( possibly entangled ) states @xmath70 .",
    "deciding if a probability distribution is quantum is not straightforward because the quantum set @xmath71 lacks of a precise characterization .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to construct a hierarchy @xmath72 of well characterized sdp relaxations of the set @xmath71 , the so - called navascus - pironio - acn ( npa ) hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the npa hierarchy , originally introduced for probability distributions , can be generalized to assemblages , in the sense that one can define the @xmath73-th relaxed set @xmath74 of assemblages for c encoding all the constraints on orthogonality and commutativity for the measurement operators of a and b ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "given the above , the relaxed set @xmath75 is : @xmath76 where we had to use the finite set of non - signalling strategies @xmath77 to decompose the quantum probability distribution @xmath48 in terms of a finite number of distributions @xcite ( deterministic strategies are insufficient here because of the existence of quantum correlations lying outside the local set ) .",
    "the sdp test for genuine tripartite entanglement with two untrusted parties is , therefore : @xmath78 and the corresponding semi - device independent witness @xmath33 is obtained from duality theory and has the same structure as .",
    "here we provide numerical values for the three - qubit w state @xmath79 and discuss the fact that parties a , b , and c can check for all kinds of entanglement without trusting the others , and certify one - sided randomness as well . in all that follows we consider that the measurements performed by all trusted boxes are pauli observables , namely , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "our theoretical findings are summarized in the second column of table  [ tab.1 ] .",
    "since the w state is symmetric , all reductions are equivalent regardless of the party that is discarded .",
    "specifically , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the two - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath85 .",
    "the reduced state turns out to be steerable with a theoretical violation of @xmath86 .",
    "this value is relatively small because of the detrimental contribution of the separable state @xmath87 .",
    "such violation not only guarantees the presence of entanglement in the reduced state , but it also certifies the presence of entanglement across any bipartition of the tripartite network , regardless of whether the third party ( the discarded one ) is using a trusted device or not , as explained in the first paragraph of sec .",
    "[ sec.scenarios ] .    for the tripartite w state",
    ", we observe the presence of entanglement and gme both in the `` one untrusted '' scenario and in the `` two untrusted '' scenario as well ( see lines 2 - 5 of table  [ tab.1 ] ) .",
    "note that the violations for the `` one untrusted '' scenario are always better than for the `` two untrusted '' scenario , because in the former case there is more useful information available ( about the state ) than in the latter case .",
    "the values for tripartite entanglement are also always better than the values obtained for gme , as the presence of the latter implies the presence of the former , but the converse is not true in general ; that is , a state might be entangled without being gme .",
    "to demonstrate the practical utility of the theoretical results presented in sections [ sec.witnesses ] and [ sec.theoretical ] , we produced a three - qubit w state using photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup .",

    "thus , the fact that any reduction of the w state is steerable but does not allow for one - sided randomness certification , may tentatively be refered to as _ one - sided bound randomness _ : a form of steerable correlations for which an eavesdropper can predict the result of any of the measurements performed on the untrusted side .      the scenario presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.fig2 ] turns out to be relevant and well suited for our experimental implementation of the photonic w state ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.experimental ] ) , as a physical bipartition of the state stems between the two photons produced . in this sense",
    ", it is natural to consider the photon encoding both polarization and path qubits as a single party , and analyze the amount of randomness of the outcomes @xmath109 retrieved when untrusted measurements are performed on such physical part of the system .",
    "first of all , we checked that the experimental data of each of the the reduced states does not reveal any amount of one - sided randomness , as predicted by the theory .",
    "subsequently , we managed to certify @xmath129 bits from the bipartitions of the w state .",
    "this value falls far from the theoretical value of @xmath130 bits .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that the amount of randomness is extremely sensitive to the visibility @xmath131 of the pure @xmath100 state with respect to white noise .",
    "for instance , we observe that for @xmath132 the number of one - sided random bits that can be certified is already less than unity .",
    "the obtained theoretical results are nevertheless encouraging for the near future , as sources with better visibilites should allow to certify higher and higher amounts of genuine random bits .",
    "in conclusion , we show that a recently introduced method for certification of entanglement when semi - device independent measurements realized in a quantum network can be successfully employed for the case where a w state is distributed .",
    "we study in detail the case of a tripartite configuration , even though the method is valid for larger networks .",
    "entanglement is witnessed for a few illustrative combinations of trusted and untrusted parties .",
    "we also present experimental results obtained with a proof of principle optical set - up .",
    "we observe good qualitative agreement between theory and experimental results , and verify the strong dependence of the witnessed entanglement on the degree of purity of the initial state .",
    "we further investigate the certification of genuine randomness .",
    "we observe that one - sided randomness can not be certified .",
    "however , considering bipartitions of the tripartite w state and the bipartition with two elements untrusted , it is possible in principle to certify up to 1.58 random bits . analyzing the experimental implementation ,",
    "only @xmath133 random bits were certified .",
    "this discrepancy between the expected and measured values emphasizes the critical dependence of the amount of random information certified on the purity of the initial state .",
    "our results promote the w state as a key candidate for the implementation of device semi independent protocols , where some of the parties use untrusted devices .",
