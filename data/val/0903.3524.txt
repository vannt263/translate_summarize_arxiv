    "to determine the topology of a given algebraic surface and to use triangular meshes to approximately represent the surface are fundamental operations in computer graphics and geometric modeling .",
    "meshing of surfaces could be used to display the surface correctly and to perform engineering applications on the surface , such as the finite element analysis . a survey on this topic",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider an implicit surface defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a square free polynomial with rational numbers as coefficients .",
    "there exists a large amount of work on meshing implicit surfaces",
    ". please see the work @xcite and the literatures cited in them .",
    "recent work focuses on isotopic meshing @xcite .",
    "simply speaking , a meshing is called * isotopic * if it has the same topology and the same geometry as the surface ( for definition see section 2 ) .",
    "a meshing is called * ambient isotopic * or * certified * if it is isotopic and approximates the surface to any give precision . there exist four main approaches to compute isotopic meshings for surfaces : the marching cube method , the morse theory method , the delaunay refinement method , and the cad ( cylindrical algebraic decomposition ) based method .",
    "the famous marching cube method repeatedly subdivides the space into smaller cubes until the structure of the surface inside each cube is known @xcite . for implicit surfaces ,",
    "snyder proposed the globally parameterizable criterion for that purpose @xcite .",
    "plantinga and vegter proposed the small normal variation condition which leads to a better meshing algorithm @xcite .",
    "hart et al proposed a method based on morse theory @xcite .",
    "the idea is to check when the topology of @xmath2 will change for a parameter @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 changes from some initial value where @xmath2 has no solution to @xmath4 , the topology of the surface is found .",
    "fortuna et al presented improved algorithms for surfaces in the projective space @xcite .    for a set of points on the surface",
    ", one can form the restricted delaunay triangles and the corresponding delaunay triangulation can be used to approximate the surface .",
    "boissonnat and oudot proved that when the sample point set satisfies certain conditions , the delaunay triangulation has the same topology as the surface @xcite .",
    "cheng et al established similar results using different strategies @xcite .",
    "the cad method proposed by collins can be used to divide the euclidean space into cylindrical cells such that the given surface has the same sign on each of the cells . then to determine the topology of the surface , we need only give the adjacency information between the cells @xcite . alone this line , new ideas are introduced to compute the topology of surfaces @xcite .",
    "all the above methods except the one based on cad work for surfaces without singularities only . in this paper",
    ", we give a method to compute a certified meshing for implicit algebraic surfaces with singularities .",
    "the method is a hybrid one based on the cad approach and the marching cube approach .",
    "we propose a cad based method to compute a certified meshing for the surface inside a box containing singularities and use a modified plantinga - vegter method to compute a certified meshing for the surface inside a box without singularities .",
    "our main contribution is how to treat the singularities .",
    "this paper consists of three parts .",
    "the algorithms for surfaces are the main contributions . in section 3",
    ", a new method is proposed to compute a certified meshing for a plane algebraic curve .",
    "this section also provides preparations for algorithms about surfaces .",
    "there exist many methods to compute the topology of plane curves , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our contribution is to give an interval based method to compute the adjacency information and to give an ambient isotopic meshing for a curve .",
    "the method in @xcite can also compute an ambient isotopic meshing based on root bounds of equation systems .",
    "our method is based on symbolic - numerical computation , which is practically more effective . in section 4",
    ", a new method is proposed to compute an isotopic meshing for a surface .",
    "the method has two advantages .",
    "first , we use symbolic computation methods to guarantee the completeness and whenever possible use interval arithmetics to increase the efficiency .",
    "actually , computations of algebraic numbers are totally avoided . the work @xcite uses algebraic numbers .",
    "second , our algorithm does not change the surface to generic positions as done in @xcite , which is generally expensive .",
    "our method need only to project the surface once , while the algorithm proposed in @xcite need to do projections twice .    in section 5 , a method is proposed to compute a certified meshing for a surface . a well - known technical to treat a singular point @xmath5",
    "is to find a * segregating box * which contains @xmath5 but does not intersect the surface at its bottom and top faces .",
    "we f extend this concept to singular curve segments and give an interval based method to compute such boxes and meshes in the boxes .",
    "another key ingredient is a careful analysis of the extremal points of surfaces and spatial curves .",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite , that the method in @xcite  makes no guarantees about the geometric accuracy of the mesh , and it can not be extended in a straightforward way to provide a more accurate mesh . \" to our knowledge , the method proposed in this paper is the first one to compute a certified meshing for surfaces with singularities .",
    "algorithms in sections 3 and 4 are implemented in maple and nontrivial examples are used to show that the algorithm is quite effective for surfaces with singular points and curves .",
    "in this section , we give several known results and algorithms needed in this paper . following @xcite",
    ", we will compute a meshing with correct topology for a curve or a surface in the following sense .",
