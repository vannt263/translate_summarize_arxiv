    "the anisotropic models occup an important place among various realistic models for study of the dynamical evolution of globular clusters . in frame of this models",
    "it have been work out the many evolution theories of the kinematics and dynamics of spherical self - gravitating systems ( e.g. , bettwieser & spurzem 1986 ; spurzem 1996 ; louis 1990 ; solanes & salvador - sole 1990 ; takahashi 1996 ) . at the same time",
    "have been accumlated many observational data .",
    "these data mostly concerned star counts and surface brightness profiles , proper motions , stellar radial velocity dispersion , etc .",
    "( meylan & heggie 1997 ) . despite of the presence such great quantity information ,",
    "still there are difficulties in comparision problem the observational data with results of numerical simulations in the frame work of anisotropic models .",
    "one of causes of this phenomenon perhaps is concluded in that for their performe we must have at least the value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are radial and tangential components of velocity dispersion respectively ( @xmath3 ) . in general case it depends on radial distance and time .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine the value of anisotropy parameter for 10 globular clusters , to try find out the its dependence on limiting magnitude and on radial distance .",
    "we have used the method that was proposed by agekian and petrovskaya ( 1962 ) .",
    "let us assume : 1 ) the star ensemble has an equal - mass spectrum ; 2 ) the cluster is spherically symmetric and is in stationary state in the regular force - field ; 3 ) the cluster consists of single stars ; 4 ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 along radius ( so @xmath6 ) .",
    "then the cluster is described by means of the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are undimensional radial distance and undimensional spatial density .",
    "a theoretical surface mass density profile is determined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are scale factors , @xmath13 is constant taking into account the infinity radius of the model and @xmath14 is the solution of ( 1 ) . from assumption 1 ) it follows that @xmath15 , where n is spatial number star density .",
    "then @xmath16 is theoretical surface number density of stars . here",
    "constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined by minimization of the function @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] where n is number of star counts zones and @xmath18 is observed surface number density of stars .",
    "that value of @xmath19 that gives minimum @xmath20 is adopted as most probable value of a.",
    "we determined the value of anisotropy parameter @xmath19 for following 10 globular clusters : m3 , m12 , m13 , m15 , m55 , m56 , palomar 3 , palomar 14 , ngc5139 ( @xmath21 cen ) and ngc6535 .",
    "the results are given in table 1 .",
    "for most clusters we have @xmath22 , i.e. they have almost isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "it is interesting that for all clusters theoretical number density profiles are in good agreement with observational ones .",
    "but the theoretical density profile in the halo almost in all cases is lower than observational one .",
    "perhaps the cause is in the assumption about equal - mass .",
    "the fact is , as a result of mass segregation the low - mass stars prevail in the halo and consequently we overestimated mass density in this region . in reality",
    "the mass density less than we suppose .",
    "for m56 at limiting magnitude @xmath23 we found @xmath24 .",
    "hence in this cluster the velocity distribution is strongly anisotropic yet .",
    "besides in order to find out an influence of limiting magnitude to value of @xmath19 , we calculated it at @xmath25 and found @xmath26 , i.e. if in this case the limiting magnitude decreases , then the anisotropy parameter decreases also .",
    "perhaps it is because , in first case ( @xmath23 ) it is expected the influence of low - mass stars to value of @xmath19 that generally are in halo and move along elongated orbits .    in order to find out the possible dependence of the anisotropy parameter on the radial distance we performed for ngc5139 ( @xmath21 cen ) additional calculations in three separate regions .",
    "the results show that in the central region @xmath22 , in middle region @xmath27 and in the halo @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the agreement of the theoretical and observational density profiles essentially was improved than one for whole cluster .",
