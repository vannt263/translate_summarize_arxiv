    "theoretical studies of t - j ladders have proven to be valuable for understanding hi-@xmath2 cuprate compounds . while containing certain features of the two - dimensional t - j model , the ladders are quasi - one - dimensional , which greatly simplifies the treatment of the problem .",
    "recently , cuprate compounds with ladder structures have been produced experimentally , and data on their electronic properties have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the ladder compounds may be used for verification of models and mechanisms of superconductivity proposed for layered cuprates .",
    "the experimental works are now complemented by numerical results on t - j and hubbard models @xcite .",
    "together with experimental results , they provide a good testing ground for any analytical treatment .",
    "the challenge of theoretically solving the t - j model on ladders arises from its strongly correlated nature . in the real ladder",
    "compounds the coupling is nearly isotropic , i.e. the interchain coupling parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are close to the intrachain coupling .",
    "thus , the problem does not have a small parameter and can not be treated by a standard perturbation theory .",
    "several works exist based on starting from uncoupled chains and then including interchain hopping and spin exchange as perturbations @xcite . while weak - coupling approach is the most consistent and controlled of the existing analytic methods , it is not completely reliable as the interchain coupling increases and approaches the single - chain bandwidth .",
    "we shall further comment on possible corrections to this treatment .    in the present paper",
    "we employ the @xmath0 slave - boson mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "although not a controlled approximation , we believe that it can correctly capture the low - energy physics of the systems with a spin gap . in the paper",
    "we specialize to two - leg ladders , but our treatment may be further extended to any even - leg ladders which are known to exhibit spin gap .",
    "the spin gap ensures that most of the fluctuations around the mean - field state are massive .",
    "the only massless fluctuation is the 1 + 1-dimensional abelian gauge field which can be explicitly included as a pair - binding potential .",
    "the general idea of slave - boson method is to represent the vacant sites ( holes ) by an auxiliary bosonic field , which allows us to rewrite the non - linear no - double - occupancy condition as a linear constraint in terms of fermions ( representing spin degrees of freedom ) and bosons ( representing charge degrees of freedom ) @xcite .",
    "introducing auxiliary bosons expands the hilbert space of states , and the system aquires an additional gauge symmetry .",
    "the mean - field ansatz breaks this symmetry , which is restored for physical correlation functions after averaging over all gauge - equivalent configurations .",
    "we use the @xmath0 version of the slave - boson construction developed earlier for the two - dimensional problem @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the auxiliary boson has two components ( we call the corresponding degree of freedom isospin ; it is distinct from the actual spin ) which describe holes in the two different ways : either as sites with no fermions or as sites doubly occupied by fermions .",
    "thus extended , the system has a @xmath0 gauge symmetry ( rotating isospin ) .",
    "we choose to use the @xmath0 formalism instead of @xmath5 version of the slave - boson method developed previously for two - dimensional t - j model @xcite .",
    "we note that both analytic and numerical works @xcite point to a bipolaron picture where the holes are bound in pairs .",
    "as we shall see , this picture naturally emerges out of the @xmath0 formulation as the confinement between two species of bosons , while the @xmath5 formalism fails to give the correct low - energy physics .",
    "we believe that the @xmath0 mean - field theory has an advantage at low doping where it generalizes the @xmath0 symmetry of t - j model at half - filling @xcite .",
    "a discussion of relation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 approaches may be found in @xcite .",
    "we find that the low - temperature mean - field phase is the staggered - flux phase ( similar to that found for the two - dimensional problem in @xcite ) .",
    "the fluctuations about this mean - field state are described by gauge fields which have a gap , except for the in - phase fluctuations which form a 1 + 1-dimensional abelian gauge field . as a result",
    ", we find that the low - energy effective theory consists of two degenerate bands of holons with a short - range interaction and coupled to a @xmath5 gauge - field .",
    "the dynamics of this gauge field arises from its interactions with spinons .",
    "spinons have a gap and , therefore , give a nonsingular dynamics to the gauge field with the energy scale @xmath4 .",
    "the two bands of holons have opposite charges with respect to this gauge field and , therefore , form confined pairs .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the resulting theory for the hole excitations is the luther - emery liquid of hole pairs .",
    "this agrees with the bipolaronic picture of charge excitations proposed earlier both analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "it is known that the luther - emery liquid has two competing orders : superconducting singlet pairing ( ss ) and charge density wave ( cdw ) @xcite .",
    "we point out the necessity to distinguish between the hole density ( two - particle operator ) and the pair density ( four - particle operator ) .",
    "while the product of the correlation exponents for the ss and cdw order parameters is equal to one when cdw is understood as hole - density correlations , this relation does not necessarily hold for four - particle pair - density correlations .",
    "the relation between the single - hole and pair cdw exponents depends on the degree of the overlap of the bipolaronic pairs . at low density of holes ,",
    "when the pairs do not overlap , these two exponents coincide . on the other hand , in the limit of highly overlapping pairs",
    "we find that the effective exponents may differ by 2 .",
    "this possibly explains the unexpected numerical results for the correlation exponents obtained by noack et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "further , we discuss the possible implication of our model for the superconducting transition via pair condensation ( of course , interladder correlations would be necessary ) .",
    "we describe the superconducting order by the nearest - neighbor order parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we extend our discussion for a more general case of a weakly doped antiferromagnet on a bi - partite lattice with a spin gap .",
    "this class of systems includes all even - leg ladders as a particular case .",
    "we assume that at low temperature such a system is in the staggered flux phase , which results in two degenerate interacting holonic bands . under these assupmtions",
    "we find that the order parameter obeys the modified d - wave relation : @xmath7 where the sum is performed over all nearest neighbors of a site @xmath8 .",
    "this relation holds in the limit of zero doping , with corrections involving the hole concentration .",
    "this relation was first derived by s.  c.  zhang as an exact result for the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "our derivation should be understood as a verification that the @xmath0 mean - field approximation preserves this exact property . when specialized to the case of the two - leg ladder with isotropic coupling , the above equation becomes @xmath9 .",
    "this agrees very well with the earlier numerical results @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in three sections . in the first section ,",
    "we review the @xmath0 slave - boson method and present the results of the mean - field theory computations . in the second section",
    "we discuss the effective theory for the holons and the correlation exponents for ss and cdw pairing .",
    "finally , the third part is devoted to the discussion of the modified d - wave relation for the superconducting order parameter .",
    "in this section we present the @xmath0 mean - field theory for the t - j hamiltonian @xmath10 on the ladder ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .    the sum is performed over nearest - neighbor site pairs @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electron creation and annihilation operators on site @xmath8 ( @xmath14 is the spin index ) , @xmath15 is the electron spin , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the occupation nuber of the site @xmath8 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is the projector onto the no - double - occupancy states ( with @xmath20 for any @xmath8 ) . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the parameters of the hamiltonian . in the real ladder compounds @xmath3 and @xmath4 are estimated to be about 4000k and 1300k respectively @xcite . in what follows we assume that the interchain and the intrachain couplings are equal ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and as a realistic approximation we take @xmath23 .    following the usual procedure of the @xmath0 slave - boson method @xcite , we introduce two fermionic and one bosonic isospin doublets on each site : @xmath24 with the electronic operators written in terms of bosons @xmath25 and fermions @xmath26 as @xmath27 the resulting hilbert space is larger than that of the original t - j system . to select the subspace of physical states ( which is invariant under the hamiltonian of the original system ) we impose a linear constraint ( replacing the non - linear no - double - occupancy constraint ) : @xmath28 ( @xmath29 are identical to the pauli matrices @xmath30 , but they act in the isospin space , and we denote them by a different letter to distinguish from the pauli matrices @xmath30 acting on true spin ) . on a given site ,",
    "this constraint allows only three states : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , which correspond to spin up , spin down electrons and a vacancy respectively .",
    "thus in the @xmath0 formulation , a vacancy may be represented by both two - spinon and no - spinon states corresponding to different isospins of the holon @xmath25 .",
    "thus formulated , the extended system is invariant under an @xmath0 gauge symmetry : @xmath34 this gauge symmetry acts on the isospin of fermions and bosons , and mixes creation operators @xmath35 with the annihilation operators of opposite spin @xmath36 .    introducing the nearest - neighbor mean - field parameters @xmath37 with @xmath38 and",

    "\\label{2.8}\\ ] ]    in the present paper we use combinatoric coefficients in ( [ 2.8 ] ) different from those used in @xcite .",
    "our choice of coefficients in ( [ 2.8 ] ) gives the correct combinatoric factors for tadpole diagrams , and they differ from those obtained from the hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "this ambiguity in the numeric factors of order one is of no practical significance , since it falls within the uncertainty of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ 2.8 ] ) is accurate only up to four - boson terms which we neglect in the usual way @xcite .",
    "the four - boson terms give rise to only short - range interactions between holons and can be omitted at this level of approximation .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the non - zero values of @xmath39 correspond to bose condensation .",
    "we do not expect bose condensation in a quasi - one - dimensional system and set mean - field value @xmath42 .",
    "this implies that we in fact release the no - double - occupancy constraint ( it is satisfied only on average ) .",
    "afterwards , the constraint may be imposed by including the fluctuations of the field @xmath39 .    introducing the chemical potential @xmath43 , we arrive at the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath44 -\\mu\\sum_i(h_i^\\dagger h_i -\\delta ) , \\label{2.9}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the concentration of holes ( doping ) .",

    "the mean - field solution breaks this gauge symmetry . only gauge invariant quantitites correspond to physical observables .",
    "any non - gauge - invariant expression will vanish after averaging over all gauge - equivalent configurations of @xmath46 .",
    "now we turn to describing possible phases .",
    "phases should be parametrized by gauge - invariant functions of @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the translational symmetry is unbroken , i.e. a translation of the mean - field solution @xmath56 along the ladder transforms it to a gauge equivalent configuration .",
    "we also assume that the symmetry of reflection about the ladder axis ( interchanging the two legs ) is also preserved in the mean - field solution . under these assumptions all possible phases",
    "may be parametrized by four real parameters : the two amplitudes @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( intrachain and interchain respectively ) , and two @xmath0 order parameters : @xmath59 @xmath60 with the products taken along the contours @xmath61 and @xmath62 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( the first product contains four matrices , the second one  eight matrices ) .",
    "the meaning of the order parameter @xmath63 is analogous to the cosine of the flux through plaquet in the @xmath5 formulation @xcite . to explain this analogy we may introduce the @xmath0 flux @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 where the product starts and ends at a site @xmath66 of the contour @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . then @xmath67 ( obviously , the direction of the vector @xmath64 depends on the choice of the starting point @xmath66 , but its magnitude @xmath68 does not ) .    the order parameter @xmath69 measures the relative orientation of neighboring @xmath0 fluxes .",
    "namely , define the two fluxes @xmath70 and @xmath71 through neighboring plaquets with a common starting point @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath72 then we see that for any @xmath49 the order parameters @xmath63 and @xmath69 are restricted to @xmath73 @xmath74 thus , the @xmath0 order may be represented by a point in a two - dimensional domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) with the two corners representing the @xmath75-flux and the urvb phases , the boundaries corresponding to the uniform flux ( uf ) and staggered flux ( sf ) phases analogous to their @xmath5 counterparts @xcite , but preserving translational and time - reversal symmetries . in the uf phase",
    "the neighboring @xmath0 fluxes are parallel , in the sf phase they are antiparallel , and inside the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] they form angles ranging between 0 and @xmath75 .    by numerically minimizing the free energy ( [ 2.11 ] ) ( at @xmath23 )",
    "we find the following mean - field phase diagram in the @xmath76 coordinates :    where    1 .",
    "@xmath77 denotes the high - temperature free spin phase ( @xmath78 ) ; 2 .",
    "urvb is the phase with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( so that @xmath82 ) ; 3 .",
    "d is the dimer phase : @xmath80 , @xmath83 ; 4 .",
    "sf is the staggered - flux phase with @xmath80 , @xmath79 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "numerically we find that the transition between d and sf phases is a very soft first - order transition .",
    "in fact , the dimer phase d has flat spectra for bosons and fermions and will be destroyed by the fluctuations ( correlations along the ladder will appear ) .",
    "we shall disregard the dimer phase as an artifact of the mean - field approximation and for the rest of the paper we restrict our discussion to the sf phase .    the sf phase may be described by different gauge - equivalent configurations of @xmath46 .",
    "one of the _ translationally invariant _ configurations ( analogous to d - wave pairing phase in the @xmath5 mean - field theory @xcite ) is ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) : @xmath86 or , equivalently , @xmath87    further , we shall use a different , the so called `` abelian '' parametrization with @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) which corresponds to @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of the rung .",
    "this gauge fixing is not translationally invariant , but instead it has the property that all @xmath46 commute .",
    "this choice of gauge resembles the staggered - flux @xmath5 phase @xcite . in the u(1 ) formalism , the staggered - flux and d - wave pairing phases are different , but their @xmath0 counterparts are gauge - equivalent @xcite .    in the @xmath0 mean - field theory bosonic and fermionic",
    "spectra are proportional to each other ( with the scales @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) . in the sf phase",
    "we obtain the spectrum @xmath91 ( @xmath92 $ ] is the wave vector ) and each of these two bands is doubly degenerate ( four bands total ) .",
    "we remark that labeling the states by wave vectors @xmath93 may depend on the gauge , but , because gauge - dependent shift of @xmath93 involves equally bosons and fermions , the gauge - invariant quantities remain unchanged .",
    "the double degeneracy of states is a characteristic feature of the staggered - flux phase .",
    "it is due to the fact that a certain non - abelian subgroup of the full symmetry group of the extended hamiltonian remains unbroken by the mean - field ansatz . in the staggered - flux phase the order parameters @xmath46",
    "are invariant under a u(1 ) subgroup of global isospin rotations ( in the abelian gauge ( [ 2.21 ] )  ( [ 2.22 ] ) these are simply global rotations by @xmath94 ) .",
    "besides , there remains a particular symmetry of @xmath46 , which is the combination of time reversal ( transforming @xmath95 ) and global isospin rotation ( exchanging isospins up and down in the abelian gauge ) .",
    "this symmetry operation does not commute with the @xmath5 rotation , but extends them to a nonabelian group .",
    "the two degenerate bands form a two - dimensional representation of this group , with time reversal mapping one band onto the other .",
    "the typical numerical values for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath96 are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( fonud by minimizing free energy at @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this means that the upper bands of the spectrum are separated from the lower bands by a gap of order @xmath4 for fermions and of order @xmath3 for bosons ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "the fermionic spectrum is half - filled , i.e. the lower bands are completely filled whereas the upper bands are empty .",
    "the fermionic excitations have a gap of order of @xmath4 .",
    "this agrees with the prediction of spin gap in two - leg ladders and is crucial for the stability of the phase .    finally , we need to include the fluctuations about the mean - field phase .",
    "these fluctuations are described by the spatial @xmath0 gauge fields @xmath102 defined on the links and their temporal counterparts @xmath103 defined on the sites @xcite .",
    "the temporal components of the gauge field @xmath104 coincide with the constraint - fixing lagrange multipliers in ( [ 2.8 ] ) when expressed in units of @xmath4 .",
    "the effective action for the fields @xmath105 and @xmath104 is invariant under the ( time - dependent ) gauge transformations @xmath106 for arbitrary @xmath0 matrices @xmath107 defined on sites .    in the sf phase the @xmath0 gauge symmetry",
    "is broken down to u(1 ) global symmetry . in the abelian gauge , this residual symmetry is realized by rotations by @xmath94 .",
    "as shown in the appendix b of @xcite , the free energy will contain terms proportional to @xmath108 , where the products are taken along closed loops on the lattice . when expanded in gauge - field fluctuations ,",
    "these terms give rise to mass for the gauge modes proportional to @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus , massless modes of the gauge field must be proportional to @xmath94 @xcite , and we may treat @xmath105 and @xmath104 as @xmath5 gauge fields .    to proceed further ,",
    "we may make use of the symmetry ( [ 2.24 ] ) ( now an @xmath5 gauge symmetry with all @xmath107 being rotations by @xmath94 ) .",
    "the analysis appears to be particularly simple in the gauge where @xmath111 across the rungs ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) .    then the remaining gauge fields split into the in - phase and out - of - phase modes @xmath112 ( where the superscripts @xmath113 and @xmath114 label the two legs of the ladder ) .",
    "the dynamics of the gauge fields arises from their coupling to the spinons and can be found by computing the polarization diagram ( fig .  [ fig:9 ] ) ,",
    "solid lines denote spinons ) :    in contrast to the two - dimensional model , where there exist massless transverse fluctuations of the gauge field , it is not the case in the ladder .",
    "the ladder geometry restricts the transverse wavevector to two values @xmath115 and @xmath116 which correspond to the modes @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "the out - of - phase modes @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( describing the fluctuations of the flux @xmath121 through the plaquet ) acquire a finite mass of order @xmath4 and , therefore , can be neglected , giving only a short - range interactions between holons .",
    "on the other hand , the modes @xmath122 and @xmath123 become 1 + 1 qed gauge fields with the long - wavelength action @xmath124 with @xmath125 of order @xmath4 .",
    "this action arises from expanding the polarization diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "the particular value of @xmath125 depends on the values of mean - field parameters , and for the typical values cited above differs from @xmath4 only by a factor of order unity .",
    "since the two lower bosonic bands have different isospin , they have opposite charges with respect to the gauge field @xmath117 . in 1 + 1",
    "dimension , electromagnetic field leads to a confining ( linearly growing with the distance ) potential between charges : @xmath126 in the limit of low hole density , the bosons will form isospin - neutral dipole pairs ( bipolarons ) which produce no field outside each pair . therefore , bipolarons will interact only by short - range forces .",
    "we may estimate the size of bipolaron by solving a simple quantum - mechanical problem of two particles interacting via the potential ( [ 2.27 ] ) .",
    "the holon hopping amplitude is of order @xmath3 , therefore the kinetic energy of bipolaron is of order @xmath127 .",
    "the potential energy , on the other hand , is of order @xmath128 .",
    "thus from variational principle we find that the size of bipolaron is @xmath129 up to a factor of order one . for our assumption",
    "@xmath23 , this gives @xmath130 , which means that now the other short - range ( repulsive ) terms , which we omitted before , give a comparable contribution . due to the no - double - occupancy constraint , the two species of bosons must be subject to a substantial on - site repulsion .",
    "it increases the estimated size of the pair by several lattice spacings , but does not change the long - range attractive force . since we omitted the short - range part of the interaction from the very beginning , we can not compute the size of the pair more precisely . from the numerics",
    "@xcite we know that the characteristic decay length for the pairing correlation function is about four lattice spacings , in agreement with our discussion",
    ".    a simple classical explanation of the confinement may be obtained from the picture of fluctuating singlet bonds ( somewhat in the spirit of @xcite ) .",
    "we may think of the spin structure of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ladder as of spins forming fluctuating singlet bonds with nearest neighbors ( fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "once we have a single hole , it leads to the appearance of a localized spin , which costs a finite energy of order @xmath4 .",
    "when putting two holes , the spins between the holes must form singlet bonds in a non - favorable way without a freedom to fluctuate ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "naturally , this string of singlets costs certain energy @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the distance between the holes and @xmath125 is of order @xmath4 .",
    "we believe that this naive picture gives a correct understanding of the holon confinement which we derived starting from the mean - field sf phase .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the low - energy excitations in our model are pairs of holons  bipolarons  which are bound by long - range confining interaction .",
    "due to complete screening of the confining interaction by a single particle in one dimension , bipolarons interact only via short - range forces , and this recovers the picture of luther - emery liquid of hole pairs proposed earlier in @xcite .",
    "in fact , this simple picture is valid at low hole concentration @xmath133 , when bipolarons do not overlap .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show that as overlap increases , the charge - density - wave exponents for single - particle and for pair densities may differ .    for quantitative description of bipolarons",
    "we introduce the three different correlation exponents as follows .",
    "let @xmath134 be the fluctuation of the number of holes on the rung ( @xmath135 is the coordinate along the ladder , superscripts refer to the two chains ) .",
    "let further @xmath136 be the fluctuation of the probability that both sites of the same rung contain holes .",
    "finally , let @xmath137 be the singlet superconducting order parameter on the rung at the position @xmath135 . then define the correlation exponents @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 by @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the coefficient at @xmath145 $ ] in the expansion of the correlation function @xcite : @xmath146 + \\nonumber\\\\ + a_2 |x - y|^{-\\theta_2 }   \\cos[4k_f(x - y ) ] + \\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlation function ( [ 3.1 ] ) describes charge - density - wave ( cdw ) ordering , and the correlation function ( [ 3.3 ] )  singlet superconductivity ( ss ) ordering .    by @xmath147",

    "bipolarons interact repulsively and , from a naive classical picture , it is likely that the repulsion is nearly hard - core . in this limit @xmath153 , because on the bipolaronic subspace of the total hilbert space the matrix elements of the operators @xmath154 and @xmath155 differ only by a numerical factor ( the probability of the two holons in the pair to occupy the same rung ) . for hard - core repulsion @xmath156 , since hard - core bosons can be mapped to free fermions by a jordan - wigner - type transformation , so that density - density correlations coincide with those of free fermions . from the theory of luther - emery liquid it is known that cdw and ss correlations are described by dual phases , and the corresponding exponents are therefore reciprocal : @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the luther - emery theory of bipolaronic excitations may be found in @xcite .",
    "the opposite limit of highly overlapping bipolarons is more subtle . in this limit ( @xmath158 ) bipolarons can exchange particles .",
    "exchanging a particle would cost interaction energy of order @xmath159 , while the gain of kinetic energy would be of order @xmath160 .",
    "thus , in this limit we can not speak of isolated bipolarons , but rather of two species of bosons with attraction much smaller than the bandwidth .",

    "as it was pointed out by haldane @xcite , in general one must also include higher - order terms in the density expansion ( [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "these terms proportional to @xmath184 $ ] with @xmath185 are absent in the free fermion theory ( and , consequently , in hard - core boson theory ) , but arise as we include interactions mixing left- and right - moving excitations .",
    "they produce terms proportional to @xmath186 $ ] in the @xmath187 expansion , and give a contribution to @xmath188 decaying with the exponent @xmath138 instead of @xmath189 .",
    "this effect that originally higher - order terms result in leading correlation exponents is not paradoxical in view of the crossover to the dilute limit where the binding interaction is strong and the higher - order corrections to ( [ 3.9 ] ) play a dominating role .",
    "we suggest that the crossover from @xmath190 in the dilute limit to @xmath178 in the weak - coupling limitis governed by the overlap of bipolarons .",
    "namely , @xmath191 with relative weights of @xmath66 and @xmath192 depending on the average pair overlap ( @xmath193 at @xmath194 and @xmath195 at @xmath196 ) . the actual behavior of the coefficients @xmath66 and",
    "@xmath192 strongly depends on the short - scale features of the interaction , and can not be found in our rude treatment .",
    "the whole discussion of this section is equally applicable to the negative - u ( attractive ) hubbard model . in the low - density ( or large @xmath152 ) limit the exponents @xmath138 and @xmath139 coincide , while in the small @xmath197 limit we expect a crossover ( [ crossover ] ) to @xmath178 .",
    "in other words , because of screening , the long - range gauge interaction between holons in one dimension leads to the same behavior at large distances as a short - range attraction .    finally , we comment on our disagreement with the prediction of nagaosa @xcite that the correlations @xmath188 decay exponentially ( note again that @xmath149 in our notation corresponds to @xmath150 in the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "the disagreement my be explained from the fact that nagaosa starts from two uncoupled chains and treats the interchain couplings ( @xmath198 and @xmath199 ) as perturbations . in that picture ,",
    "power - law correlations @xmath188 will appear as a correction for the nonlinearity of the spectrum as the coupling increases and approaches the bandwidth .",
    "in contrast to the weak - coupling approach , our model starts directly from diagonalizing a strong - coupling hamiltonian ( [ 2.9 ] ) , and the correlations ( [ 3.1 ] ) are present from the very beginning .",
    "in this section we verify that our approximation scheme is consistent with the exact relation for the superconducting order parameter derived by s.  c.  zhang for the hubbard model @xcite ( and later translated to t - j model in @xcite ) .",
    "let us define the pairing operator @xmath200 and consider the quantity @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 are the ground states with zero and two holes respectively .",
    "should a superconducting transition happen , @xmath204 will become the superconducting order parameter .    from now on , we restrict @xmath8 and @xmath205 to be nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "zhang s results states that on a bipartite lattice in the limit of zero doping @xmath204 obey the relation @xmath206 where the sum is over the nearest neighbors of the site @xmath8 .",
    "on the two - dimensional square lattice this implies the d - wave symmetry of pairing ; thus we may call eq.([4.3 ] ) the modified d - wave relation .",
    "below we rederive this result within the @xmath0 slave - boson mean - field approximation . for the sake of generality ,",
    "we extend our further discussion to the t - j model on an arbitrary quasi - one - dimensional bi - partite lattice , provided it exhibits a spin gap ( the most popular examples of this type are even - leg ladders ) .",
    "further , assume that the low - temperature mean - field phase is analogous to the sf phase of the two - leg ladder .",
    "namely , we require that the @xmath0 order parameter may be brought to the diagonal form ( by a suitable choice of gauge ) : @xmath207 this requirement means that spinons and holons form doubly degenerate bands related by the symmetry of simultaneous time - reversal and isospin flip .",
    "in such a phase a superconductivity may evolve by pair formation between the holons at the bottom of the two lowest bands ( of course , superconductivity is possible only when stabilized by inter - ladder interactions , see e.g. @xcite ) .    for simplicity , let the coupling be isotropic ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the same on all links ) , as it was assumed in the previous sections . at the end of this section",
    "we shall extend the result to non - isotropic coupling .    using our slave - boson representation",
    ", we express @xmath6 ( for nearest - neigbor @xmath8 and @xmath205 ) in terms of spinons and holons as @xmath208.\\ ] ] at low doping , the fermionic part of the correlation function ( 4.2 ) may be replaced by the mean - field order parameters @xmath209 and we find @xmath210 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 now denote the states in the holonic sector .",
    "let @xmath211 and @xmath212 be the operators destroying holons at a wave vector @xmath93 in the two lowest bands ( subscripts denote the isospin ) .",
    "then the single - pair wave - function @xmath203 has the form @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the relative wave function of the two holons in a pair .",
    "eq.([4.7 ] ) becomes @xmath215 where @xmath216 since @xmath211 and @xmath212 are related by the time - reversal symmetry ( accompanied by a gauge transformation ) , @xmath217 , and for nearest - neghbor sites @xmath8 and @xmath205 @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a single - holon plane wave created by @xmath220 .",
    "the state @xmath219 is an eigenvector of the free hamiltonian proportional to the bosonic part of eq.([2.9 ] ) @xmath221 ( with the sum performed over nearest - neighbor pairs of sites )",
    ". therefore @xmath222    site @xmath8 .",
    "this immediately implies the result ( [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "the above derivation holds also at a non - zero temperature ( with ground - state expectation values replaced by thermal averages ) .",
    "however , it is strictly limited to zero doping : at finite doping eq.([4.6 ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "a remarkable feature of the relation ( [ 4.3 ] ) is its independence of the coupling parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for the two - leg ladder the modified d - wave relation ( [ 4.3 ] ) turns into @xmath223 this result agrees with the available numerical results @xcite .",
    "it would provide a good test for possible numerical models on ladders with a higher number of legs .",
    "the d - wave relation ( [ 4.3 ] ) may be easily extended to a non - isotropic coupling .",
    "in fact , the whole slave boson mean - field theory may be rederived for arbitrary coupling constants @xmath224 and @xmath225 , differing at different links .",
    "one just needs to replace @xmath3 and @xmath4 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] )  ( [ 2.9 ] ) by @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the whole argument of this section may be repeated downto eq.([4.12 ] ) which we must now replace by the hamiltonian @xmath226 finally , this leads to the following generalization of the d - wave relation ( [ 4.3 ] ) : @xmath227 this equation implies that as the hopping on a link increases , the weight of the superconducting oreder parameter on this link decreases .",
    "of course , eq.([4.16 ] ) may also be derived exactly for the hubbard model ( with the site- and link - dependent @xmath197 and @xmath3 ) by the method of @xcite .",
    "we presented the low - energy effective theory for charge excitations in two - leg t - j ladder , based on the mean - field treatment of spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 slave - boson formalism predicts bipolaronic picture of charge excitations , as expected from earlier analytic and numerical works . while capturing well the low - energy physics ,",
    "our approximation is not reliable for spin and single - electron excitations which have a gap of order @xmath4 . in the framework of the model developed in the paper , single - hole excitations",
    "may be constructed as holon - spinon pairs bound by confining gauge - field interaction .",
    "the similarity of the boson - fermion spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] to the single - hole spectrum found numerically in @xcite makes this possibility very appealing .",
    "however , spin structure of the ladder was included in the lowest mean - field order , and to restore correctly spin excitations requires a more elaborate treatment .",
