    "a vast body of work has been devoted to understanding the transition to decoherence in models of a two - level - system ( tls ) coupled to an infinite set of environmental degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the central quantity in this transition is the dynamical correlation function , or equivalently , the linear susceptibility , @xmath1 , of the system degrees of freedom . to our knowledge , no studies of the nonlinear susceptibility have been undertaken .",
    "our interest in the nonlinear response is twofold : 1 ) experimental probes of macroscopic quantum coherence ( mqc ) might access the nonlinear regime and 2 ) the nonlinear susceptibility appears to bear a different relationship to the coherence of the tls than the linear susceptibility .",
    "a measure of coherence of the system is the quantity of spectral weight within the resonance peak of @xmath1 associated with the tls  this is simply proportional to the probability of absorbing a _ single _ photon .",
    "absorption of a photon at a precise energy is a property uniquely associated with the underlying coherence of the quantum mechanical system . as the coupling to the environment",
    "is increased and the system increasingly localizes in one state , the probability of single photon absorption diminishes . in this paper",
    "we address whether _ two photon _ absorption is qualitatively similar  is it similarly linked to the underlying coherence of the system ? we are thus led to the study of nonlinear susceptibilities of a tls as the system is tuned through a decoherence transition .",
    "n. d. mermin investigated a model obtained from the well known spin - boson hamiltonian by keeping only the lowest two levels of each harmonic oscillator comprising the environmental bath @xcite .",
    "the therefore contains a `` system '' spin-1/2 , represented by the pauli matrices @xmath2 , coupled to a set of @xmath3 `` environment '' spin-1/2 degrees of freedom , @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian [ ham ] h= _ x + _ z _ j=1^n(s_j^+ + s_j^- ) + _ j=1^ns_j^z ( henceforth referred to as the mermin model ) can be solved to demonstrate the close correspondence between decoherence and a second order phase transition .",
    "the transition in the mermin model also bears some similarity to the decoherence transition in the ohmic case of the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite . owing to its finite hilbert space , exact dynamical susceptibilities ( linear and nonlinear )",
    "can be calculated and followed through the transition .",
    "the finite dimensionality may also be realistic in some physical settings and exhibits the expected corrections to an `` infinite environment '' thermodynamic phase transition . in this paper",
    ", we will present such calculations and a careful study of the mermin model at the linear level , demonstrating an analogy to the superconducting transition in the `` dirty '' limit .",
    "we will then go on to the calculation and interpretation of the third order , nonlinear corresponding to two photon absorption .    to briefly summarize our findings : the transition to decoherence",
    "is induced by strong coupling to environmental degrees of freedom ( large @xmath5 ) or a small system energy scale ( small @xmath6 ) . below a critical coupling , @xmath7 , all spectral weight of the dynamical [ imchi ] _",

    ". this feature corresponds to tunneling modified by a franck - condon type overlap factor .",
    "as the coupling is increased , spectral weight is continuously shifted to the `` near - zero '' frequency channel .",
    "the weight of the delta - function , @xmath11 , is simply the order parameter , @xmath12 ( or , more exactly , @xmath13 , for large but finite @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the dynamical obeys a sum rule implying that an incompletely formed broken symmetry state leaves some spectral weight at the position of the principal resonance , set by @xmath6 .",
    "it is in this respect that the mermin model differs from the ohmic case of the spin - boson hamiltonian ( sbh ) . in the sbh , the toulouse limit ( at @xmath14 )",
    ", corresponding to complete inelastic broadening of the resonance , is a precursor to localization of the system spin ( at @xmath15 ) @xcite . in the mermin model , the quantum resonance of the system spin  although damped",
    " remains intact through the decoherence transition .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the glover - tinkham - ferrell @xcite sum rule for the dynamical conductivity in superconductors .",
    "spectral weight falling in the gap region , proportional to the superfluid density ( or , equivalently , the order parameter ) is redistributed to a delta - function at zero frequency . in the case of the transition to decoherence ,",
    "finite but supercritical coupling , @xmath16 , is analogous to the transition to superconductivity in the dirty limit where the superconductor can absorb energy above the gap .",
    "in contrast , the nonlinear response has a more complicated behavior .",
    "two photon absorption ( tpa ) requires the presence of ancillary levels as intermediate states and is therefore enhanced when there is some degree of `` inelastic '' broadening of the primary resonance .",
    "at the two extremes , tpa is zero when @xmath17 and the environment is decoupled from the system  but it is also zero when @xmath18 and the system is completely decoherent .",
    "we now turn to a review of the analytical results obtained from the mermin model .",
    "in the absence of coupling to the environment , the two level system in ( [ ham ] ) possesses a ground state in a coherent superposition of spin up and spin down ( denoted @xmath19 ) and will display a sharp resonance in @xmath1 at @xmath20 .",
    "when environmental coupling is included , there are two effects commonly associated with decoherence .",
    "first , the coherence features should shift to lower frequency ( franck - condon overlap ) and secondly , the peak should broaden from `` inelastic '' energy exchange with the environment .",
    "these two effects are nicely demonstrated in the mermin model . in ( [ ham ] ) , the environment spins may be summed to one big @xmath21 spin , @xmath22 , and the becomes [ ham2 ] h= _ x + _ z s_x + s_z as mermin points out , the advantage of the ( [ ham2 ] ) is that in the limit @xmath23 , the environment spins may be replaced in the by the @xmath24 and @xmath25 components of a classical spin angular momentum : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the resulting hamiltonian [ ham3 ] h = _ x + _ z - may be diagonalized and its ground state eigenvalue , @xmath28 , given by e_0 ( ) = - - minimized with respect to @xmath29 .",

    "the environment and the system spins are frozen in two distinct orientations with degenerate energies .",
    "the ground state wave function is still in a superposition @xmath34 but it is no longer an evenly weighted one ( @xmath35 ) ; rather , the two roots correspond to the system predominantly in @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "however , for finite ( even very large ) @xmath3 , the system must be in an evenly weighted superposition  independent of the value of @xmath6 . for @xmath38 , it is possible to estimate the tunnel splitting between the ground and first excited states .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the adiabatic environment ( or small @xmath6 ) limit in which the environment instantaneously adjusts to the localization of the system in a given state and thus `` points '' at the angle @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for the system to jump to the other state , the environment must be caught in a fluctuation which points along the other direction , @xmath40 . the amplitude for @xmath3 spin-1/2 s to be found at an angle @xmath41 away is @xmath42 .",

    "although , for finite @xmath3 and @xmath6 , the symmetry is unbroken and the ground state is an evenly weighted superposition , there must be some symptom of the crisis at @xmath44 when @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "presumably , this symptom should be the inelastic broadening of the resonance to an over damped state .",
    "following along the lines of the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) calculation in @xcite , we treat the last two terms of ( [ ham2 ] ) as the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath45 .",

    "<S> the linear and nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities of a two level system are calculated as it undergoes a transition to a decoherent state . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the glover - tinkham - ferrell sum rule of superconductivity , spectral weight in the linear susceptibility is continuously transferred from a finite frequency resonance to nearly zero frequency , corresponding to a broken symmetry in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the behavior of the present model ( the mermin model ) differs significantly from the spin - boson model . </S>",
    "<S> the third order nonlinear susceptibility , corresponding to two - photon absorption , has an unexpected non - monotonic behavior as a function of the environmental coupling , reaching a maximum within the decoherent phase of the model . </S>",
    "<S> both linear and nonlinear susceptibilities may be expressed in a universal form .    </S>",
