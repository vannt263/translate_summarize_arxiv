    "cheng et al . ( 1996 ) reported similarities between particular statistical properties of a sample of 111 sgr 1806 - 20 bursts ( observed with the international cometary explorer , ice , between 1979 and 1984 ) and earthquakes .",
    "they noted that the distribution of the event energies of both phenomena follow a power law , dn @xmath3 e@xmath4  de , with index , @xmath5 @xmath0 1.6 .",
    "furthermore , they found that the cumulative waiting times between successive sgr bursts and earthquakes are similar .",

    "( 1987 ) noted that the distribution of waiting times between successive sgr 1806 - 20 bursts follow a lognormal function , which was also seen between micro - glitches of the vela pulsar ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) . using the same data set , palmer ( 1999 ) showed that , similar to earthquakes , some sgr 1806 - 20 bursts may originate from relaxation systems .",
    "g et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied a set of 1024 bursts from sgr 1900 + 14 ; 187 bursts were detected with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) aboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) and 837 bursts were detected with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) during an active period of the source in 1998 .",
    "we found that their fluence distribution is consistent with a power law of index @xmath5 = 1.66 over 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "the distribution of waiting times between successive bursts also follows a lognormal function , which peaks at @xmath0 49 s. we discussed the idea that sgrs , like earthquakes and solar flares , are manifestations of self - organized critical systems ( bak , tang & wiesenfeld 1988 ) .",
    "all of these results are consistent with the idea that sgr bursts are caused by starquakes , which are the result of a fracture of the crust of a magnetically - powered neutron star , or  magnetar \" ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson and duncan 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "sgr 1806 - 20 exhibited sporadic bursting activity from the launch of batse ( in april 1991 ) until november 1993 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1994 ) . in october 1996 , the source entered a burst active phase .",
    "the reactivation initiated a series of pointed observations with the rxte / pca over a period of two weeks .",
    "these observations led to the discovery of 7.47 s pulsations from sgr 1806 - 20 and confirmed its nature as a magnetar ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these two weeks",
    "rxte / pca recorded a total of 290 bursts . in the batse data , sgr 1806 - 20 burst activity was persistent but variable from october 1996 up to october 1999 with a total of 116 recorded bursts . in this _ letter _ , we present a comprehensive study of the statistical properties of sgr 1806 - 20 by combining several data bases .",
    "sections 2 , 3 and 4 describe the cgro / batse , rxte / pca and ice observations , respectively .",
    "our results are presented in section 5 and discussed in section 6 .",
    "in our analysis we have used discriminator large area detector ( discla ) data with coarse energy resolution ( 4 channels covering energies from 25 kev to @xmath02 mev ) , spectroscopy time - tagged event ( stte ) data and spectroscopy high energy resolution burst ( sherb ) data with fine energy binning ( 256 channels covering energies from 15 kev to @xmath010 mev ) from the spectroscopy detectors .",
    "a detailed description of batse instrumentation and data types can be found in fishman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "batse triggered on 74 bursts between september 1993 and june 1999 .",
    "for 32 of the brightest events , stte or sherb data with detailed spectral information were obtained .",
    "the background subtracted spectra were fit to optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) and power law models .",
    "the ottb model , f(e)@xmath3 e@xmath6@xmath7(@xmath8e / kt ) , provided suitable fits ( 0.76 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath9 1.36 ) to all spectra , with temperatures ranging between 18 and 43 kev .",
    "the power law model failed to fit most of the spectra .",
    "the weighted mean of the ottb temperatures for this sample of 32 events is @xmath11 kev .    to increase our burst sample we performed an off - line search for untriggered batse events from sgr 1806 - 20 using a method explained in detail by woods et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the overall batse burst activity history of sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "we limited our search during active phases of the source .",
    "we found , in addition to the 74 triggered events , 42 untriggered bursts during the time intervals 1993 september 13  1993 november 20 and 1995 september 7  1999 october 26 .",
    "of these 116 events , 111 events ( triggered and untriggered ) had discla data and were sufficiently intense to allow spectral fitting .",
    "because of the long discla data integration time ( 1.024 s ) compared to typical sgr burst durations ( @xmath0 0.1 s ) , we could estimate only the fluence for each event .",
    "we fit the background - subtracted source spectrum to an ottb model with a fixed kt of 20.8 kev , a reasonable choice considering the fairly narrow kt distribution of the triggered bursts derived above .",
    "we find that the burst fluences range between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ergs @xmath14 . for a distance to sgr 1806 - 20 of 14.5 kpc ( corbel et al .",
    "1997 ) , and assuming isotropic emission , the corresponding energy range is @xmath15  @xmath16 ergs . in comparison , the energies of sgr 1900 + 14 bursts seen with batse range between @xmath17  @xmath18 ergs ( g et al .",
    "1999 ) and those of sgr 1627 - 41 between @xmath19  @xmath20 ergs ( woods et al .",
    "we performed 13 pointed observations of sgr 1806 - 20 with the rxte / pca , for a total effective exposure time of @xmath0 141 ks between 1996 november 5 and 18 .",
    "we searched pca standard 1 data ( 2 - 60 kev ) with 0.125 s time resolution for bursts using the following procedure .",
    "for each 0.125 s bin , we estimated a background count rate by fitting a first order polynomial to 5 s of data before and after each bin with a 3 s gap between the bin searched and the background intervals .",
    "bins with count rates exceeding 125 counts/0.125 s were assumed to include burst emission and were excluded from the background intervals .",
    "a burst was defined as any continuous set of bins with count rates above 5.5 @xmath21 of the estimated background . for the typical pca count rate of 12 @xmath8 18 counts/0.125",
    "s in this energy band , 5.5 @xmath21 level corresponds to @xmath0 20 @xmath8 25 counts in a 0.125 s bin .",
    "we found 290 events and measured the count fluence of each burst by simply integrating the background - subtracted counts over the bins covering the event .    to compare the integrated count fluences",
    "obtained with the pca to the batse fluences , we determined a conversion factor between the two as follows .",
    "first , we searched for bursts observed with both instruments and found 8 such events ( 5 of which had triggered batse ) . assuming",
    "a constant ottb model as described in section 2 , we estimated the fluence of these bursts .",
    "we then computed the ratio of the batse fluence to the pca counts of each common event .",
    "these ratios fall within a fairly narrow range ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ergs @xmath14counts@xmath6 ) .",
    "their weighted mean is @xmath24 ergs @xmath14counts@xmath6 with a standard deviation , @xmath21 = @xmath25 ergs @xmath14 counts@xmath6 .",
    "the mean is very close to the one estimated for sgr 1900 + 14 ( g et al .",
    "1999 ) and consistent with the idea that sgr bursts have a similar spectral shape . using this conversion factor , we find that the fluences of the pca bursts range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ergs @xmath14 and the burst energies range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ergs .",
    "from 1978 to 1986 the los alamos grb detector on board ice satellite ( anderson et al .",
    "1978 ) almost continuously observed the galactic center region within which sgr 1806 - 20 is located .",
    "it detected 134 bursts from the source between 1979 january 7 and 1984 june 8 ( laros et al .  1987 ,  1990 ; ulmer et al .",
    "1993 ) . combining observational details given by ulmer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and energy spectral information obtained by ottb fits to bursts ( at energies e @xmath30 30 kev ) given by fenimore et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and atteia et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , we estimate that the ice burst fluences range form @xmath31 to @xmath32 ergs @xmath14 and their corresponding isotropic energies are between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ergs .",
    "from the previous 3 sections , we clearly see that the batse and ice detection sensitivities are quite similar , with pca extending the logn@xmath8logp distribution to lower values .",
    "we now combine all data bases to a common set , enabling several statistical analyses .    _",
    "( i ) burst fluence distributions : _   to eliminate systematic effects due to low count statistics or binning ,",
    "we have employed the maximum likelihood technique to fit the unbinned burst fluences .",
    "a power law fit to 92 batse fluence values between @xmath35 and @xmath13 ergs @xmath14 yields a power law exponent , @xmath5 = @xmath36 ( 68@xmath37 confidence level )",
    ". bursts with fluences below @xmath35 ergs @xmath14 were excluded to avoid undersampling effects due to lower detection efficiency .",
    "figure 2 shows the batse fluences binned into equally spaced logarithmic steps ( filled circles ) .",
    "similarly , we fit the 266 pca fluence values between @xmath38 and @xmath27 ergs @xmath14 to a power law model and obtain a best fit exponent value of 1.43 @xmath39 0.06 ( see fig 2 , diamonds for pca ) . finally , the 113 ice fluences between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ergs @xmath14 yield @xmath5 = 1.67 @xmath39 0.15 ( see fig 2 squares for ice ) .",
    "we find that the power law indices obtained for batse and ice agree well with each other , while the index obtained from pca is marginally lower .",
    "we fit the ice fluences to a power law @xmath42 exponential model and to a broken power law model to search for evidence of a turnover claimed by cheng et al .",
    "neither model provides a statistically significant improvement over a single power law fit .",
    "it is important to note that there is no evidence of a high energy cut - off or a break in the energy distribution ( see fig 2 ) .    _",
    "( ii ) waiting times distribution : _   to measure the waiting times between successive sgr 1806 - 20 bursts , we identified 22 rxte observation windows containing two or more bursts without any gaps .",
    "we then determined 262 recurrence interval times @xmath43 t ( i.e. time difference between successive bursts ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a histogram of the @xmath43ts , which range from 0.25 to 1655 s. we have fit the ( @xmath43t)-distribution to a lognormal function and found a peak at @xmath0 97 s ( with @xmath44 3.6 ) .",
    "this fit does not include waiting times less than 3 s to avoid contribution of double peaked events in which the second peak appears shortly ( @xmath0 0.25@xmath83 s ) after the first one . to correct for biases due to the rxte observation window ( @xmath0 3000 s ) , we performed extensive numerical simulations and found that the intrinsic peak of the distribution should be at @xmath0 103 s. note that the observation windows with no bursts may represent a long - waiting - time tail which is additional to the lognormal distribution .    to investigate the relation between the waiting time till the next burst ( @xmath43@xmath45 ) and the intensity of each burst",
    ", we divided the 290 events sample into 6 intensity intervals , each of which contains approximately 50 events .",
    "we fit the @xmath43@xmath45-distribution also to a lognormal distribution and determined each peak mean-@xmath43@xmath45 ( which range from 82 s to 148 s ) and the mean counts for each of the 6 groups .",
    "we show in figure 4 ( a ) that there is no correlation between @xmath43@xmath45 and the total burst counts ( the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient , @xmath46 = @xmath80.2 with a probability that this correlation occurs in a random data set , p = 0.70 ) .",
    "similarly , we investigated the relation between the elapsed times since the previous burst ( @xmath43@xmath47 ) and the intensity of the bursts .",
    "we find that mean-@xmath43@xmath47 extends from 77 s to 120 s. figure 4 ( b ) shows that there is also no correlation between mean-@xmath43@xmath47 and the burst counts ( @xmath46 = @xmath48 , p = 0.46 ) .",
    "the fluence distributions of the sgr 1806 - 20 bursts seen with ice and batse are well described by single power laws with indices 1.67 @xmath39 0.15 and 1.76 @xmath39 0.17 , respectively , while rxte bursts have an index of 1.43 @xmath39 0.06 .",
    "these indices are similar to those found for sgr 1900 + 14 ( 1.66 , g et al .",
    "1999 ) and sgr 1627 - 41 ( 1.62 , woods et al .",
    "the ice and batse values are consistent with one another , over nearly the same energy range but at different epochs .",
    "this suggests that sgr event fluence distributions may not vary greatly in time , therefore , we combine the ice and batse values to calculate a `` high - energy '' index , @xmath5 = 1.71 @xmath39 0.11 . the difference between the `` low - energy '' ( rxte ) index and the `` high - energy '' index is insignificant ( @xmath0 2.3 @xmath21 ) ;",
    "more `` high - energy '' data are needed to determine whether there is a break in the distribution .",
    "power law energy distributions have also been found for earthquakes with @xmath5 = 1.4 to 1.8 ( gutenberg & richter 1956 ; chen et al .",
    "1991 ; lay & wallace 1995 ) , and solar flares , @xmath5 = 1.53 to 1.73 ( crosby et al . 1993 , lu et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this is a typical behavior seen in self - organized critical systems .",
    "the concept of self - organized criticality ( bak , tang & wiesenfeld 1988 ) states that sub - systems self - organize due to some driving force to a critical state at which a slight perturbation can cause a chain reaction of any size within the system .",
    "sgr power law fluence distributions , along with a lognormal waiting time distribution support the idea that systems responsible for sgr bursts are in a state of self - organized criticality .",
    "we believe that in sgrs , the critical systems are neutron star crusts strained by evolving magnetic stresses ( cf . thompson & duncan  1995 ) .",
    "cheng et al . ( 1996 ) suggested that there is a high energy cut - off in the cumulative energy distribution of sgr 1806 - 20 bursts seen by ice . in a cumulative energy distribution ,",
    "the values of neighboring points are correlated , consequently , judging the significance of apparent deviations is very difficult . for these reasons we used a maximum likelihood fitting technique and displayed the differential energy distributions ( e.g fig.2 ) .",
    "we find no evidence for a high - energy cut - off in the ice data of sgr 1806 - 20 up to burst energies @xmath49 ergs .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a high energy cut - off or turnover must exist because otherwise the total energy diverges .",
    "the distribution of waiting times of sgr 1806 - 20 bursts observed with rxte is well described by a lognormal function , similar to that found by hurley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the bursts seen with ice .",
    "the waiting times of the rxte events are on average shorter than the ones observed with ice , maybe due to different burst active phase of the source or to instrumental sensitivity ( the pca is more sensitive to weaker bursts than ice , and the system displayed plenty of weaker bursts as well as strong ones in 1996 ) , or combination of both .",
    "recently g et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the recurrence time distribution of sgr 1900 + 14 bursts observed with rxte is also a lognormal function which peaks at @xmath0 49 s. the lack of any correlation between the intensity and the waiting time until the next burst agrees well with the results of ice observations of sgr 1806 - 20 ( laros et al . 1987 ) .",
    "this behavior , also seen in sgr 1900 + 14 ( g et al .",
    "1999 ) confirms that the physical mechanism responsible for sgr bursts is different from systems where accretion - powered outbursts take place ( e.g. the rapid burster , lewin et al .",
    "1976 , and the bursting pulsar , kouveliotou et al . 1996 )    the burst activity of sgr 1806 - 20 over the last three years is considerably different from that of sgr 1900 + 14 . after a long period with almost no bursts ,",
    "batse recorded 200 bursts from sgr 1900 + 14 between 1998 may and 1999 january , with a remarkably low activity thereafter . on the other hand , after sgr 1806 - 20 reactivated in 1996 , it continued bursting on a lower rate , with 18 bursts in 1997 , 32 in 1998 and 18 in 1999 through october .",
    "the latest rxte observations of sgr 1806 - 20 in 1999 august revealed that smaller scale bursts are still occurring occasionally in this system , whereas contemporaneous rxte observations of sgr 1900 + 14 do not show burst activity of any size .",
    "this continuation of burst activity may prevent the deposition of very large amounts of stress in the crust .",
    "therefore , in sgr 1806 - 20 it may be less likely to expect , in the near future , a giant flare from this source , as the ones seen on 1979 march 5 from sgr 0526 - 66 ( mazetz et al . 1979 ) and on 1998",
