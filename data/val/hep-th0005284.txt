    "the casalbuoni - brink - schwarz ( cbs ) @xcite superparticle has played an important conceptual role for superstring theory as a source of new inspiration for the solution of the problems encountered in the attempt to quantize supersymmetric string theories in a manifestly covariant manner . an extensive literature on the quantization of the superparticle exists ( see @xcite and references given there ) . in these papers",
    "the quantization including the construction of the physical hilbert space is carried out by means of the covariant becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin or batalin - fradkin - vilkovisky methods .    as we shall see in the present paper an alternative method for construction of the superparticle state space",
    "is provided by wigner s method of induced representations @xcite applied to the @xmath0 super - poincar group .",
    "our other main concern is the connection between the conventional formulation of the superparticle and the basic understanding of spinning point particles provided by the classical papers of pryce @xcite who showed that there is a freedom in the choice of spin operator corresponding to the arbitrariness of the relativistic center of mass .    for a spinning particle",
    "the total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum @xmath2 and the spin @xmath3 which must obey some constraints . in particular , for a massive particle the pryce constraints @xmath4 with the nice feature of covariance , are equivalent to the wigner constraints @xmath5 which arise naturally by the method of induced representations of the poincar ' e group @xcite .",
    "here we shall mainly deal with the connection between ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ wc ] ) .",
    "the spin operators and the corresponding position operators are related by linear transformations the details of which can be found in appendix [ spcon ] . remarkably , in the customary formulation of the superparticle the constraints ( [ pc ] ) are realized automatically , and as a consequence the components of the position operator do not commute , cf .",
    "( [ xwithx ] ) .",
    "however , it was observed by brink and schwarz @xcite that a redefinition is possible in such a way that the components of the new position operator commute mutually .",
    "their transformation formula is reminiscent of eq .",
    "( [ xfrax ] ) relating the position operators in the two cases where ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ wc ] ) apply .    in an earlier publication",
    "@xcite it was shown that the freedom of choice of spin constraints actually can be viewed as a gauge symmetry .",
    "this gauge symmetry is in the present paper extended to the supersymmetric point particle in a generalized version of the cbs particle that , however , is physically equivalent to the original one .",
    "this gauge symmetry reduces in a special case to the @xmath6-symmetry of siegel @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was also found that the dynamical degrees of freedom of a non - supersymmetric point particle can be described by canonical coordinates on the poincar group manifold .",
    "a similar analysis of the supersymmetric point particle is made below .",
    "the particle will in this case move on the super - poincar ' e group manifold projected onto the physical superspace by means of supervielbeins constructed in accordance with the supermanifold formalism of de witt @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual mass shell constraint and spin constraints one must now impose a set of fermionic constraints on the supercoordinate .",
    "we find that this system is equivalent to the superparticle considered in @xcite .",
    "using a modified method of gauge unfixing @xcite it is seen that the gauge freedom in the choice of the spin constraints found for the non - supersymmetric particle is still present .",
    "furthermore , it is demonstrated that the gauge unfixed theory can be gauge fixed again in such a way that the dirac brackets lead to the same commutation relations as the method of induced representations .",
    "finally it is indeed found that the transition from eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) to ( [ wc ] ) as well as the redefinition of position variables of brink and schwarz ( see @xcite eq .",
    "( 21 ) ) constitute gauge transformations .",
    "the analysis will be carried out in several steps .",
    "first , in sec . [ fact ] a factorization of a general super - poincar ' e transformation into an ordinary poincar transformation and a supertranslation is found .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ wigner ] , the wigner construction of the representations of the poincar ' e group @xcite is extended to the super - poincar ' e group by means of this factorization .",
    "the clifford vacuum method of salam and strathdee @xcite is used in the basic frame of the little group and we restrict ourselves for simplicity to the case of a spinless clifford vacuum . in this way",
    "one finds that the constraints ( [ wc ] ) still occurs as a natural candidate for a set of spin constraints .",
    "an explicit expression for the spatial part of the spin operator is derived from the structure relations in sec .",
    "[ spinop ] , and by use of the constraints ( [ wc ] ) the rest of the components of the spin operator is determined .",
    "the superparticle is then in sec .",
    "[ maspart ] identified with a particle moving on the super - poincar manifold .",
    "the constraints on the spin operator are obtained by imposing a set of constraints on the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "these fermionic constraints give rise to a second class constraint algebra ( see @xcite and references given there ) and thus do not define a gauge theory . in sec .",
    "[ gaugetheory ] we use gauge unfixing @xcite , where half of these constraints are singled out to form a first class algebra , and next gauge fix the resulting gauge theory suitably , thus obtaining a spin operator which obeys either one of the sets of constraints ( [ pc])-([wc ] ) or some other constraints depending on the choice of gauge .",
    "we present two varieties of gauge unfixing the theory , using projection operators constructed either by means of @xmath7 ( in four dimensions ) or the free massless dirac operator , and in each case construct dirac brackets .",
