    "high - energy @xmath0-ray  pulsars have proven to have complex , often extended , pulse profiles . by extracting only those photons which arrive during a specified phase interval ,",
    "the emission characteristics of an individual pulse pulse profile component can be determined , providing there are sufficient photon statistics .",
    "fortunately , the three brightest compact sources in the @xmath0-ray  sky are the high - energy @xmath0-ray  pulsars crab ( psr b0531 + 21 ) , geminga ( psr j0633 + 1746 ) , and vela ( psr b0833@xmath245 ) . the spectral properties of the pulse profile components from these pulsars have been investigated previously using data from both cos b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and egret ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the earlier analyses for crab and vela compared the angular distribution of the data with the instrument point - spread distribution to define the source flux ; no use was made of a detailed background model .",
    "thus the non - source background level was not well determined . in the geminga analysis by mayer - hasselwander",
    "( 1994 ) , the non - source background in the pulse profile was determined by spatial ( cross correlation ) analysis of the counts in the off - pulse phase interval , simultaneously accounting for the model - predicted diffuse emission . in the present analysis ,",
    "the increase in photon statistics available through the first 3.5 years of egret observations allows 20 phase intervals to be analyzed individually for all three pulsars by a spatial analysis procedure based on the maximum - likelihood concept ( @xcite ) , where the non - source background has been accounted for on the basis of an improved model of the diffuse emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "some differences from earlier results may be caused by differences in the analysis techniques . within this analysis each pulsar is analyzed by the same procedure , making their results directly comparable",
    ".    an improved knowledge of the emission characteristics as a function of pulsar rotation phase will lead to a better understanding of the emission processes and pulsar geometries responsible for modulated high - energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "in particular , the phase - resolved behavior may be used to discriminate between the two most popular classes of models for pulsed high - energy @xmath0-radiation : the polar cap models ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which propose that @xmath0-rays  result from energetic charged particles accelerated along the magnetic field lines just above the polar cap surfaces , and the outer gap models ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which it is postulated that @xmath0-rays  are produced by charged particles accelerated in vacuum gaps formed in the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "polar cap @xmath0-radiation should be narrowly beamed in the same direction as the radio emission , with a possible high - energy cutoff in the photon spectrum due to attenuation by the strong magnetic field near the polar cap surface .",
    "the outer gap @xmath0-ray  beam is expected to be broad and complex , consisting of emission generated along the last closed field lines .",
    "this paper examines the phase - resolved emission characteristics of the three brightest high - energy @xmath0-ray  pulsars crab , vela , and geminga .",
    "a limited phase - resolved analysis of the high - energy @xmath0-ray  emission from psr b1706@xmath244 is presented by thompson et  al .",
    "the remaining two pulsars detected by egret , psr b1055@xmath252 and psr b1951 + 32 , do not yet have sufficient photon counting statistics to perform a meaningful phase - resolved study of their emission ( @xcite ) .",

    "the total level of emission from crab is the average of the plotted values .",
    "the error bars represent the @xmath30 statistical uncertainty levels .",
    "the values are plotted on a logarithmic scale because the photon flux varies by almost two orders of magnitude across the pulse profile , with the single bin centered about the first peak accounting for @xmath3 35% of the total crab emission . unlike the phase histogram shown in the top panel ,",

    "previous studies of the high - energy @xmath0-ray  emission from the crab complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have treated the emission in the offpulse ( op ) region of the pulse profile as an unpulsed component due entirely to the crab nebula .",
    "this is in analogy with observational results at lower energies , where the total crab luminosity is dominated by the nebular contribution . unlike detectors at lower energies",
    ", however , current @xmath0-ray  telescopes do not have sufficient angular resolution to separate the pulsar radiation from any possible nebular emission . as will be shown in the following sections , it is very likely that much of the emission in the offpulse phase interval comes from the pulsar itself .",
    "it is noteworthy that the photon flux level measured for the phase bin at @xmath32 is comparable to the flux level measured over the offpulse phase interval .",
    "it had been assumed that the emission throughout the bridge region was well above the offpulse emission level .",
    "an unpulsed component present in the crab pulse profile can be no greater than flux measured in the weakest phase bin .",
    "thus , an unpulsed component has a maximum flux of @xmath33 photons  @xmath23  s@xmath24 , or @xmath34 of the total crab emission above 100 mev .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ crab_hardness ] plots the hardness ratios calculated for the same set of phase bins .",
    "there is no data point plotted for the bin centered at phase @xmath35 because the paucity of counts in that bin prevented a detection in the 100300 mev energy range .",
    "the most striking aspect of this plot is the absence of a strong correlation to the features in the pulse profile .",
    "the hardness ratio increases smoothly as the pulsar phase moves across the first pulse , leveling out in the bridge region before reaching its maximum value in the leading wing of the second peak ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a weak detection of this bin in the 100300 mev energy range leads to the relatively large error bar .",
    "as the phase increases through the second peak , the hardness ratio decreases back to the soft level of the offpulse emission .",
    "it is interesting that the extreme hardness ratios are in the bridge and offpulse phase intervals , not near the two peaks which dominate the pulsar lightcurve .",
    "the phase histogram , phase - resolved instantaneous flux , and hardness ratio distribution of geminga are shown in figure  [ geminga_hardness ] .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in the top panel indicate the definitions of the pulse profile components listed in table  [ geminga_phasedef ] , and the horizontal dashed line shows the non - source background emission , calculated in the same way as was done for the crab .",
    "note that the dashed line is close to the observed points in the phase region leading the first pulse ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the plot of the instantaneous flux level above 100 mev shows that geminga has an even higher average level of offpulse emission than does the crab .",
    "however , unlike the crab pulsar , geminga has no known nebular association , and it must be assumed that the high level of emission seen throughout most of the pulse profile is coming directly from the pulsar , as noted previously by mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "the flux at phase @xmath37 is @xmath38 the emission measured from either of the adjacent phase bins , and , even considering the large uncertainties , represents a significant drop in intensity .",
    "this statistical significance of this bin is less than 2.5@xmath31 , so this point should conservatively be treated as an upper limit .",
    "any unpulsed component to the total geminga emission can not be stronger than the flux level of @xmath39 photons  @xmath23  s@xmath24  measured in this bin .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath40 of the total geminga emission .",
    "as opposed to the crab pulsar , the emission level over the entire bridge region of the geminga pulse profile is much higher than the offpulse emission level . except for the one low bin ,",

    "there is perhaps a local maximum in the hardness ratio at the location of the first peak , with even harder emission in the latter part of the bridge region and the second peak . in general , the geminga hardness ratios are much higher than those measured for the crab pulsar .",
    "figure  [ vela_hardness ] shows the phase histogram , phase - resolved flux , and hardness ratios for the vela pulsar , with the pulse profile components defined in table  [ vela_phasedef ] indicated by vertical dashed lines in the top panel .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the non - source background emission , calculated in the same way as was done for the crab .",
    "the increased statistics and complicated morphology of the vela pulse profile allows for the introduction of two additional components not defined by kanbach et  al .",
    "for lack of better names , these have been denoted as `` interpulse 1 '' ( ip1 ) and `` interpulse 2 '' ( ip2 ) , and they correspond to the slight plateau after the first peak and its trailing edge , respectively .",

    "although seven of the eight phase bins in the offpulse region have a measured flux above the diffuse background , none of the individual bins in the offpulse region measure strong detections , and one of the bins has only an upper limit .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the crab and geminga , which show significant emission over most of the pulsar phase .",
    "a likelihood analysis of the entire offpulse phase region 0.640.02 finds a point - source signal at a 5.6@xmath31 confidence level and an instantaneous flux of @xmath42 photons  @xmath23  s@xmath24 .",
    "thus , there is evidence that vela has emission beyond the phase region traditionally associated with the pulsar , even though the data do not justify the claim that the emission extends throughout the full rotation .",
    "if this level of emission is assumed present throughout the pulse profile , it represents only @xmath43 of the total emission , which does not conflict with the upper limits to unpulsed emission established by grenier et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) or kanbach et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) . even though the flux levels measured in the offpulse regions of the crab and vela pulsars are comparable , the vela flux values have larger uncertainties because the egret exposure to vela was @xmath3 2/3 that of the crab over the first three cycles of instrument operation .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ vela_hardness ] shows the distribution of hardness ratios across the vela pulse profile . the weak level of offpulse emission combined with the limited egret exposure to vela prevented a useful determination of hardness ratios over the phase range 0.850.05 .",
    "the phase evolution of the vela hardness ratio is reminiscent of the behavior of the crab hardness ratio ( figure  [ crab_hardness ] ) . as with the crab pulsar ,",
    "the vela emission becomes harder as the phase moves through the first peak and softer as the phase increases past the second peak into the offpulse component .",
    "to further investigate the implied spectral variation as a function of rotation phase implied by the hardness ratio distributions of the three bright @xmath0-ray  pulsars , differential photon spectra over the egret energy range are derived for the various pulsar components defined in tables  [ crab_phasedef ] , [ geminga_phasedef ] , and [ vela_phasedef ] .",
    "each component spectrum is derived by performing standard likelihood spatial analysis ( @xcite ) in ten independent energy intervals using only those photons within the corresponding phase range . as noted by esposito et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the egret in - flight calibration checks showed that the original calibration below 70 mev was in error .",
    "the corrections necessarily introduce larger uncertainties in the 30 - 50 mev and 50 - 70 mev data points than found in the other energy bins .",
    "the photon spectrum derived from likelihood spatial analysis of the total crab emission is shown in figure  [ crab_tot_spec ] for the energy range 30 mev10 gev .",

    "( 1993 ) and ramanamurthy et al .",
    "( 1995b ) . however , the first three energy bins from 30100 mev deviate significantly from the trend established by the higher energy bins .",
    "a spectral power law fit including all ten energy bins results in a @xmath46  value of 47.5 with 8 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , implying that the probability that the 10 measured values are drawn from a photon spectrum behaving as a simple power law over the entire egret energy range is @xmath47 .",
    "even the restricted fit above 100 mev measures a @xmath46  of 10.7 for 5 dof , corresponding to a probability of 5.9% .",
    "figure  [ crab_comp_spec ] shows the instantaneous photon spectra derived from likelihood analysis of the phase intervals defined in table  [ crab_phasedef ] .",
    "the time - averaged spectra are obtained by multiplying the flux values by the phase width of each component . for each component , a spectral fit is only performed over the energy interval for which the data points were reasonably consistent with a power law distribution .",
    "not surprisingly , component spectra reflect many of the features suggested by the hardness plot of figure  [ crab_hardness ] .",
    "the softest components in the crab lightcurve are the second pulse trailing wing ( tw2 ) , offpulse ( op ) , and first pulse leading wing ( lw1 ) components .",
    "the pulsar emission is hardest in the bridge and leading wing of the second pulse ( lw2 ) .",
    "the only component to show some evidence of a high energy turnover is the first peak ( p1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of pulsed emission at tev energies ( e.g. @xcite ) indicates that the pulsed emission must have a cutoff between the egret and tev energy ranges . although based on more extensive data , the principal characteristics of the phase - resolved spectral components are similar to those found by nolan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the pulsed emission alone .",
    "much like the total spectrum of figure  [ crab_tot_spec ] , the first pulse trailing wing ( tw1 ) , bridge , lw2 , and op components all appear to have a softer spectrum at energies less than 100 mev which deviates from the power law established above 100 mev .",
    "this implied spectral break is especially apparent for the bridge and offpulse regions , the two weakest components of the crab pulse profile . to investigate this behavior ,",
    "the spectra are fit with a double power law of the form @xmath48 figure  [ crab_tot_dbl ] shows the double power law fit to the total crab emission , and figure  [ crab_comp_dbl ] shows similar fits to spectra of the tw1 , bridge , lw2 , and op components .",

    "besides being significantly harder and having no ultra - soft low - energy component , the geminga total spectrum is much different than the crab total spectrum in that it shows a sharp spectral turnover at high energies .",
    "the spectral result appears consistent with that of mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , indicating that the differences in analysis technique have no strong influence on the results .",
    "the individual component spectra of geminga are shown in figure  [ geminga_comp_spec ] . with the exception of perhaps the tw2 and offpulse phase intervals ,",
    "all of the components show some indication of a turnover at high energies , typically around a few gev .",
    "as is suggested by the distribution of hardness ratios , the p2 component has a significantly flatter spectrum than any of the other phase intervals .",
    "indeed , it is the hardest spectrum yet measured by egret .",
    "the softest components are the op and lw1 phase intervals , which are also the only two components that are not detected at the highest energies .",
    "the lw1 and p1 components appear to exhibit the earliest and strongest spectral turnovers .",
    "again , these results are completely compatible with those of mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although the definitions of phase intervals are somewhat different .",
    "the vela total photon spectrum is presented in figure  [ vela_tot_spec ] . over the energy range 302000 mev ,",
    "the spectrum is consistent with a power low of index @xmath72 . like geminga",
    ", vela exhibits a spectral turnover above @xmath3 1  gev .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is similar to that found by kanbach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although the formal errors on the spectral index do not overlap .",
    "some of this may be attributable to time - dependent corrections applied to the long - term egret database ( @xcite ) after the work of kanbach et al .",
    "it may also reflect the fact that systematic uncertainties become important for a bright source like vela , and such systematics are not shown in the statistical error bars . although it may appear that the vela spectrum is inconsistent with the fitted power law at energies below 70 mev , the uncertainties associated with the flux values measured for the lowest two energy bins are large , and the deviations are not statistically significant .",
    "nevertheless , the osse detection of unpulsed emission from the vela synchrotron nebula in the 0.061 to @xmath34 mev range ( @xcite ) , indicates that there must be a turn - up of the total vela spectrum near or below the egret energy range .",
    "the low - energy egret points are consistent with the cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum near 40 mev predicted by de jager , harding , & strickman .",
    "the instantaneous differential photon spectra of the components defined in table  [ vela_phasedef ] are presented in figure  [ vela_comp_spec ] . for the op component ,",
    "some energy bins had to be combined so that likelihood analysis could produce a reasonable flux estimate .",
    "except for the op interval , all of the vela pulsar components show a turnover at energies on the order of a few gev , with the lw1 and p1 spectra exhibiting the earliest deviations from power law behavior . only the tw2 component fails to produce a signal at the highest energies .",
    "the ip2 phase interval is the hardest component , as was suggested by the hardness ratio distribution of figure  [ vela_hardness ] .",
    "although the phase bins do not match those of kanbach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) exactly , the similarities of the two sets of phase - resolved spectra are evident .",
    "a systematic , phase - resolved analysis of the total photon flux above 100 mev reveals that crab , geminga , and vela all have significant emission in large portions of the `` offpulse '' phase intervals .",
    "as opposed to studies of the crab region , multiwavelength observations of geminga and vela give no reason to believe that their offpulse @xmath0-ray  emission might be due to nebular emission .",
    "if the geminga and vela pulsars are producing high - energy @xmath0-ray  emission throughout much of the rotation phase , then it is reasonable to assume that at least some of the emission in the crab offpulse region is also generated by the pulsar itself .",
    "it is worth noting that for all three pulse profiles , the lowest level of emission occurs just before the first @xmath0-raypeak . while this result is not statistically significant , it may be an early indication that the offpulse emission is really composed of the extended tail(s ) of the major @xmath0-ray  peaks .",
    "although it is not apparent from the phase histograms shown in the top panels of figures  [ crab_hardness ] , [ geminga_hardness ] , and [ vela_hardness ] , phase - resolved analysis shows that the bridge emission is different for each of the three bright pulsars .",
    "midway between its two peaks , the crab bridge emission drops to an intensity level which is consistent with the weak emission in the offpulse region .",
    "the vela bridge emission also varies substantially , but remains at a consistently high flux level and has a minimum very near the second peak .",
    "the emission from geminga is both strong and relatively steady throughout the bridge region .    despite the reduced photon statistics incurred by phase - resolved analysis",
    ", it is possible to acquire spectral information in most of the twenty phase bins by employing a hardness ratio such as that defined in equation  ( [ hardness ] ) .",
    "the crab and vela spectral variation are qualitatively similar in that the hardness ratios increase smoothly through the first peak , have maximum values near the bridge region , and drop off after the second pulse .",
    "the vela hardness ratios are typically greater than those of the crab pulsar . also , vela becomes dramatically harder after the first pulse , an effect not seen in the crab hardness ratios .",
    "in contrast to crab and vela , the hardness ratio for geminga is strongly correlated with the features in its pulse profile .",
    "there are two broad plateaus corresponding to the first peak and bridge region , with an even larger hardness ratio at the location of the second peak .",
    "for all three pulsars , the softest ratios are in the offpulse region .",
    "spectra derived from likelihood analysis of the individual pulse profile components confirm the behavior suggested by the distribution of hardness ratios .",
    "of the three bright @xmath0-ray  pulsars , the softest emission occurs in the leading wing of the first crab pulse which has a measured spectral index of @xmath73 , with an almost identical spectral index measured for the trailing wing of the second pulse .",
    "the hardest pulsar component is the second peak from geminga , which has a measured spectral index of @xmath74 .",
    "the latter part of the vela interpulse component is almost as hard with a measured spectral index of @xmath75 .    for all three pulsars , the component spectra share the same basic features as the total spectra .",
    "that is to say , the high - energy spectral turnovers which are apparent in the vela and geminga total spectra also are also evident in the various component spectra .",
    "likewise , the crab profile components show the same soft emission at low energies that is apparent in the total crab spectra , and only the leading peak shows some evidence of a high - energy turnover in its photon spectrum .",
    "interestingly , for both the vela and geminga pulsars , the leading peak spectrum similarly turns over at a lower energy than the other pulsar components .",
    "the four weakest crab pulsar components are dominated by ultra - soft emission at energies below @xmath3100 mev .",
    "double power law fits to the photon spectra from these four components show that the soft emission appears at roughly the same level in each component , with an average spectral index of @xmath76 and a flux of @xmath77 photons  @xmath23  s@xmath24  mev@xmath24  at 100 mev .",
    "this ultra - soft emission is also apparent in a double power law fit to the total crab emission , clearly indicating that it is an unpulsed component to the crab @xmath0-ray  emission .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect ultra - soft nebular emission out to energies on the order of @xmath78  mev .",
    "the emission at x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray  energies is consistent with synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons streaming from the pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the crab pulsar is unlikely to produce electrons with energies greater than @xmath79@xmath80 ev , the synchrotron spectrum will begin to rollover at energies above a few mev .",
    "the soft emission observed from 30100 mev is then seen as the tail end of the synchrotron emission from the nebula .",
    "detailed modeling of the crab emission by de jager et al .",
    "( 1996 ) confirms this qualitative picture .",
    "the detection of unpulsed emission from the crab complex at tev energies ( @xcite ) implies that there is emission from the nebula beyond the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the tev emission is explainable in terms of inverse - compton scattering ( @xcite ) , which has also been proposed as a possible explanation of the harder - spectrum offpulse emission above 1 gev .",
    "however , based on the level of the tev emission , the expected inverse - compton contribution at energies on the order of @xmath31 gev is below the egret flux measurements ( @xcite ) . considering the non - zero offpulse emission seen from the geminga and vela pulsars ,",
    "it is very likely that the bulk of the hard power - law component of the crab offpulse emission is generated by the pulsar itself .",
    "original polar cap models of pulsar @xmath0-ray  emission ( e.g.@xcite ) suggested that double - peaked pulse profiles were produces by pulsars whose rotation axis was nearly orthogonal to its dipole axis .",
    "however , this could not explain peak separations much different than 0.5 in rotation phase or strong bridge emission between peaks .",
    "since at least five of the six high - energy @xmath0-ray  pulsars have more than one peak ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is unlikely that these are all orthogonal rotators whose beams cross the line of sight to the earth .",
    "more recent incarnations of the polar cap models ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have made use of the fact that a pulsar with closely aligned rotation and magnetic axes pointed in the direction of the earth will produce a hollow cone of emission from a single polar cap and result in two observed peaks , corresponding to when the line of sight from the earth enters and exits the hollow cone .",
    "yet phase - resolved analysis shows that all three bright @xmath0-ray  pulsars have emission across much of the rotation phase , which for the single pole outer gap model demands that the rotation and dipole axes have an aspect angle no greater than the radius of the polar cap cone of emission .",
    "for the narrow beaming angles associated with the standard polar cap model ( e.g.   @xcite ) , this suggests that there is an very large population of young nearby neutron stars with closely aligned rotation and dipole axes .",
    "daugherty & harding ( 1996 ) refined the single polar cap model by allowing the accelerating regions above the polar caps to extend out to heights on the order of a neutron star radius , significantly increasing the solid angle into which the cone of @xmath0-ray  emission is beamed . not only does this make it more likely that a pulsar beam will cross the line of sight from the earth , but it relaxes the requirement that the pulsar rotation and dipole axes be nearly aligned . under these assumptions ,",
    "daugherty & harding ( 1996 ) are able to closely reproduce the vela pulse profile observed by egret , matching the narrow peak duty cycles , observed peak separation , and enhanced bridge emission .",
    "they also predict there will be a finite level of emission outside of the two peaks due to residual high - altitude cascades .",
    "a natural consequence of this scenario is that the bridge emission will be harder than the peak emission since it comes from the interior of the polar cap where the curvature radiation is less likely to cross magnetic field lines and be reprocessed into softer cascade photons .",
    "the emission outside of the peaks is due to high - altitude curvature radiation from electrons which have lost much of their peak energy , so this emission is expected to be the softest .",
    "it is also expected that the photon spectra from the peaks will turn over at lower energies than the spectra from the bridge regions since the peak emission will be more heavily attenuated by the magnetic field .",
    "it has already been noted that the leading peaks of the crab , vela , and geminga pulsars have spectra which appear to turn over at lower energies than the other pulsar components .",
    "while the measured hardness ratio distributions of the crab and vela pulsars qualitatively agree with the behavior expected for this polar cap scenario , the phase - resolved spectral behavior of the geminga pulsar presents some problems . by far",
    "the hardest emission from geminga comes from the second peak .",
    "moreover , the emission between the peaks shows a sharper high - energy spectral turnover than the second peak .",
    "both of these conditions indicate that the emission producing the second geminga peak is not being significantly reprocessed to softer photons by the magnetic field .",
    "the emission pattern of the magnetic compton - induced pair cascade model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is similar to that of the curvature radiation - induced pair cascade model of daugherty & harding ( 1996 ) , except the high - energy @xmath0-ray  emission is produced close to the surface of the star , resulting in a much narrower @xmath0-ray  beam . in calculating the @xmath0-ray  spectral index as a function of pulsar phase , sturner , dermer , & michel ( 1995 )",
    "find that the hardest emission should come from the bridge region and the softest emission from the two peaks .",
    "this agrees somewhat with the observational results for the crab and vela pulsars  although the observed hardness ratios are not directly correlated with the peaks as suggested by sturner et  al .",
    "( 1995)but is in conflict with the extremely hard photon spectrum measured for the second @xmath0-ray  peak of geminga .",
    "moreover , the pulse profiles modeled by sturner et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) do not reflect the narrow duty cycles of the peaks , strong bridge emission , nor the significant offpulse emission observed from the three brightest @xmath0-ray   pulsars .",
    "chiang & romani ( 1992 ) found that outer gap emission from a single pole produces a broad , irregularly - shaped beam of emission which is particularly dense near the edges , so that two @xmath0-ray  peaks are observed when the line of sight from the earth crosses these enhanced regions of the @xmath0-ray  beam , while the inner region of the beam provides a significant amount of emission between the peaks .",
    "a wide range of peak phase separations can be accommodated with a proper choice of the observer co - latitude .",
    "double - peaked pulse profiles of varying phase separation and strong bridge emission occur naturally in this model .",
    "the non - zero offpulse emission can be seen as resulting from residual pair cascades high in the outer magnetosphere due to the complex geometry and interaction of emission processes in the outer magnetosphere , no detailed spectra or luminosities have been modeled for single pole outer gap model .",
    "a clue to the nature of pulsar @xmath0-ray  emission may come from the fact that for each of the three bright @xmath0-ray  pulsars , the individual component spectra have comparable high - energy turnovers , if any .",
    "magnetic field attenuation would be a likely cause of the spectral turnovers if the the various pulsar components are being generated close to the surface of the neutron star , where the local magnetic field is strong .",
    "however , if the turnovers are due to attenuation by the magnetic field , the crab pulsar with an inferred surface magnetic field of @xmath81  g should show a sharper spectral break than a weaker field pulsar like geminga , which has an inferred surface magnetic field of @xmath82  g. it is also possible that the spectral turnovers are the result of a cutoff in the source distribution of charged particles at high energies . assuming the maximum energy attainable by a charged particle is directly related to the maximum potential drop of the pulsar , which goes as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the surface magnetic field and @xmath85 is the rotation period of the pulsar",
    ", one would expect the crab pulsar to have the highest charged particle distribution turnover energy among the three bright @xmath0-ray  pulsars , while geminga should have the lowest .",
    "this could be why the crab photon spectrum shows no strong spectral turnover below 10 gev , while geminga has a sharp turnover .",
    "on the other hand , psr b1951 + 32 , with a @xmath86 lower than vela s , shows no high - energy cutoff ( @xcite ) .",
    "a spectral turnover caused by a dropoff in the distribution of primary charged particles at high energies will be reflected in both the total emission photon spectrum and the individual component spectra .",
    "however , it is not clear why the first peak of the the @xmath0-ray  pulsars seems to have a slightly stronger cutoff than do the other pulsar components .",
    "perhaps the first peak originates closer to the surface of the pulsar where the local magnetic field is stronger and there is a higher degree of magnetic field attenuation , but then it might be expected that the first peak should be softer than the other components due to the significant reprocessing of high - energy photons to lower energies . while vela and geminga have somewhat softer leading peaks , the crab pulsar does not .",
    "even though there is some question as to the exact location in the magnetosphere where each pulse profile component is generated , the significant variation in hardness ratio as a function of rotation phase indicates the line of sight to the pulsar is sweeping across field lines with a broad range in curvature radii .",
    "most likely , the softest components come from the regions with the most curved field lines .",
    "the two peaks of the crab and vela pulsars are softer than the bridge regions , which suggests that the peaks might be at least partially due to the increase in curvature radiation one would expect along the most curved field lines . yet , the second peak of geminga , which is actually the stronger peak , has the hardest measured spectral index of any object or pulsar component observed by egret .",
    "either the primary charged particle distribution responsible for this peak has a very enhanced , flat number spectrum , or , more plausibly , the second geminga peak results from inverse - compton scattering , which can reasonably produce an intense , hard photon spectrum . the second peak of geminga appears to be direct evidence that processes besides curvature radiation and synchrotron radiation are playing an important role in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
