    "in order to develop a practical natural language processing ( nlp ) system , it is essential to deal with ill - formed sentences that can not be parsed correctly according to the grammar rules in the system . in this paper ,",
    "an `` ill - formed sentence '' means one that can not be parsed as a unified structure .",
    "a syntactic parser with general grammar rules is often unable to analyze not only sentences with grammatical errors and ellipses , but also long sentences , owing to their complexity .",
    "thus , ill - formed sentences include not only ungrammatical sentences , but also some grammatical sentences that can not be parsed as unified structures owing to the presence of unknown words or to a lack of completeness in the syntactic parser . in texts from a restricted domain , such as computer manuals ,",
    "most sentences are grammatically correct",
    ". however , even a well - established syntactic parser usually fails to generate a unified parsed structure for about 10 to 20 percent of all the sentences in such texts , and the failure to generate a unified parsed structure in syntactic analysis leads to a failure in the output of a nlp system .",
    "thus , it is indispensable to establish a correct analysis for such a sentence .    to handle such sentences ,",
    "most previous approaches apply various heuristic rules @xcite , including    * relaxing constraints in the condition part of a grammatical rule , such as number and gender constraints * joining partial parses by using meta rules .    either way , the output reflects the general plausibility of an analysis that can be obtained from information in the sentence ; however , the interpretation of a sentence depends on its discourse , and inconsistency with recovered parses that contain different analyses of the same phrase in other sentences in the discourse often results in odd outputs of the natural language processing system .",
    "starting from the viewpoint that an interpretation of a sentence must be consistent in its discourse , we worked on completing incomplete parses by using information extracted from complete parses in the discourse .",
    "the results were encouraging .",
    "since most words in a sentence are repeatedly used in other sentences in the discourse , the complete parses of well - formed sentences usually provided some useful information for completing incomplete parses in the same discourse .",
    "thus , rather than trying to enhance a syntactic parser s grammar rules in order to support ill - formed sentences , which seems to be an endless task after the parser has obtained enough coverage to parse general grammatical sentences , we treat the syntactic parser as a black box and complete incomplete parses , in the form of partially parsed chunks that a bottom - up parser outputs for ill - formed sentences , by using information extracted from the discourse .    in the next section , the effectiveness of using information extracted from the discourse to complete syntactic analysis of ill - formed sentences . after that",
    ", we propose an algorithm for completing incomplete parses by using discourse information , and give the results of an experiment on completing incomplete parses in technical documents .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have proposed a method for completing partial parses of ill - formed sentences on the basis of information extracted from complete parses of well - formed sentences in the discourse .",
    "our approach to handling ill - formed sentences is fundamentally different from previous ones in that it reanalyzes the part of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships of each word in an ill - formed sentence by using information extracted from analyses of other sentences in the same text , thus , attempting to generate the analysis most appropriate to the discourse .",
    "the results of our experiments show the effectiveness of this method ; moreover , implementation of this method on a machine translation system improved the accuracy of its translation . since this method has a simple framework that does not require any extra knowledge resources or inference mechanisms , it is robust and suitable for a practical natural language processing system . furthermore , in terms of the turn - around time ( tat ) of the whole translation procedure , the improvement in the parses achieved by using this method along with other disambiguation methods involving discourse information , as shown in another paper @xcite , shortened the tat in the late stages of the translation procedure , and compensated for the extra tat required as a result of using the discourse information , provided the size of the discourse was kept to between 100 and 300 sentences .    in this paper ,",
    "the term `` discourse '' is used as a set of words in a text together with the usage of each of those words in that text  namely , a part of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships with other words . the basic idea of our method is to improve the accuracy of sentence analysis simply by maintaining consistency in the usage of morphologically identical words within the same text .",
    "thus , the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the source text , since it presupposes that morphologically identical words are likely to be repeated in the same text .",
    "however , the results have been encouraging at least with technical documents such as computer manuals , where words with the same lemma are frequently repeated in a small area of text .",
    "moreover , our method improves the translation accuracy , especially for frequently repeated phrases , which are usually considered to be important , and leads to an improvement in the overall accuracy of the natural language processing system .",

    "<S> in a consistent text , many words and phrases are repeatedly used in more than one sentence . </S>",
    "<S> when an identical phrase ( a set of consecutive words ) is repeated in different sentences , the constituent words of those sentences tend to be associated in identical modification patterns with identical parts of speech and identical modifiee - modifier relationships . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when a syntactic parser can not parse a sentence as a unified structure , parts of speech and modifiee - modifier relationships among morphologically identical words in complete parses of other sentences within the same text provide useful information for obtaining partial parses of the sentence .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a method for completing partial parses by maintaining consistency among morphologically identical words within the same text as regards their part of speech and their modifiee - modifier relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results obtained by using this method with technical documents offer good prospects for improving the accuracy of sentence analysis in a broad - coverage natural language processing system such as a machine translation system . </S>"
