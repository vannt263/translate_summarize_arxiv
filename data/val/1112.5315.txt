    "according to the recycling scenario ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) , millisecond radio pulsars are produced by spin - up of the neutron stars ( nss ) via transfer of angular momentum through accretion in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . during this phase , channeled accretion of plasma along the ns magnetic field lines can produce x - ray pulsations that reveal the spin frequency of the accreting ns .",
    "a confirmation of this scenario came with the discovery of the first accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 , spinning at a frequency of about 401 hz @xcite .",
    "thirteen more accreting millisecond pulsars have been discovered so far with spin frequencies ranging from about 180 up to 600 hz .    in 2010 october",
    "the new accreting pulsar igr j17480 - 2446 has been discovered in the globular cluster terzan 5 @xcite . @xcite",
    "localized the source in outburst with _",
    "observations and identified it with a previously known candidate quiescent lmxb , named cx25 in the x - ray source catalog of @xcite .",
    "the source is in core of terzan 5 , one of the densest among globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the accreting pulsar spins with a frequency of 11 hz and the lmxb has a period of 21.3 hr around a companion with mass @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although this pulsar is not a millisecond one , its location in a globular cluster makes it a unique system whose properties are of particular importance to study the recycling mechanism .",
    "igr j174802446 is different from the other five known slow accreting pulsars in lmxbs ( 4u 1626@xmath467 , 2a 1822@xmath4371 , gro 1744 - 28 , gx 1 + 4 and her x-1 ) with properties which are in between those systems and the accreting millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "slow accreting pulsars are a very heterogeneous group of lmxbs , with white dwarf , main sequence and giant companions and orbital periods ranging from less than 1 hr to more than 11 days .",
    "despite this , the five slow pulsars have a high magnetic field @xmath5 and do not show thermonuclear bursts .",
    "this high @xmath6 field is difficult to reconcile with the long lifetime of these slow systems , and several scenarios have been proposed ( see , for example , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "igr j174802446 instead shows thermonuclear bursts ( @xcite , @xcite ) with burst oscillations phase locked with the accretion powered pulsations @xcite , and the @xmath6 field has been constrained to be in the range @xmath7 g ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all these field estimates point toward a mildly recycled pulsar , since accreting millisecond pulsars have shown so far field strengths of the order of @xmath8 g ( in agreement with the @xmath6 fields of radio millisecond pulsars ) .",
    "phase locking between burst oscillations and accretion powered pulsations has also been observed in at least one accreting millisecond pulsar ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the 11 hz rotation rate is , however , still unusually slow for an old ns , the typical rotation periods for accreting or rotation powered pulsars in globular clusters and old stellar populations being in the millisecond range .",
    "the reason for old nss possessing dipole magnetic fields smaller by about three orders of magnitude from the typical @xmath9 fields of young nss has elicited several explanations involving binary evolution .",
    "the burial of the field under accreted material has been proposed as a viable mechanism to dissipate the field via ohmic decay in the heated ns crust ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism , however , has a dramatic consequence for the final magnetic field : as the accreted matter keeps falling on the ns surface , the magnetic field lines will be pushed to deeper ( and colder ) regions of the crust where the conductivity is much larger , thus freezing at the crust - core interface .",
    "this will leave a residual field that is compatible with the observed weak fields of millisecond pulsars .",
    "another particularly simple and elegant explanation relies on the superfluid - superconducting nature of the ns interior , requiring that the rotation is carried by quantized vortex lines in the neutron superfluid and the magnetic flux by quantized flux lines in the proton superconductor @xcite .",
    "spin down of the star is achieved by outward motion of the vortex lines , which inevitably entangle and drag flux lines with them .",
    "srinivasan et al .",
    "noted that many ns binary evolution scenarios have an early first mass transfer epoch when the companion , not yet filling its roche lobe , is losing mass by a stellar wind , some of which is captured by the ns in a weak quasi spherical accretion with low specific angular momentum .",
    "the ns will be spinning down in this epoch , thus reducing its dipole field in proportion to its rotation rate .",
    "the wind spin - down epoch ends when the companion fills its roche lobe .",
    "the ensuing disk accretion now starts to spin - up the ns .",
    "if igr j17480 - 2446 is a primordial binary , then its spin frequency is surprising low ( the globular cluster terzan 5 is about 12 gyr old , see @xcite ) and requires investigation to understand whether this is the consequence of a peculiar evolutionary history . at present igr j174802446 is likely to be in its spin - up epoch @xcite .",
    "the results reported by @xcite are however affected by the usual problem of x - ray timing noise in the pulse time of arrivals ( toas ) that when not taken properly into account might strongly affect the significance of the spin frequency derivatives ( see for example the case of the other three accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars in @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we will re - investigate the existence of a spin - up phase by taking into account the effect of timing noise .",
    "if the spin - up is confirmed , then the comparatively long spin period indicates either that igr j174802446 is at an exceptionally early phase of the spin - up epoch or that it is close to spin equilibrium , with an unusually long equilibrium period reflecting a magnetic field stronger than in most nss in lmxb .",
    "the aperiodic variability can also help to understand the peculiar behavior of the source .",
    "@xcite reported several quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at frequencies ranging from about 48 up to 815 hz .",
    "this sequence of frequencies make possible several alternative estimations of the inner disk radius at present .",
    "each such model gives an estimate of the dipole magnetic field , equilibrium rotation rate and expected spin - up rate .",
    "the location of igr j174802446 in the globular cluster terzan 5 allows also to place stronger constraints on the evolutionary history of the binary since only a narrow range of donor masses is allowed .",
    "the distance of the system is also constrained by the globular cluster and leads to a precise determination of the x - ray luminosity . in section  [ xray ]",
    "we describe the x - ray observations carried during the 2010 outburst , and in section  [ results ] we verify the existence of a spin - up phase . in section  [ evolution ]",
    "we present the evolutionary history of igr j174802446 .",
    "we discuss three distinct epochs : in the initial two the ns has been spun down first via magneto dipole radiation and then by wind accretion , whereas in the third epoch the ns is spun - up via accretion of mass provided by the donor in roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic moment of the ns through the earlier dipole and wind spin - down epochs is also discussed . in section  [ constraints ]",
    "we place further constraints on the binary parameters by using the available information on the globular cluster terzan 5 and the results of the evolutionary history .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in section  [ discussion ] and infer that igr j174802446 is in an exceptionally early rlof phase that explains why its spin frequency is still so small when compared to accreting millisecond pulsars .",
    "we reduced all pointed x - ray observations taken with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) by the proportional camera array  @xcite in event mode . only photons with energies between 2.5 and 15.6 kev are retained ( absolute channels 5@xmath437 ) .",
    "the time resolution of the observations is @xmath10 s ( for @xmath11 event data ) and @xmath12 s ( for good xenon data ) rebinned to @xmath10 s to make the data sampling uniform .",
    "the photons detected span an observing window between 2010 october 13 and november 19 .",
    "the total duration of the outburst is longer than the duration of the _ rxte _ observations , and it has been constrained to be @xmath13 days @xcite or even longer ( 77 days ) when modeling the outburst decay @xcite .      a previous coherent timing analysis of igr j174802446 is briefly described in @xcite , who reported a pulse frequency derivative of @xmath14 with errors calculated by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations that take into account the red noise in the timing residuals @xcite .",
    "the steps followed are those used in standard coherent timing of radio and x - ray pulsars : the photon arrival times are referred to the solar system barycenter using the optical position from @xcite , fine clock corrections are applied to the _ rxte _ data , and earth occultations and intervals of unstable pointing are filtered out .    to measure the toas of the persistent pulsations ,",
    "all bursts are removed from the light - curve , then @xmath15 to @xmath16 s long intervals of data are folded in profiles of @xmath17 bins with the preliminary ephemeris reported in @xcite . the length of the folded data segments is chosen to have a nearly uniform statistical error ( @xmath18ms ) for each toa .",
    "the @xmath19 profiles are those folded from the first _ rxte _ data - set ( obsid 95437 - 01 - 01 - 00 ) when the pulse profiles have the highest fractional amplitude and the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "all other observations are folded with @xmath20 s segments with the exact length slightly varying for each observation to assure that all good photons are retained in the data analysis .",
    "we assume that pulsations are detected in a profile if the ratio between the amplitude of a harmonic and its statistical error is larger than 3.5 .",
    "this guarantees that the expected number of false pulse detections is less than one in the entire data collection ( the total number of profiles is @xmath21 for each harmonic ) . a fundamental and two overtones are detected with strong significance and in enough data segments to allow a determination of a precise global timing solution .",
    "the toas of each harmonic are fitted using the tempo2 pulse timing program @xcite , assuming a circular keplerian orbit plus a pulse frequency and its first time derivative .",
    "the entire folding and fitting procedure is then repeated until the final timing solution converges .",
    "the orbital parameters are reported in table  [ tab1 ] along with @xmath22 error bars obtained by multiplying the statistical error as given by tempo2 by @xmath23 .",
    "the errors on the pulse frequency and its derivative are instead treated separately to include the strong effect of timing noise which operates on the same timescales over which the two parameters are measured .",
    "details of the procedure have been extensively discussed in the literature , and we refer to @xcite for the results obtained on igr j174802446 and to @xcite and @xcite for further details on the procedure .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    the values of the magnetic dipole moment are reported in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "if we take the ns to be already in equilibrium at the present spin frequency of 11 hz , then @xmath24 and a @xmath6 field at the poles of @xmath25 g where we have used : @xmath26 here @xmath27 takes account of the possibility that the observed frequency is not the _ kepler _ frequency but some related frequency at the disk boundary : e.g. , @xmath28 for the epicyclic frequency ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this uncertainty makes the field estimates somewhat higher .",
    "+ the torque applied by the accretion disk on the ns is usually assumed to be : @xmath29 with the dimensionless torque @xmath30 describing the dependence on the fastness parameter @xmath31 , is likely of the form @xmath32 with the exponent @xmath33 @xcite . if igr j174802446 is as yet at the beginning of its spin - up epoch , then @xmath34 , @xmath35 , giving constant @xmath36 and expected spin frequency derivatives @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ns moment of inertia in units of @xmath39 .",
    "these estimates of @xmath40 are also given in table  [ tab3 ] .",

    "the spin - up age up to the present is then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ( unknown ) duty cycle of the binary .",
    "if we assume @xmath46 , the maximum estimated time in the spin - up epoch up to now is @xmath47 yr corresponding to @xmath48 ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",

    "the ns is active as a pulsar until the magnetospheric voltage falls below a critical threshold ( the `` pulsar death line '' ) . for conventional radio",
    "pulsars the epoch of pulsar activity lasts for 10@xmath55 - 10@xmath56",
    "no evidence of magnetic field decay is seen in the pulsar population during this active epoch .",
    "the lower limit for an exponential decay time is 10@xmath56 yr .    if the magnetic dipole moment decayed in proportion to the rotation rate , due to flux - line vortex line coupling @xcite , @xmath57 the spin - down would follow a power law with braking index @xmath58 .",
    "more detailed considerations of flux - line motion indicates that the simple scaling in equation ( 12 ) is a likely to be a good description for the evolution  @xcite .",
    "the vortex - flux coupling leads to the decay of magnetic flux in the ns superfluid neutron - superconducting proton core . for the total dipole",
    "moment to decay , the flux expelled from the core must diffuse through the highly conducting crust .",
    "the decay time through the crust is estimated to be 10@xmath56 yr .",
    "this is supported by the limits on exponential decay of the dipole moment from population analysis of the radio pulsars .",
    "ongoing dipole spin - down on time scales much longer than 10@xmath56 yr , that is , beyond the typical duration of the epoch of radio pulsar emission , will be effected by the power law decay of the dipole moment due to flux - vortex coupling .",
    "whether pulsar activity has ceased or not , vacuum dipole spin - down will continue until the wind captured from the companion penetrates the light cylinder .",
    "the captured wind loses angular momentum in a shock and will accrete towards the ns down to a stopping radius @xmath59 .",
    "the wind will be able to affect the torque on the neutron star when @xmath60 with @xmath61 denoting the wind _ captured _ by the ns .",
    "after this point , spin - down will proceed under the effect of the inflowing wind . from equation ( [ windt ] ) the rotation rate @xmath62 at the beginning of the wind spin - down epoch is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass inflow rate arriving at @xmath65 in units of @xmath66 g s@xmath52 .",
    "if we first assume that flux - vortex coupling has no effect , the dipole spin - down proceeds with a constant dipole moment and braking index 3 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the speed of light and @xmath69 is the ns moment of inertia .",
    "the duration of the dipole spin - down epoch , until the rotation rate @xmath62 is reached is given by @xmath70 where we have used equations ( [ omega1 ] ) and ( [ nudot ] ) and @xmath71 . in the last line of equation ( [ n3 ] ) we have assumed that the magnetic field does not decay during the dipole spin - down epoch , so that the dipole moment @xmath72 at the end of this epoch is still the dipole moment @xmath73 of the ns at birth . since the lifetime thus obtained is not much smaller than the crust diffusion timescale of 10@xmath56 yr , it might be necessary to take the vortex - flux coupling and the induced decay of the dipole magnetic moment into account .",
    "the correct estimate of dipole spin - down epoch , incorporating flux decay according to equation ( [ mu ] ) proceeds with braking index 5 .",

    "if one ignores the field decay and assumes a typical @xmath80 in equation ( [ n3 ] ) then the dipole spin down age is @xmath81 yr .",
    "wind accretion ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) proceeds by bondi - hoyle like capture of material from the companion s wind , which is then channeled toward the ns by outward transport of angular momentum in traversing a shock front . the wind mass loss rate from a @xmath82 main sequence companion is @xmath83 , which is low when compared to the present day mass accretion rate , driven by rlof . even considering a sub - giant phase of a @xmath82 donor star , the wind loss rate will increase only slightly , reaching @xmath84 for sub - giant stars ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "only a fraction of this wind will be captured to flow towards the ns , with @xmath85 as low as @xmath86 @xcite . however , since the orbit of igr j174802446 shows stringent upper limits on the eccentricity ( @xmath87 , @xcite ) tidal circularization has probably already taken place and it is likely that the donor star is rotating synchronously with the orbit , since the circularization timescale is typically larger than the synchronization timescale ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the large rotation of the donor ( @xmath88 ) can boost the wind loss rate by a large factor of the order of @xmath89 when compared with typical isolated stars of similar mass at the same evolutionary stage .",
    "the captured wind might be therefore comparably higher , with values of @xmath90 .",
    "the ns is spinning rapidly within this wind of low specific angular momentum .",
    "for our purposes of estimating the duration of the spin - down epoch it will be enough to take a constant torque , giving the spin - down rate : @xmath91    using equations ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ mu1 ] ) one can find the spin - down in wind and field decay solutions @xmath92 + since the magnetic moment does not change after the wind spin - down epoch , @xmath93 at the end of the wind spin - down epoch is just the magnetic moment in the present rlof spin - up epoch as estimated above . by assuming that @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ", we obtain @xmath96    where we have assumed that @xmath97 as found at the end of the previous section .    from the calculations presented in equation ( [ sd ] )",
    "we see that for a captured wind of @xmath98 , the spin - down epoch lasts for a time @xmath99yr , much shorter than the age of the cluster ( @xmath100yr ) for an assumed @xmath101 .",
    "if more wind is accreted , as described for example in the focused accretion model of @xcite , the wind spin - down epoch would be further shortened if the wind still carries low angular momentum .",
    "if the wind has instead large angular momentum because it is focused through the lagrangian point @xmath102 , the rlof epoch would be further shortened .      in the previous section",
    "we have seen that igr j174802446 is not close to equilibrium since it exhibits a strong spin - up during the outburst .",
    "several other considerations on the evolutionary history of igr j174802446 also suggest that the ns is currently spinning up . according to the spin evolution history",
    ", the present 11 hz spin frequency does not represent a special frequency .",
    "it remains to be explained whether the conclusion that the binary has currently completed only the first few million years since the onset of the rlof , a phase which lasts for @xmath103 yr , requires any special pleading .",
    "if we assume that the observed spin - up and outburst duration represent the typical values of an outburst of igr j174802446 , then the pulsar spins up by @xmath104 at each outburst , where @xmath105 is the outburst length ( 55 days ) . if the ns is dominated by magneto dipole spin - down during quiescence , as proposed for some accreting millisecond pulsars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) then a balance of the spin - up requires a magnetic field @xmath106 and a recurrence time of @xmath107 yr to provide a spin - down with the necessary magnitude calculated via the expression @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the offset angle between the rotational and magnetic field axes .",
    "the spin down would then be of the order of @xmath110 .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ intro ] , different estimates of the @xmath6 field of igr j174802446 suggest @xmath111 g . such a @xmath6 value requires a recurrence time of @xmath112 yr which is not compatible with a binary evolution scenario with the donor in an rlof phase",
    ". the mass transfer rate ( equal to the outburst mass accretion rate averaged over the source duty cycle ) would then average to @xmath113 , a value too small for an evolved donor or even a main sequence star with @xmath114 ( typical values being @xmath115 ) .",
    "the mass function of igr j174802446 has been reported in @xcite and corresponds to a minimum donor mass of 0.4@xmath116 for a neutron star of @xmath117 .",
    "the location of igr j174802446 in the globular cluster terzan 5 allows to place further constraints on the donor mass .",
    "terzan 5 is composed by two populations of stars : one with sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) and one with supra - solar metallicity ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "one interpretation of these discrepant metallicities and helium abundances is that the cluster is composed by two different populations of stars with ages of @xmath122 gyr ( metal poor ) and @xmath123 gyr ( metal rich ) .",
    "if we assume that the donor star belongs to the first population , strong constraints can be placed on the donor star . since the orbital period of igr j174802446 is @xmath124 hr , and assuming a minimum ns mass of 1.2@xmath125 , the minimum orbital separation of the system is @xmath126 au . by using the roche lobe approximation of @xcite : @xmath127 with @xmath128 being the ratio of the donor and accretor mass , the minimum possible roche lobe radius that corresponds to the minimum orbital separation and the minimum mass ratio ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) is 1.1@xmath131 .",
    "after 12 gyr all stars with a mass @xmath132 have evolved to the red giant phase and might have already turned into white dwarfs whereas all stars with @xmath133 ( i.e. , the turn off mass of the metal - poor population of terzan 5 , @xcite ) are still on the main sequence . considering the other extreme case of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , the maximum roche lobe radius will be 1.8@xmath131 .    to fill the roche lobe therefore",
    "any possible donor star of igr j174802446 has to be an evolved star that has left the main sequence and has increased its radius to fit its roche lobe .",
    "the donor star mass falls in the range @xmath136 and is likely to be a sub - giant .",
    "this result strongly constrains the orbital separation of the system to be in the range @xmath137-@xmath138 au for a total mass of the binary between 2.1 ( @xmath139 ns and 0.9@xmath125 donor ) and 3@xmath125 ( @xmath140 ns and @xmath141 donor ) . the inclination @xmath142 of the binary is then constrained by using the projected semi - major axis of igr j174802446 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) : @xmath143 identical considerations apply if the donor star belongs to the metal rich population , with the difference that the turn off mass will be higher by a few tenths of solar mass and the inclination smaller by a few degrees .",
    "all these considerations assume that irradiation of the donor star is unimportant in determining its radius .",
    "this is a good assumption given that non - negligible irradiation sets in with the onset of rlof and we have seen that this phase has lasted for @xmath144 yr . therefore any possible donor star has filled the roche lobe following a standard evolutionary path that does not involve irradiation of the outer envelope .",
    "the effect of irradiation might instead be important during the rlof phase when the outermost layers of the envelope expand after absorbing the energy deposited by the x - ray radiation .",
    "the star being constrained to fit the roche lobe will increase its mass loss through the inner lagrangian point and boost the mass transfer rate . the average x - ray power absorbed by the companion during an outburst is @xmath145 with @xmath146 being the average x - ray luminosity during an outburst . given a duty cycle of @xmath147 , the long term average power absorbed by the donor will be @xmath148 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath149 of the outgoing power produced by a low mass stars in the sub - giant branch and can not be considered negligible .",
    "the quantitative effect of irradiation can be calculated with stellar evolutionary codes and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we have investigated the evolutionary history of igr j174802446 discussing three distinct evolutionary epochs : a dipole dominated spin - down epoch , a wind epoch and the currently observed rlof phase . by taking into account the effect of timing noise in the x - ray pulsations we are able to confirm the long - term average spin - up of @xmath150 observed during the 2010 outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the x - ray flux represents most of the bolometric flux , the short term spin frequency derivatives @xmath40 do not scale with the x - ray flux in the expected way .",
    "the long - term @xmath40 , however , leads to exclude a scenario in which igr j174802446 has already reached spin equilibrium .",
    "a long - term spin equilibrium with magnetic dipole spin down in quiescence balancing the accretion torques in outburst is also excluded based on binary evolution considerations .",
    "the spin - up timescale suggests that igr j174802446 has been spun - up in the rlof phase for a few @xmath151 yr .",
    "an interpretation of the observed qpos as the equilibrium frequencies of igr j174802446 indicates a similar timescale for the spin - up epoch up to the present .",
    "the spin - down epochs suggest that the ns in igr j174802446 had reached a spin frequency of the order of @xmath152hz at the onset of the rlof phase , if we assume that the newborn nss had typical initial values for @xmath75 and @xmath73 .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the time elapsed in rlof has been very short , since the time required to spin - up a 1 hz ns to 11 hz with a spin frequency derivative of @xmath153 and a duty cycle of 0.01 is a few @xmath1yr .",
    "based on these findings we conclude that igr j174802446 is in an exceptionally early rlof phase .",
    "the total spin - up timescale to transform igr j174802446 from a slow pulsar ( @xmath154 ) into a millisecond one ( @xmath155 ) is @xmath156yr .",
    "since the current rlof phase will last for @xmath103yr , we would expect to observe today @xmath157 accreting millisecond pulsars that have followed a similar evolutionary history as igr j174802446 .",
    "the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1748.9 - 2021 ( @xmath158 ) in the globular cluster ngc 6440 has a companion with mass and orbital period compatible with being in a slightly evolved post main sequence phase @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the companion of sax j1748.9 - 2021 has followed an evolutionary history similar to igr j174802446 with the difference that it spent a longer time in the rlof phase thus turning its ns into a millisecond pulsar .",
    "the scenario outlined above is compatible with the observed population of accreting pulsars , although it is difficult to assess the problem in a robust way given the small number statistics .",
    "it is also possible that dynamical interactions have played a role by decreasing the number of similar systems in globular clusters via ionization interactions .",
    "this however requires further investigations along with detailed binary evolution calculations .",
    "the prior spin - down history gives results which are not compatible with a binary having an age of several @xmath159 yr as expected if igr j174802446 is primordial or if it has not suffered exchange interactions in the last few @xmath159 yr .",
    "different formation scenarios are available to explain the apparent discrepancy between the age of the cluster and the binary .",
    "a first possibility is that a recent dynamical encounter has played a role in forming the binary or in accelerating the onset of the rlof phase .",
    "if an exchange interaction has taken place in the last few @xmath160 yr then this would explain why the apparent age of igr j174802446 is so short compared with the age of the cluster .",
    "the location of igr j174802446 in the high mass and high central density cluster terzan 5 suggests that the interaction rate might be particularly high in this environment .",
    "dynamical simulations to calculate the typical interaction rates in the core of terzan 5 are required to assess this question .",
    "a second possibility for the origin of igr j174802446 is formation of the accreting pulsar via accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a massive white dwarf ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "a onemg white dwarf accretes matter until its mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit and it collapses to form an ns via electron captures on mg and ne nuclei . in this case the binary must have gone through a preliminary contact phase during which the white dwarf was accreting from a donor star in rlof . during the collapse approximately 0.2@xmath125 are ejected from the binary ( see for example @xcite for a discussion ) which causes a sudden expansion of the orbit turning the system into a detached binary . at this point",
    "the binary follows the three evolutionary epochs described in section  [ evolution ] with the ns age set by the onset of aic .",
    "the formation of nss from aic has been discussed by @xcite to explain the young radio pulsar population in globular clusters .",
    "lyne et al .",
    "note that the formation rate of young pulsars in globular clusters is larger than that of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters .",
    "the young pulsars are found in metal rich globular clusters with high mass and high central densities , like terzan 5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence that globular clusters might contain young nss was also presented by @xcite , who reported the discovery of the youngest millisecond pulsar ever found in the globular cluster ngc 6624 , with a characteristic age @xmath161 myr ( see also @xcite and @xcite on the `` young '' millisecond pulsar psr 1821 - 24a in the globular cluster m28 ) .",
    "we can therefore speculate that a similar evolutionary process has taken place for igr j174802446 thus explaining the relatively short lifetime of the ns through the dipole and wind spin - down and present rlof spin - up epochs .",
    "a possible test for the aic scenario can be performed by measuring the gravitational mass of the ns in igr j174802446 . since",
    "the rlof phase has lasted for a very short time , the ns mass is currently almost identical to the value expected from the aic scenario , which is @xmath162 .",
    "a gravitational ns mass larger than this value would immediately rule out the aic scenario ."
