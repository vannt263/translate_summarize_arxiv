    "rothe _ et al_. @xcite have recently presented experimental evidence for `` violation of the exponential decay - law at long times '' .",
    "deviations from exponential decay of an unstable quantum system had been predicted long ago as a result of the semiboundedness of the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the transition into the non - exponential regime at long times occurs in most decaying systems after many lifetimes , where the minute survival probability had previously frustrated verification .",
    "in addition , it had been argued that interaction with the environment and/or the measurement process would suppress the long time deviation @xcite .",
    "et al_. measured the decay of luminescence of various dissolved organic molecules after pulsed laser excitation . the results clearly show a range of times over which the decay of the survival probability @xmath0 is exponential , followed by another where it is algebraic , @xmath1 .",
    "one puzzling aspect of the experimental results of rothe _",
    "et al_. @xcite is that their inferred algebraic exponents @xmath2 are patently non - integral , except in one case ( ptoep , frozen solution ) , for which @xmath3 .",
    "other values range from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "these non - integer exponents are in sharp contrast to theoretical studies of long - time deviation from exponential decay which predict or postulate integral exponents for the algebraic decay @xcite .    reacting to this apparent contradiction",
    ", we explore physical mechanisms which could lead to long - time deviations from exponential decay with arbitrary , non - integer power law exponents . on the mathematical side ,",
    "an `` explanation '' of an arbitrary power - law exponent follows from the expression for the survival amplitude in terms of an energy density @xmath6 . as defined in section ii , a(t)= _ 0^de ( e )  e^-iet/ , [ eq : z1 ] where we have assumed no bound states and an energy threshold at @xmath7",
    ". the large - time asymptotics depend on the behaviour of @xmath6 near the origin @xcite .",
    "in fact , under mild conditions on @xmath6 as a function of the complex variable @xmath8 , @xmath9 as @xmath10 if @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "this implies @xmath13 .",
    "from this perspective , non - integer values of the exponent @xmath14 are the consequence of an appropriate non - integer @xmath15 in the threshold density of states .    by itself , this formal argument is not satisfying since it tells us nothing about the physical mechanism behind the threshold behaviour of @xmath6 .",
    "we would like to learn , from the properties of the hamiltonian or possibly of the initial state , the origin of such exponents , or , equivalently , the threshold behaviour of the energy distribution .",
    "at this point we refrain from attempting a very general approach valid for the plethora of unstable systems with exponential decay at intermediate times .",
    "in particular , the process of excitonic decay in dissolved organic molecules is poorly understood , and present models explain only qualitatively the processes that lead to their emission spectra @xcite .",
    "hence we take refuge in a physical domain where full or sufficiently accurate analytical and numerical methods are available , namely , the decay of a wavepacket in a spherically symmetric potential well , in a given partial wave .",
    "this is done with the hope that the lessons learned here may be useful elsewhere , although there is no guarantee that our results can be extended to such diverse fields as auto - ionizing states , photo - ionization , particle physics or spontaneous photon emission , because of the particular constructions of their distributions @xmath6 .",
    "one of the advantages of the decay of unstable states in 1d and spherically symmetric 3d potential models is that it is a well studied subject , reviewed by fonda , ghirardi and rimini some time ago @xcite .",
    "the conditions leading to integer exponents are well understood .",
    "if the initial unstable state has angular momentum @xmath16 and the potential is `` well behaved '' at short and large distances , then the algebraic exponent is generally @xmath17 . in particular , for the most studied case of @xmath18-waves , @xmath19 ; the @xmath20 contribution would be in any case the dominant one at very large times since it is the slowest decaying term .",
    "this algebraic decay law also applies in 1d decaying systems @xcite",
    ". the derivation of these integral power laws will facilitate identification of the complementary cases in which the exponents may be non - integers , so we shall devote section ii to a review of the basic elements of potential scattering theory relevant for our purposes .",

    "the predicted algebraic exponent varies continuously with @xmath26 , with @xmath27 when @xmath28 corresponding to a short range potential .",
    "this is shown in detail in section iii , for a potential model with inverse square tail in which @xmath6 is obtained analytically , and the conditions for the validity of the simple prediction for the algebraic exponent can be easily studied . in the final discussion we comment on the experimental feasibility of inverse square interactions .",
    "we consider a system that is initially in a normalized non - stationary state @xmath29 .",

    "we disregard these exceptional possibilities and concentrate on the generic case @xmath56 .",
    "the main properties of concern for the long - time behaviour of the survival probability are analyticity of @xmath46 in the complex @xmath57-plane , its asymptotic behaviour near the origin ( the same as the ricatti - bessel function ) and at infinity @xcite , |_(k , r)| _ ( ) ^+1e^|im kr| , [ eq : z13 ] where @xmath58 is some constant , and the behaviour of the jost function at @xmath55 and at infinity .",

    "@xmath199 for equally spaced values of @xmath30 in the above range .",
    "the fits are always excellent , so that in that range of times one can hardly distinguish in the figures the exact @xmath0 from the fitted form @xmath200 .",
    "the effective algebraic exponents , @xmath201 , thus found are shown in figure [ fidr4 ] .",
    "one sees that when @xmath202 the effective exponents depend on the parameters of the potential , and deviate from the simple law @xmath203 . making the barrier wider or higher , increases the values of @xmath201 for a given @xmath26 , but in all cases as @xmath180 one finds that the values of @xmath201 become constant .",
    "we tried to derive explicit analytic expressions for @xmath0 in the limit @xmath204 . using only the first order term in the expansion of the neumann function , @xmath205 , the first term in the asymptotic series for @xmath163 goes like @xmath206 $ ] with the next order terms involving higher powers of the logarithm .",
    "however , using only the first order term of the series for @xmath207 is not enough ; one needs at least one more term in both @xmath208 and @xmath207 . with these added terms",
    ", we were unable to find a useful analytic expression for @xmath163 .",
    "still , the fact that the lowest order results include @xmath199 and powers thereof indicates that the algebraic form of decay for the asymptotic part of @xmath0 is not as universal as previously thought .",
    "it is only for potentials with a vanishing or repulsive outer part that such a simple algebraic decay law can be established .",
    "our study of the long - time deviations from exponential decay , was motivated by the apparent contradiction between the recent ( and so far only ) experimental results which unambiguously show such deviations , and theoretical models : the power laws in the experiments have non - integer exponents whereas the models predict or postulate integers . what is the physical origin of non - integral exponents ?",
    "the complexity of the system studied experimentally ( large , excited organic molecules in solution ) , made us consider , instead of an _ ab initio _ or realistic approach , the more modest goal of understanding and answering the question in a tractable system .    limiting ourselves to a single - particle model of wave - packet decay from a scattering potential region ,",
    "we have established a link between non - integer exponents and long potential tails , which is expressed by a simple formula for repulsive inverse square potentials . before arriving at these results we explored several other possible sources of `` anomalous '' long - time decay",
    ": in particular , we tried to simulate the effects of the solvent molecules and of temperature by introducing randomly fluctuating perturbations in the potential and averaging over many realizations .",
    "this lead to localization effects and a non - vanishing constant value of @xmath0 at long times but non - integral exponents were not found .",
    "another attempt was consideration of complex potentials that could simulate the effect of coupled channels due to measurement or other effects .",
    "however the result of an imaginary term is similar to that described in @xcite , eq . (",
    "11 ) : the long - time deviation is altered but not in the sought for algebraic form .    despite our retreat from the arena of the organic molecule experiments ,",
    "the long - time decay described here is not simply academic .",
    "attractive inverse square potentials occur physically as effective radial potentials between a charged wire and a polarizable neutral atom @xcite , the strength factor being proportional to the square of the linear charge density of the wire and thus controllable @xcite .",
    "combined with a repulsive centrifugal term , an arbitrary @xmath209 potential may be implemented .",
    "in addition , it is possible to modify the inner region and implement a potential minimum by a time varying sinusoidal voltage in the high frequency limit @xcite , or by replacing the wire by a charged optical fiber with blue detuned light propagating along the fiber and the cladding removed @xcite .",
    "decay experiments with cold atoms showing exponential laws have been performed @xcite , and the ability to modify the potential parameters makes the observation and study of the long - time power - law in these systems a realistic prospect .",

    "the riccati - bessel functions @xmath210 , and @xmath211 are defined as @xmath168 times the corresponding spherical functions , or , in terms of cylindrical bessel and neumann functions , @xmath212 in this paper @xmath26 may be non - integer .",
    "we will prove here that the energy density extended to the quarter circle at infinity , in the fourth quadrant of the energy plane , is vanishingly small and therefore does not contribute to @xmath214 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z36 ] ) . to do so ,",
    "we first rewrite the energy density as @xmath215 we will now extend these functions to the fourth quadrant in the energy plane and look at their asymptotic behaviour when @xmath216 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "similarly we will write @xmath219 and will now find an approximate expression for the latter valid in the limit when @xmath220 . from @xmath221 , we can write @xmath222 similarly , since @xmath223 , @xmath224 in the same limit , the sine in the numerator of @xmath225 will give @xmath226 since im@xmath227 .",
    "let us now consider the denominator : from eq .",
    "( [ eq : z23 ] ) one sees that both the ricatti - bessel functions and the regular solutions at @xmath74 must be extended to complex energies in the fourth quadrant and in the large @xmath228 limit . using the asymptotic expansions given e.g. in @xcite , we find @xmath229 with @xmath230 . inserting these into eq .",
    "( [ eq : z23 ] ) we find to order @xmath231 @xmath232 now one has to deal with @xmath233 and @xmath234 , whose explicit expressions are given in eqs .",
    "[ eq : z28 ] . using the approximations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zb3 ] , [ eq : zb4 ] ) and ( [ eq : zb5 ] ) , one finds @xmath235 so that all terms in the denominator of @xmath225 diverge like @xmath236 . since the @xmath237 in the numerator diverges only like exp@xmath238 ,",
    "( [ eq : zb5 ] ) , the result is that @xmath239 and therefore the contribution to @xmath214 due to the integral on the quarter circle at infinity is nil .",
    "note that this result can be easily extended to any value of @xmath120 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z25 ] ) .",
