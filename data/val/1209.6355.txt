    "the nature of the dynamics in coupled nonlinear systems is a central issue of interest in a number of areas of scientific enquiry .",
    "a variety of natural phenomena  ranging from the motion of pendulums or springs , to lasers , fluid flow , ecological systems , populations , and so on  are modeled as oscillators .",
    "these may be linear or nonlinear , depending on the context , and as is well known , the motion can be periodic or chaotic .",
    "when systems that are in isolation capable of complex behaviour are coupled , a host of novel phenomena can be seen .",
    "these depend both upon the properties of the isolated systems  the nature of the nonlinearity , whether the motion is chaotic or regular , what are the equilibria , and so on  as well as the manner in which their coupling is organized .",
    "an important _ emergent _ phenomenon in this context is the suppression of oscillations , formally termed _ amplitude death _ ( ad ) : as a consequence of the interaction oscillations of the entire system cease , leading to stationarity @xcite .",
    "such behaviour is emergent in the sense that the isolated or uncoupled systems do not exhibit stationary dynamics . in a formal sense ,",
    "amplitude death is an instance of a more general phenomenon that includes both the cessation of oscillations as a consequence of coupling , as well the suppression of amplitude _ variations _ , namely the conversion of chaotic oscillations to periodic or quasiperiodic dynamics . in a sense , this is the stabilization or creation of `` simpler '' attractors through the coupling .",
    "when oscillations stop , there are two possibilities for ad .",
    "if the coupled systems have exactly one equilibrium , then the occurrence of  implies that this equilibrium becomes asymptotically stable .",
    "however , the coupled systems can have more than one stationary state and then one can have the stabilization of new fixed points , namely those that are not stable ( or may not even exist ) in the uncoupled system .",
    "a general setting in which we discuss ad in this review is a configuration of @xmath0 coupled nonlinear oscillators that is specified by the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the @xmath4-dimensional vector of dynamical variables for the @xmath5th oscillator , and the @xmath6 s specify their evolution equations .",
    "the oscillators may be identical or distinct , and are coupled to other oscillators , as specified via the function @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a normalization factor , @xmath9 is the coupling strength , and the connection topology is specified by the connectivity matrix , whose elements @xmath10 are 1 or 0 , depending on whether oscillators @xmath5 and @xmath11 are coupled with each other or not .",
    "the actual coupling is specified by the term @xmath12 which is a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the time ",

    "the transient dynamics is essentially that of damped oscillations , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : model ] ( b ) and ( c ) . as can be seen ,",
    "although this is an amplitude phenomenon , there could be additional effects that involve the phases of the oscillators , and indeed , any analytic understanding of this phenomenon must include a discussion of both the amplitudes and the phases of the interacting systems .",
    ".1 cm    there are some terminological issues that need to be clarified . in this article",
    "we will term the cessation of oscillations , regardless of what fixed points are stabilized asymptotically , as amplitude death , even though the asymptotic steady states in the different subsystems may not be the same ( as for example in fig .",

    "what these fixed points are will naturally depend on the internal structure of the individual oscillators , whether they are identical or mismatched , whether the coupling is symmetric or asymmetric , and indeed what the nature of the coupling is , namely whether the interactions are diffusive or nonlinear .",
    "following the initial work by bar - eli @xcite ad has been studied quite extensively @xcite .",
    "different situations where  occurs have been described , and it is now known that the phenomenon can be seen when the interacting systems are identical @xcite , mismatched @xcite , when the coupling is dynamical @xcite , or nonlinear ( nondiffusive ) @xcite .",

    "there are also other situations where oscillations need to be maintained , as for instance in brain functioning @xcite .",
    "these different requirements suggest that control strategies to either to achieve or to avoid ad in coupled systems are necessary , and in sec . [ target ]",
    "we review some control methods that have been employed to either target or avoid steady states in coupled systems .",
    "as indicated above , understanding the transient dynamics is important in describing ad since this state is asymptotically featureless .",
    "transient dynamics can be significant in many applications that are restricted to finite times , as for example in ecology @xcite . furthermore , since the different subsystems are coupled , a study of the synchronization properties @xcite is also of interest . in a number of examples",

    "this scenario for the occurrence of ad in delay  coupled systems is quite general and does not depend on the nature of the dynamics in the uncoupled systems .",
    "as was shown by prasad @xcite , even chaotic oscillators can be stabilized in this manner .",
    "the importance of time delay interactions has been highlighted in @xcite .    given a finite transmission speed for signals from one subsystem to reach the other ,",
    "a natural extension is to consider the situation when the time  delay itself varies .",
    "this is particularly important when there are stochastic effects that are being modeled by the delay itself .",
    "atay @xcite considered the effect of a distribution of time  delays and showed that even a small spread in the delay distribution can greatly enlarge the set of parameters for which amplitude death occurs .",
    "the expansion of the ad region with a distribution of delays is a important effect with a wide range of applications @xcite , particularly since if the variance of the distribution is above a threshold , this ad region can become unbounded . again , the effect is quite general , occurring for arbitrary spread in the delay , for different forms of the distribution , and for arbitrary numbers of oscillators @xcite .",
    "closely related to the case of distributed delays is the situation where systems respond to cumulative signals , namely by integrating information received over an interval in time .",
    "this occurs when systems have a finite intrinsic response time and also causes the region of ad to extend indefinitely @xcite .    since time ",
    "delay interactions are common in experiments , various aspects of both fixed and distributed delays , including a deterministic time - varying interaction @xcite have been studied .",
    "one application is to the stabilization of fixed points @xcite .",
    "velocity delayed coupling has been also explored in the context of  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : velocity ] ) .",

    "delays in different directions ( to model spatial heterogeneity @xcite and one - way ring time - delay @xcite have been studied in recent works .",
    "a novel context for   is when systems are coupled via so  called conjugate or dissimilar variables . with such coupling ,",
    "the necessity for systems being either mismatched or having time  delayed interactions can be dropped , and ad occurs in identical systems with instantaneous coupling .",
    "this was first studied in a model system by karnatak  @xcite who considered two landau  stuart oscillators with the evolution equations @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and similar equations can be written for subsystem 2 . note that here the @xmath25 variable of the second oscillator is diffusively coupled to the @xmath24 variable of the first oscillator and vice versa .",
    "coupling via conjugate variables is natural in a variety of experimental situations , and indeed the above system was inspired by the experiments of kim and roy @xcite on coupled semiconductor laser systems where the photon intensity fluctuations from one laser were used to modulate the injection current of a second identical laser and vice versa .",
    "indeed it would not be possible to couple two lasers through their intensity fluctuations directly .",
    "as it happens , in a model of the semiconductor laser , the current and the fluctuations are , in a sense , conjugate variables that have constitute the chaotic oscillator system @xcite .",
    "the largest three lyapunov exponents for the above system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rajat1 ] , and as can be seen , there is a wide range of coupling strength where all s are negative , indicating stabilization of the fixed point .",
    "a transient trajectories are shown in the inset .",
    "a detailed analytical condition for the occurrence of   can be found in @xcite . with conjugate coupling",
    ", ad can be anticipated by recognizing that there is a strong analogy between time  delayed and conjugate variables : as a matter of fact , the takens embedding theorem @xcite asserts that the topological properties of a dynamical system that is reconstructed through delay variables match those of the true system for appropriate choices of embedding dimension and time delay .",
    "thus using conjugate variables is akin to using time ",
    "delay coupling , and this gives rise to regimes of ad .",
    "in addition , there are other new features such as the suppression of chaos , and riddling @xcite due to conjugate coupling .",
    "in addition , this is particularly suited to experiments and both in electrochemical systems @xcite as well as in electronic circuits @xcite , this coupling can be realized .",

    "the form of the coupling has been taken to be linear or diffusive .",
    "an interesting extension that uses nonlinear coupling makes it possible to not only achieve ad , but also to specify the steady state of the coupled system @xcite .",

    "we have found that the phenomenon of   when systems are coupled through nonlinear interactions is very general and occurs in the absence of parameter mismatch , in the absence of time  delay ( although time delay can enhance the effect ) @xcite .",
    "a final scenario we discuss dispenses with the need that the interacting oscillators be similar .",

    "ad is quite robust with regard to noise since the lyapunov exponents of systems undergoing ad are substantially negative ; the systems are deep in the region of stability .",
    "thus ad has been observed in numerous experiments many of which have been discussed here .",
    "this aspect deserved further study , however , since it is not clear to what extent inhomogeneous steady states can be perturbed by noise ( after @xmath165 in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] ) .",
    "in addition , the study of network is currently of great importance in various areas of study and as we have seen , ad in complex systems with different topologies is of interest .",
    "the chimeric state of partial amplitude death is , in particular , an important one that needs further exploration .",
    "although there has been substantial work on amplitude death , several challenges remain both at fundamental as well as applications levels . through this review",
    "we have tried to summarize the current state of understanding of the phenomenon , as well as drawn attention to several open issues , and to highlight possible applications .",
