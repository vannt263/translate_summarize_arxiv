    "in a standard perturbative qcd approach to semi - inclusive processes and in particular to semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , factorization theorems  @xcite allow to extract soft hadronic wave functions from high energy reactions data .",
    "such non - perturbative process - independent distributions obey qcd renormalization group equations  @xcite . in presence of a hard scale , set by the virtuality of the exchanged boson in a deep inelastic event ,",
    "standard parton and fragmentation distributions predict , together with the corresponding process - dependent coefficient functions  @xcite , the semi - inclusive cross - sections .",
    "these distributions , basic ingredients in almost nowaday qcd - calculations , are well suited for studying full inclusive process , such as deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering or drell - yan process in hadronic collisions . in the recent past",
    "however it has became increasingly clear the less inclusive distributions , either space - like or time - like , are necessary to deal with a variety of semi - inclusive processes . in particular @xmath0-dependent distributions",
    "acquired particular relevance and a great activity has been registered recently in this research field @xcite . in the sidis case , for istance , final state hadrons are expected to have a sizeable transverse momentum due to both intrinsic motion of partons into hadrons  @xcite and to the radiative process off the struck parton line  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately transverse momentum is usually integrated over , loosing part of the information which is contained in the experimental cross - sections . for these reasons it would be highly desiderable to have the evolution equations for these extended @xmath0-dependent distributions .",
    "such evolution equations were first proposed in the time - like case in ref .",
    "@xcite and then recently extended in the space - like domain in ref .  @xcite . in order to have a complete description of the semi - inclusive cross - sections in terms of the transverse momentum , such a generalization was also performed in the target fragmentation region by introducing properly modified  @xcite fracture functions  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind the @xmath0-dependent evolution equations can be summarized as follows .",
    "let us consider parton emissions off a active , space - like , parton line . in the collinear limit , at each branching",
    ", the generated transverse momentum is negligible . in this limit",
    "however @xmath0-ordered diagrams can be shown to give leading logarithmic enhancements to the cross - sections .",
    "since such contributions can be resummed by dglap evolution equations  @xcite , at the end of the radiative process , the interacting parton could possibly have an appreciable transverse momentum . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0-dependent evolution equations therefore depend , in addition to standard longitudinal momentum fraction , also on transverse degree of freedom . when solutions to the evolution equations are used to reproduce the sidis transverse momentum spectrum , the predictions smooth interpolate from small to large transverse momenta , this being a signature of well known dis scaling violations in semi - inclusive process .",
    "the aim of this work is to offer a preliminar phenomenological study of @xmath0-dependent evolution equations and to compare it with available hadron production data in dis current fragmentation region .",
    "all the predictions are given by a handful of phenomenological assumptions .",
    "however such predictions are not the result of a fit to data , and thus strengthen our confidence in the general framework offered in ref .",
    "ordinary qcd evolution equations at leading logarithm accuracy ( lla ) resum terms of the type @xmath1 originating from quasi - collinear partons emission configurations , where @xmath2 represents the factorization scale .",
    "leading contributions are obtained when the virtualities of the partons in the ladder are strongly ordered . at each branching , the emitting parton thus acquires a transverse momentum relative to its initial direction .",
    "the radiative transverse momentum can be taken into account through transverse - momentum - dependent evolution equations , which in the time - like case read  @xcite : @xmath3 fragmentation functions @xmath4 of eq .",
    "( [ dglap_tmd_time ] ) give the probability to find , at a given scale @xmath5 , a hadron @xmath6 with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath7 and transverse momentum @xmath8 relative to the parent parton @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 are the time - like splitting functions which , at least at ll accuracy , can be interpreted as the probabilities to find a parton of type @xmath9 inside a parton of type @xmath11 and are expressed as a power series of the strong running coupling , @xmath12 .",
    "the order @xmath13 of the expansion of the splitting function matrix @xmath10 actually sets the accuracy of the evolution equations .",
    "the radiative transverse momentum square @xmath14 at each branching satisfies the invariant mass constraint @xmath15 .",
    "the transverse arguments of @xmath16 on r.h.s . of eq .",

    "the opposite statement however is not valid since eq .",

    "the corresponding evolution equations for @xmath25 can be obtained @xcite .",
