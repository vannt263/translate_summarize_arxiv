    "corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) are commonly found during solar minimum .",
    "they are formed when fast solar wind ( often from coronal holes ) overtakes slow solar wind ( often from near a streamer belt ) @xcite . because the slow and fast winds are two plasmas of different magnetic origin , there is a stream interface between them and two shock waves can form with a forward shock propagating into the slow wind and a reverse shock propagating into the fast wind ( but both carried outwards by the solar wind ) @xcite .",
    "the shock waves are often formed beyond 1 au @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies showed that cir shocks can form as close as @xmath2 au @xcite .",
    "cirs and the associated shocks are a major source of energetic particle acceleration in the interplanetary medium ; ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". indeed , during solar minimum when the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) rate is low , cirs are the dominant source of energetic particles in the interplanetary medium at 1 au ( for recent reviews ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these energetic particles have approximately a solar wind composition up to a few mev nucleon@xmath3 , and sometimes to @xmath4-@xmath5 mev nucleon@xmath3 , indicating that they are accelerated from the solar wind ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , examination of particles such as he@xmath6 and @xmath7he showed that they are more abundant in the cirs than in the uncompressed solar wind , suggesting that the interplanetary suprathermal ion pool also contributes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , recent observations by @xcite found that the heavy ion abundances show a clear correlation with sunspot number , where heavy ions are more enhanced during active periods .",
    "although the acceleration likely occurs at cir shocks , how the population of seed particles is injected into the shock remains not well understood .",
    "electrons are also accelerated to several hundred kev in cirs , particularly at distances beyond 1 au .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the peak fluxes in cirs often occur at the reverse and forward shocks , with fluxes at the reverse shock generally being larger @xcite .",
    "for example , in a recent survey of 50 cirs between 2007",
    "february and 2008 september , @xcite found that in 90% of the events the peak flux of energetic helium occurred within the compressed region or the trailing edge . in the remaining 10% of the events , the peak flux occurred within @xmath8 hours of the trailing edge .",
    "@xcite also confirmed this result .",
    "note that even if there are no shocks associated with the cirs , as long as there is significant local compression near the cirs , particles are subject to acceleration @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that , for cirs near 5 au , the local compression ratio was a key factor in determining the intensity of 1 mev protons , regardless of whether or not the cir was bounded by shocks .",
    "@xcite showed a similar result for @xmath9 mev / nucleon helium ions for cirs at 1 au .     the solar wind suprathermal electron population ( in the 70 to 2000 ev range ) is typically made of the `` halo '' population ( generally tenuous and isotropic ) and the `` strahl '' , an intense beam of suprathermal electrons aligned to the magnetic field and directed outward from the sun .",
    "owing to their large mean - free path , suprathermal electrons travel freely along magnetic field lines , and are therefore used as tracers of the large - scale heliospheric topology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although this population is usually dominated by the outward - flowing strahl , sunward - directed counter - streaming suprathermal electrons are also often recorded in the solar wind .",
    "these are observed on closed field lines with both ends attached to the sun , such as within interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) or newly closed field regions due to magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "counter - streaming suprathermal electrons may also occur due to the presence of magnetic field enhancements farther from the spacecraft along magnetic field lines , e.g. , within cirs , near their bounding shocks and to some distance downstream .",
    "the counterstreaming population in such cases is thought to result from wave - particle interactions and shock heating , combined with adiabatic mirroring and particle leakage into the upstream regions of the cir ( @xcite ) .",
    "because of the wavy nature of the interplanetary current sheet , multiple cirs can form in a single solar rotation .",
    "will the presence of multiple cirs affect the particle acceleration process ? in this paper , we report , to our knowledge , the first observation of an energetic particle event associated with a cir pair .",
    "in this work , we use the data from stereo s impact instrument suite @xcite . these include protons between @xmath10 kev nucleon@xmath3 to @xmath11 mev nucleon@xmath3 and electrons from @xmath12 kev to @xmath13 kev from the solar electron and proton telescope ( sept ) @xcite ; @xmath14-@xmath15 mev protons from 16 sectors of the low energy telescope ( let ) @xcite ; @xmath5 kev nucleon@xmath3 to @xmath16 mev nucleon@xmath3 proton , helium , oxygen , and fe ions from the suprathermal ion telescope ( sit ) @xcite ; and @xmath17 ev electrons from the solar wind electron analyszer ( swea ) @xcite .",

    "the spread of the magnetic field direction is narrower than in panel a and the center of the distribution is slightly inclined towards the r direction .",
    "the flux is more than @xmath4 times higher than those in panel a and there is a clear anisotropy in that more protons are propagating towards the sun than away .",
    "the anisotropy suggests that the source of the @xmath14-@xmath15 mev protons was located outside 1 au .",
    "these protons were presumably accelerated at the reverse shock of cir1 ( now beyond 1 au ) and propagated back to @xmath51 au . note that the fluxes detected by the @xmath53 detectors facing against the sun ( the upper left @xmath53 sectors ) do not differ much between themselves , @xmath57/(@xmath58 s sr mev / n ) . similarly the fluxes detected by the @xmath53 detectors facing the sun ( the lower right @xmath53 sectors ) did not differ much , @xmath59/(@xmath58 s sr mev / n ) . so the fluxes are isotropic in each hemispheres .",
    "note that particles propagating towards the sun can be reflected , and then as they move back away from the sun , their pitch angles will approach zero due to the `` magnetic focusing '' effect .",

    "what caused all these unusual observations in this event ?",
    "the presence of the second cir likely plays an important role . however these observations are also rare for cir pairs .",
    "indeed as we will discuss in the following , for the carrington rotation immediately before and after cr2060 , where cir pairs also appeared , energetic ion intensity observations showed the normal temporal behavior of single cir cases .",
    "this is somewhat expected because unless the two cirs are magnetically connected , the presence of a second cir will have no effects on the energetic particles associated with the first cir , and vice versa .",
    "the above argument suggests that magnetic connection is important in the case of cr2060 .",
    "we argue in the following that these observations ( as shown in figures  [ fig : sep - observation ] to  [ fig : sep - anisotropy ] ) resulted from particle acceleration and trapping between the reverse shock of the first cir and the forward shock of the second cir through a large scale `` u - shape '' magnetic field that connects these two shocks .",

    "three u - shaped magnetic field lines are shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",

    ", we now describe a scenario to explain the stereo - b observations .",
    "consider first period a , at this time stb had just passed the newly developed reverse shock from left ( downstream ) to right ( upstream ) .",
    "it was close to the shock , so the distribution of the energetic particles did not show a strong anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , since the shock was newly formed at this distance , the acceleration was less efficient and the intensity of the energetic particles was low . as stb moved clockwise to period b , it connected to the part of the shock that was further away , where the shock was stronger . since the shock was the source of the energetic particles ,",
    "we expect to see most energetic particles propagating sunward during this period , as observed in figure  [ fig : sep - anisotropy ] .",
    "although most particles were flowing toward the sun , @xmath64 were moving away from the sun .",
    "this is not unusual in cir events where the pitch angle anisotropies are usually modest .",
    "a small anisotropy is likely due to a strong pitch angle scattering .",
    "furthermore magnetic reflection of sunward flowing particles , as they move closer to the sun , can reverse their propagation directions .",
    "so even if pitch angle scattering is not strong , these reflected particles will be observed as moving away from the sun .    moving from period a to b , the particle intensity increases , and the anisotropy also increases . in the u - shaped magnetic field scenario , this is due to the spacecraft being connected to stronger sources ( further away ) . as the spacecraft further moved to period c , we find that the direction of the magnetic field went through a phase during which it was mostly perpendicular to the nominal parker field direction and eventually the @xmath1 flipped sign .",
    "this can be explained naturally with the u - shaped magnetic field , since in this case , the b field direction had to undergo a change from a parker - spiral - like with @xmath65 to an intermediate state where @xmath66 and finally to a direction with @xmath63 . during period c , the intensity of energetic ions also increases . this is not surprising since now the u - shaped field lines connected to both the reverse shock of cir1 and the forward shock of cir2 , so that accelerated particles are effectively trapped between the two shocks .",
    "furthermore , since it was in the middle of cir1 and cir2 , it connected to the furthest and strongest parts of both shocks , consequently the acceleration was the most efficient . also note that further away the shock compression ratio could be larger and",
    "the particle spectrum can be therefore harder . that particles are now trapped between two shocks",
    "also implies that the anisotropy in period c will be smaller than that in period b. this is what the observations show in figure  [ fig : sep - anisotropy ] .",
    "we note that for energetic electrons , because they move fast , they may undergo multiple reflections between the reverse shock of cir1 and the forward shock of cir2 .",
    "this may lead to a more efficient acceleration than that at a single shock .    in period d",
    ", the u - shaped field lines were still connected to the reverse shock of cir1 , but not connected to the forward shock of cir2 because it was not yet formed at 1 au ( during period d the field lines are the same as those in period a and b ) .",
    "the u - shaped magnetic field is not connected to the forward shock of the cir2 , so only limited reflection can occur locally in cir2 , and therefore the energetic particles in period d were mostly streaming away from the sun .",
    "this agrees with the anisotropy observations in figure  [ fig : sep - anisotropy ] .",
    "furthermore , the absence of the reflection also implies that the intensity of energetic ions in period d will drop comparing to period c. this agrees with the time - intensity profile observations shown in figure  [ fig : sep - observation ] and figure  [ fig : sep - anisotropy ] .",
    "note that the intensity in period d is comparable to those in period a and b. also we remark that magnetic field enhancement in a cir without shock can also reflect particles , but presumably of less efficiency than if there is a shock .     in our proposed scenario ,",
    "the large scale u - shaped magnetic field topology is the key .",
    "so it is important to see if there is corroborating observational evidence for this .",
    "as explained in the introduction , solar wind suprathermal electrons can be used to infer the large - scale topology of the interplanetary magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies @xcite showed that counter - streaming suprathermal electrons are frequently observed in the vicinity of cirs , owing to wave - particle interactions and shock heating , combined with adiabatic mirroring and particle leakage into the upstream regions ( both into the adjacent slow and fast winds ) .",
    "however , statistical analyses @xcite showed that such counter - streaming features are only observed to some limited distance downstream of the cir bounding shocks / compressions .",
    "in other words , they are not expected to extend all the way from one cir to the next .",
    "we thus now examine the pitch angle distributions ( pad ) of @xmath17 ev electrons in the context of the proposed u - shaped topology .",
    "we first consider stereo - b observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : stb_b_strahl ] , the top panel displays the normalized ( for each sample ) electron pad , the second panel shows the solar wind speed , and the next four panels show the magnetic field components and its magnitude .",
    "this figure shows a dominant anti - field - aligned strahl until doy @xmath67239 .    on day 236 , we note a short duration reversal of the dominant pad polarity .",
    "however , this is commonly observed when strong acceleration and reflection of suprathermal electrons occurs at cir shocks ( cf .",
    "although not shown , the fluxes of the @xmath68 population actually remained the same as adjacent regions during this short interval , but the overwhelming fluxes of the reflected population make the normalized pads appear dominated by this reflected population .",
    "the most important pad feature is seen between the two cirs .",
    "starting slightly before doy 379 at the time of the reverse shock of cir1 , and lasting until the beginning of cir2 ( doy 243 ) , stereo - b recorded unusual and essentially continuous counter - streaming pads . as shown in previous studies ,",
    "this feature is not necessarily related to a closed field topology .",
    "it is often seen upstream of cir shocks , but again what makes it unusual here is that it is observed continuously between the two cirs . in the proposed scenario of",
    "a u - shaped magnetic topology connecting the reverse shock of cir1 and the forward shock of cir2 , counter - streaming suprathermal electrons is a natural consequence ; for the same reasons as explained previously for more energetic ions and electrons .",
    "a u - shaped magnetic topology also implies that @xmath1 will reverse sign , as indicated by the red vertical line in figure 9 .",
    "note that the @xmath1 reversal is in any case expected between two consecutive cirs , if these do not come from pseudo streamers , as is the case here .",
    "figure  [ fig : ace_b_strahl ] and figure  [ fig : sta_b_strahl ] are similar to figure  [ fig : stb_b_strahl ] , but for ace and stereo - a , respectively . compared to stereo - b , the counter - streaming features at ace and stereo - a are much less prominent , and of shorter durations .",
    "the vertical red lines mark the times when @xmath1 changes sign at ace and stereo - a . in both cases",
    ", @xmath1 reversed sign in the slow solar wind and close to cir2 , as is usually the case .",
    "this is unlike the @xmath1 sign change at stereo - b which is very significantly farther from cir2 .",
    "we take these observations as additional arguments in favor of a large - scale u - shaped topology , as depicted in figure 8 , which is caused by magnetic reconnection in the high corona .",
    "this phenomenon is transient in nature since ace and stereo - a measurements do not show the same continuous pad properties as stereo - b .",
    "as discussed next , these properties are also not found for the previous and next carrington rotations .",
    "ev strahl electrons ; solar wind proton speed ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath50 components of the vector magnetic field ; and total magnetic field magnitude",
    ". the reversal of @xmath1 is indicated by the vertical red line . ,",

    "note that the ace observation uses the gse coordinate system , while stereo - a and b use the rtn system .",

    "scaledwidth=100.0% ]    , but for stereo - a .",
    "note that the ace observation uses the gse coordinate system , while stereo - a and b use the rtn system .",
    "the reversal of @xmath1 is indicated by the vertical red line .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the observations discussed so far have motivated us to conjecture the existence of a large scale u - shaped magnetic field topology between the reverse shock of cir1 and the forward shock of cir2 .",
    "the u - shaped magnetic field was possibly caused by reconnection that occurred high in the corona .",
    "as such , it is expected to be transient in nature , which explains why these unusual energetic particle observations were most prominent at one spacecraft , in this case stereo - b .",
    "such a transient nature of the u - shaped magnetic field also implies that similar observations are not expected to emerge for the cir pairs before and after cr2060 .",
    "we now examine the energetic particle observations from the cirs in the preceding and following carrington rotations by stereo - b . these are shown in figure  [ fig : precir ] and figure  [ fig : aftcir ] .    for cr2059 , while the two high speed solar wind streams are evident , the shock pair that bounded the first cir could not be identified . in comparison , the forward shock , but not the reverse shock , of the second cir",
    "has developed at 1 au .",
    "there was clear signatures of particle acceleration at the second cir as shown by the enhancement of electrons and ions in most of the energy channels .",
    "the intensities of the @xmath12 to @xmath69 kev electron and @xmath10 to @xmath27 kev / nucleon ion showed noticeable enhancement at the first cir .",
    "the time intensity profiles between the two cirs showed a very regular behavior as expected since there was no reverse shock associated with the first cir .",
    "for the cr2061 , the shock pairs that bounded both cirs can be clearly seen , making it a good comparison to cr2060 .",
    "compared to figure  [ fig : sep - observation ] , we see stark differences in the time intensity profiles between the cir pairs . in cr2061 , there were the normal drop - outs followed by gradual enhancements of energetic electrons and ions between the two cirs .",
    "this is best illustrated by the @xmath32-@xmath16 mev ion channel . without the u - shaped magnetic field topology",
    ", this drop - out is a normal behavior since the spacecraft moved further away from the reverse shock of the first cir .",
    "similarly the subsequent gradual increase is due to the spacecraft becoming closer to the forward shock of the second cir .",
    "so the presence of a cir pair is only a necessary condition for the observations shown in figure  [ fig : sep - observation ] . in our proposed scenario ,",
    "the essential requirement for the unusual intensity enhancements between the two cirs is a field that connects the two cirs ( to be more specific , the reverse shock of the first cir and the forward shock of the second cir ) .",
    "this is achieved through magnetic reconnection in the high corona .        , but for cr2061.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "we report the observation of the acceleration and trapping of energetic ions and electrons at a cir pair .",
    "the event occurred in carrington rotation ( cr ) 2060 and the two cirs , with a separation less than @xmath0 days , were observed by three spacecraft : stereo - b , ace and stereo - a .",
    "\\3 ) the pad of high energy protons between the two cirs showed an unusual sequence of first being nearly isotropic , followed by mostly sunward propagating , then isotropic , and finally mostly anti - sunward propagating .",
    "these features have motivated us to propose a u - shaped large - scale magnetic field topology connecting the reverse shock of the first cir and the forward shock of the second cir .",
    "a u - shaped magnetic field can simultaneously explain all the above observations .",
    "the key point is that a magnetic field connecting the two shocks ( the reverse shock of cir1 and the forward shock of cir2 ) will allow particles to be trapped and accelerated between the two shocks .",
    "we conjecture that magnetic reconnection occurring in the high corona is the cause of such a u - shaped magnetic field .",
    "after reconnection , the u - shaped magnetic field propagates out to the heliosphere .",
    "we infer that the magnetic reconnection process is transient in structure because observations from ace and stereo - a for the same event were less prominent and because there were no similar observations during the preceding and following carrington rotations . in a future paper",
    ", we plan to examine particle acceleration at a cir - pair with a u - shaped magnetic field configuration using a test particle simulation .",
