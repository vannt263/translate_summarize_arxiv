    "gravitational microlensing can be used to detect extra - solar planets orbiting distant stars @xcite with relatively large photometric signals as long as the angular planetary einstein ring radius is not much smaller than the angular size of the source star @xcite . for giant source stars in the galactic bulge , however , the signals of earth - mass planets are largely washed out by their large angular size , but galactic bulge main sequence stars are small enough to allow the detection of planets with masses as low as @xmath2 .    this fact has led to suggestions that ground - based microlensing surveys might be able to measure the abundance of earth - like planets @xcite . however , the initial estimates of the sensitivity of such a survey neglected the blending of main sequence source stars in the bulge that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - image ] .",
    "the brightness of the source stars was over - estimated , and it was not realized that the actual source stars were blended with several other stars of similar brightness in ground - based images .",
    "more realistic estimates of the sensitivity of the proposed ground - based extra - solar planet searches indicated very poor sensitivity to terrestrial planets @xcite , and suggested that only a space - based survey @xcite could discover a significant number of earth - like planets .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the most capable ground - based microlensing survey that could reasonably be attempted : a network of three 2-m class wide field - of - view telescopes spanning the globe in the southern hemisphere that are dedicated to the microlensing planet search survey for four years .",
    "many of the details of our simulations have been described in @xcite , but there are additional details that must be added to describe the observing conditions at ground - based observatories .",
    "i assume that the microlensing survey telescopes are located at the best existing observatory sites in chile ( paranal ) , south africa ( sutherland ) , and australia ( siding springs ) . for paranal , actual seeing and cloud cover records are available from the eso web site .",
    "the sutherland site in south africa has conditions similar to la silla in chile ( peter martinez , private communication ) , so the eso records for la silla ( offset by 1 year ) were used as a proxy for sutherland .",
    "standard airmass and wavelength correction formulae @xcite were used to convert the eso seeing data to seeing estimates for bulge observations in the i - band , and the sky brightness was calculated following @xcite .    for the observations from australia ,",
    "the 1997 - 1999 seeing records from the macho project have been used since the mt .",
    "stromlo observatory and siding springs have very similar seeing . to compensate for the optical effects of the macho telescope , 0.8 ",
    "was subtracted in quadrature from all the macho telescope seeing values .",
    "the number of clear nights was adjusted slightly to meet the long term averages for each site as listed in @xcite .",
    "an important input to this simulation is the systematic crowded field photometry errors that are assigned .",
    "the ogle - iii ews data @xcite provides a set of photometry for stars with brightness varying in a predictable way ( due to microlensing ) using the most accurate crowded field photometry method devised to date @xcite . by fitting to point - source ,",
    "single - lens light curves to the 2002 ogle - iii ews data for stars brighter than @xmath3 , we find an assumed systematic error of 0.7% of the total flux at the psf peak of each star seems to give fit @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic errors appear to be larger for fainter stars or for other data sets , but i adopt this as a systematic error estimation formula .",
    "this systematic error implies a limit to the useful size of a microlensing planet search survey telescope .",
    "once the systematic error dominates , it is no longer useful to go to a larger telescope .",
    "our simulation results yield an optimal telescope aperture of about 2-m with a 6 sq .",
    "deg .  field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "larger telescopes could detect some more planets by cycling between two or more fields , but the gain is not large because of the rapid decrease in the microlensing rate away from the central galactic bulge .",
    "[ fig - bad - lc1 ] shows an example of two light curves that would be considered planet detections by the criteria of @xcite for a space - based survey ( a @xmath5 improvement for the planetary lensing model over the best single lens model ) .",
    "but the uneven data quality due to seeing variations and cloud cover imply that the planetary parameters can not be constrained .",
    "thus , while the planetary signal is detectable for these events , terrestrial planets can not be discovered with data like this .",
    "the situation is only slightly better for the events shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - bad - lc2 ] , where the poor seeing in australia , and low s / n of the planetary deviation conspire to prevent determinations of the planetary masses .",
    "of course , sometimes a planetary signal will be seen during good observing conditions , yielding light curves that can accurately determine the planetary parameters .",
    "this is the case for the two events shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - good - lc ] .",
    "generally , such events have planetary deviations that occur at high magnification , such as the event on the left or have large amplitude deviations like the event on the right .",
    "intermediate between the poorly covered planetary detections shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - bad - lc1][fig - bad - lc2 ] and the well covered planetary discoveries shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - good - lc ] are the light curves shown in fig .  [ fig - fair - lc ] . in both cases ,",
    "the planetary parameters can be formally determined .",
    "however for the event on the left , the source star brightness is only @xmath6 .",
    "if the photometry errors are not random , as is likely for systematic errors , then the brightness of the source star can not be determined from the light curve fit .",
    "hence , the planetary parameters will be poorly constrained . for the light curve on the right",
    ", the parameters can be determined despite the relatively poor coverage of the deviation because the deviation shape contains redundant information .",
    "however , the poor light curve coverage means that the redundancy can not be used to confirm the interpretation of the event .",
    "this is a serious drawback because the planet discovery can not be confirmed in any other way .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig - bad - lc1]-[fig - good - lc ] it is sensible to consider two different categories of detected planetary events : `` detected '' planets and `` discovered '' planets .",
    "the `` detected '' category includes all planets with planetary signals that provide at least a @xmath7 improvement over the best single lens fit .",
    "clearly , the events shown in fig .  [ fig - good - lc ] should be in the `` discovered '' while those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - bad - lc1 ] and [ fig - bad - lc2 ] should not be in this category .",
    "we define the planet `` discovered '' category with the following criteria .",
    "each planetary light curve deviation is split up into 1 - 3 separate deviation regions of positive or negative magnification with respect to the single lens curve with the same parameters .",
    "the first and last regions are considered be begin and end when the deviation reaches the with 10% of the maximum planetary deviation or 0.3% of single lens magnification . for a planet `` discovery '' , each the observations must cover at least 40% of each planetary deviation region , and at least 60% of each total deviation .",
    "all measurements are considered to contribute the light curve coverage unless their error estimates are larger than one third of the maximum planetary deviation .",
    "also , because a significant component of the error estimates is a systematic error , we also require that each  discovery \" light curve have at least one measurement that detected the stellar microlensing event by @xmath8 and one measurement that detects the planetary deviation by @xmath9 . with these definitions , about one third of the detected planets",
    "pass the planet discovery threshold including both the events in fig .",
    "[ fig - good - lc ] and the light curve on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig - fair - lc ] .",
    "[ fig - det_sep ] compares the sensitivity of a 3-site network of 2m - class ground - based microlensing planet search telescopes vs.  a space - based microlensing planet search telescope that would be appropriate for nasa s discovery program @xcite . at present",
    ", the cost cap for a discovery mission is $ 360 m , and the ground - based network that i have simulated would be roughly one fifth that cost , including all software development and operational expenses .",
    "the ground - based survey does the best at separations of 23 au where the planet is near the einstein ring and is detectable in high magnification events .",
    "the ground - based survey would have about 30 times fewer planet discoveries and 10 times fewer raw detections of terrestrial planets at these separations . at 1 au",
    ", the advantage of space for planet discoveries is a factor of 100 .",
    "the number of planet detections as a function of planetary mass fraction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - det_eps ] for planets in earth - like orbits and planets in all orbits .",
    "the left hand panel indicates that even if earth - like planets in earth - like orbits are quite abundant , the 3-site ground - based survey would only expect to find one with good light curve coverage .",
    "the ground - based results in fig .  [ fig - det_eps ] are somewhat misleading for @xmath10 because these events can generally be detected with giant source stars , which have not been included in this simulation .",
    "these would add significantly to the ground - based detections , but would add little to the space - based detections .",
    "so , for planets with mass fractions about ten times that of the earth , the ground - based survey may have an advantage .",
    "i have carried out detailed simulations of the most capable ground - based microlensing terrestrial planet search program that could plausibly be attempted .",
    "the simulated survey employs three 2 m class telescopes spanning the globe in the southern hemisphere which observe the galactic bulge whenever possible for a period of 4 years .",
    "such a network is about 100 times less sensitive than a space - based survey which might only cost 5 times as much .",
    "so , without some dramatic improvement in ground - based crowded field photometry , it will not be possible to conduct a microlensing survey to determine the abundance of terrestrial planets in the inner galaxy .    for a gravitational census of terrestrial planets",
    ", a space - based survey will be required @xcite . as fig .",
    "[ fig - n_vs_sep ] indicates , such a mission would complete the survey for terrestrial planets that will be started by the kepler mission @xcite which is sensitive to earth - like planets at separations @xmath11au using the transit method .",
    "a space - based microlensing survey would overlap kepler with sensitivity at @xmath12au , and extend sensitivity to terrestrial planets to all separations including free - floating planets , which may have been ejected from their parent stars during the planetary formation process .",
