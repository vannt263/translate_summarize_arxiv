    "for example , if the cooling timescale @xcite or acceleration timescale @xcite of a pion or a muon is shorter than the decay timescale , the spectral shape of neutrinos produced from the decay of those particles would be significantly modified .",
    "especially , because the decay times are different between pions and muons , the energy dependence of neutrino fluxes would be different from flavor to flavor .",

    "we formulate a general model for the shock acceleration of pions and muons , which are produced from shock - accelerated protons via photomeson interactions , and give versatile expressions of the neutrino spectra for later application . in section 3 , we show that the acceleration of pions / muons would be possible in low - power grbs occurring inside their progenitors , and apply our model to that case to compute the neutrino spectra and flavor ratios .",

    "the neutrino spectra are flat in the high energy range when pions and muons are reaccelerated .",

    "the neutrino spectrum of the former component is flat in the high energy range where the acceleration timescale becomes comparable to the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "the flavor ratio of neutrinos at the source , @xmath247 , would deviate from @xmath4 , which is expected from photomeson interactions , and approaches to @xmath6 above the energy at which the decay timescale of a muon becomes longer than the dynamical timescale of the shock because only the @xmath132 flux is reduced .",
    "the transition width of the observed flavor ratio is @xmath248 decades in energy ( fig .",
