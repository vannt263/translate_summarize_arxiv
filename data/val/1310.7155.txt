    "with the recent advent of large - scale comprehensive void catalogs  @xcite , cosmological analysis is beginning to fan out from probes solely focused on overdensities such as galaxy correlations  @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations  @xcite to more general studies based on alternative information sources available in the cosmic web .",
    "since the primary target of cosmological analysis is often quantifying and understanding dark energy  @xcite , exploiting the underdense voids in the matter distribution of the universe is a natural choice : the interiors of voids are dominated by dark energy  @xcite , so their shapes , sizes , and growth histories are intimately tied to the global properties of the large - scale universe  @xcite .",
    "already researchers have begun to exploit the public void catalogs .",
    "@xcite correlated void positions with wmap measurements of cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies  @xcite to obtain a weak measurement of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite .",
    "the planck collaboration followed up on this study to confirm a detection  @xcite . @xcite",
    "have performed a measurement of gravitational weak lensing around voids in data ( theoretically predicted by  @xcite and  @xcite ) to directly measure the underdensities in the dark matter .",
    "@xcite used a novel method to measure the real - space radial density profiles within voids without assumptions about cosmological or redshift - space distortion models .",
    "finally ,  @xcite began to measure cosmological parameters by leveraging the statistical isotropy of stacked voids  @xcite to perform an alcock - paczynski test  @xcite .",
    "looking ahead , there are many more promising applications of voids to cosmology and astrophysics . at the most simple level",
    ", the size distribution of voids is sensitive to cosmological parameters  @xcite and modified gravity  @xcite , though these effects can be confused by uncertainties in galaxy formation physics  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the shapes of voids as encoded by the mean ellipticity would shed light on dark energy  @xcite as well as the two - point correlation of the void positions  @xcite .",
    "the radial density profile , reconstructed in real space using techniques such as those described in  @xcite , can also be used to constrain exotic dark energy models  @xcite .",
    "astrophysically , voids can also be used to measure primordial magnetic fields  @xcite and the effects of environment on galaxy formation  @xcite    to support current and future void - based science efforts we must continue to identify voids in the latest galaxy surveys . this way we can take advantage of deeper and wider surveys for a greater redshift lever arm for cosmological parameter estimation and for more volume for increasing the signal - to - noise of statistical void properties .",
    "also , even though current surveys such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ;  @xcite ) may not be optimal for void analysis due to their relatively low sampling density , we can use void catalogs from data to test and calibrate results against theoretical expectations in preparation for larger - volume surveys in the future such as euclid  @xcite , bigboss  @xcite , and wfirst  @xcite .",
    "ever since  @xcite pointed out a potential discrepancy between the interior contents of voids in @xmath5cdm  predictions and observations , there has been intense interest in comparing voids between simulations and observations .",
    "this has been done for earlier void catalogs in the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ;  @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ;  @xcite ) data release 7  @xcite , and in earlier surveys  @xcite but in a very restricted context : it is difficult to build simulations with high enough resolution to capture all the survey galaxies and sufficient size to enclose the entire survey volume . rather than attempt to reproduce complex observational details such as survey geometry , typically authors take a limited volume within the survey and compare the statistical properties of the remaining voids to voids identified in a galaxy population generated with semi - analytic modeling  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this common approach has several shortcomings : it is difficult to precisely tune semi - analytic models to a given survey  @xcite and it does not take advantage of the full survey volume .",
    "we can address any potential discrepancies in a more robust way by building nearly identical survey - like populations in our simulations .",
    "an examination of the impacts of the survey mask is especially important , since only selecting voids far away from the survey area discards much useful information , and without rigorous void selection there may still be residual systematics . also , since theoretical work with voids is done in simulations with cubic volumes , understanding the role of the mask is essential for building the links between theory and data .",
    "since survey masks usually have complicated shapes , their impact is highly non - trivial , non - obvious , and different for each survey .",
    "@xcite noted differences between masked and unmasked void populations in the 2dfgrs , although  @xcite did not find significant differences when examining the properties of voids with their void finding algorithm in a low - redshift volume - limited sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "however , there has been no such examination in higher redshifts of the sdss with the vide algorithm  @xcite , which is the source of the current large void catalogs .",
    "we explore another important link , the impacts of sparsity and galaxy bias , in another work  @xcite , while earlier works such as  @xcite have connected redshift - space voids to those in real space .    in this work , we present voids in the sdss data release 9 cmass sample  @xcite , a survey covering 3,000 square degrees from redshift 0.43 to 0.7 , for a total volume of nearly @xmath6 cubic @xmath7gpc .",
    "we compare these voids to voids found in two sets of mock catalogs : the published mocks of  @xcite and our own derived from a large - volume high - resolution @xmath3-body simulation . in the simulation",
    "we are able to capture the entire survey without overlapping or stitching simulation volumes , allowing us to examine the systematic impacts of the survey mask on void statistical properties such as number functions , radial profiles , and ellipticities .",
    "while the low galaxy density of this survey is not ideal for void identification , the analysis of  @xcite indicates that voids found in surveys of this type still correspond to physical underdensities in the dark matter , and thus are still useful probes of cosmology and astrophysics . in addition ,  @xcite shows that the universal density profile of  @xcite fits voids identified in all densities of samples , and that there exist simple scaling relations between voids in different samples , which means that the objects identified even in low - density surveys correspond to voids .    in the next section",
    "we establish our coordinate system and briefly discuss our void - finding method and strategies for handling masks in the survey data .",
    "section  [ sec : voiddata ] introduces our galaxy survey samples and the properties of the voids identified in them . in section  [ sec : voidmocks ] we present our mock galaxy populations and compare voids in these masked and unmasked populations to the voids in the data .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] offers concluding remarks regarding implications for future surveys and void - based science .",
    "for each galaxy in the survey , we transform its sky latitude @xmath8 , sky longitude @xmath9 , and redshift @xmath10 , to a comoving coordinate system : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the comoving distance to the galaxy at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "we assume a @xmath5cdm  cosmology consistent with wmap 7-year results  @xcite : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we identify voids with a modified and extended version of zobov  @xcite .",
    "called vide  @xcite .",
    "vide creates a voronoi tessellation of the tracer particle population and uses the watershed transform to group voronoi cells into zones and voids  @xcite .",
    "the watershed transform identifies catchment basins as the cores of voids and ridgelines , which separate the flow of water , as the boundaries of voids .",
    "the watershed transform builds a nested hierarchy of voids  @xcite , and for the purposes of this work we only examine _ root _ voids , which are voids at the base of the tree hierarchy and hence have no parents .",
    "we also impose two density - based criteria on our void catalog .",
    "the first is a threshold cut within vide itself where voids only include as additional members voronoi zones with density less than @xmath16 the mean particle density .",
    "if a void consists of only a single zone ( as they often do in sparse populations ) then this restriction does not apply .",
    "we apply the second density criterion as a post - processing step : we only include voids with mean central densities below @xmath16 the mean particle density .",
    "we measure this central density within a sphere with radius @xmath17 , where @xmath18 in the expression above , @xmath19 is the sum of the voronoi volumes of the particles which comprise the void .",
    "we also ignore voids with @xmath20 below the mean particle spacing of the tracer population .",
    "additionally , for the analysis below we need to define a center for the void . for our work ,",
    "we take the macrocenter , or volume - weighted center of all the voronoi cells in the void : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the positions and voronoi volumes of each tracer @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "as presented in  @xcite and  @xcite , vide includes modifications to zobov to account for survey boundaries , internal masks , and redshift limits . to handle line - of - sight boundaries and internal masks ,",
    "we pixelize the survey region using healpix  @xcite and identify boundary pixels ( i.e. , pixels with at least one non - survey region neighbor ) .",
    "we inject particles along the line of sight within each boundary pixel with a spatial density of @xmath25 . by giving these boundary particles essentially infinite density and breaking their degeneracies in the voronoi graph ,",
    "we prevent the watershed algorithm from growing voids outside the survey region .",
    "also , these boundary particles serve as a marker for identifying voids near the edge . figure  [ fig : mask ] shows our identification of the sdss dr9",
    "@xcite survey boundary pixels . to accurately capture the shape of the mask we required a resolution of @xmath26 ( @xmath27  @xmath7mpc  at @xmath28 in a @xmath5cdm  universe ) .    following the procedure of  @xcite ,",
    "we generate two void catalogs for each sample , which we call _ all _ and  _ central _ catalogs .",
    "naturally , the _ all _ sample contains every identified void which satisfied the density cutoff criteria , even voids near the survey edge .",
    "on the other hand , _ central _ voids do not touch any boundary particle ( i.e. , the most distant void member particle is closer than any boundary particle ) , and thus are not near any survey boundary or internal mask .",
    "the _ central _ sample is designed to ensure that we have a fair distribution of void shapes and alignments within the survey volume . to handle survey high - redshift caps , we simply exclude from all catalogs any void which extends beyond the redshift limits of a given sample .",
    "this is a more restrictive approach than the procedure discussed in  @xcite , since it is difficult to construct stable tessellations on co - spherical points . to evaluate this ,",
    "if the distance from the void macrocenter to the redshift edge is closer than the distance to _ any _ void member particle , we reject the void .",
    "we take our galaxy sample from the cmass selection of sdss dr9 ( boss ) spectroscopic targets  @xcite .",
    "this is the same sample of galaxies used in the analysis of  @xcite .",
    "the 455,281 galaxies in this selection of the survey extend from @xmath0 to @xmath28 .",
    "as before in our catalog of voids in sdss dr7",
    "@xcite , we take volume - limited samples to ensure statistical uniformity and constant shot noise and galaxy bias around our identified voids . also , we require volume - limited samples in order to compare to our mocks based on halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models , which are constructed around volume - limited surveys  @xcite .",
    "we apply simple evolution and @xmath29-corrections of the form @xmath30 and compute absolute magnitudes @xmath31 assuming the cosmological parameters noted above .",
    "we choose three redshift bins .",
    "each redshift range is characterized by a typical galaxy luminosity , which we differentiate by the labels  _ dim _ , _ mid _ , and  _ bright_. our redshift bins are : @xmath32 , which we label _ cmass dim _ , @xmath33 , labeled as _",
    "cmass mid _ , and @xmath34 , called _ cmass bright_. table  [ tab : samples ] lists the sample name , limiting absolute magnitude , redshift bound , comoving volume , number of galaxies , and the mean galaxy separation in that sample .",
    "the mean galaxy spacing is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of galaxies within each sample and @xmath19 is the sample volume .",
    "= 0.11 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : voidsamples_mock ]      our first point of comparison is the cumulative number function . in figure",
    "[ fig : numberfunc_mockvsdata ] we compare the number function of voids in the _ cmass mid _ data sample to all our mocks .",
    "first , the unmasked _",
    "n - body mock _",
    "simulation hosts roughly three times as many voids per unit volume than the data , even though they have similar galaxy populations .",
    "this occurs at all scales , though there are @xmath37 times as many small voids in the unmasked mock as in the data .",
    "we can understand this disruption by considering the effects of the mask on a particular void : it will slice the void , making it appear as a smaller voids .",
    "so after the mask is applied large voids become medium voids , medium voids become small voids , and so on . since the number function falls steeply with void size , if we consider a given void size range , then there are far fewer voids being added to that range ( by being sliced and becoming smaller ) than voids that are lost to smaller ranges .",
    "this leads to a systematic reduction in the number density of voids . for larger survey areas and more complete coverage",
    ", we expect less drastic impacts .    in the same figure we plot the theoretical number function of  @xcite , which was derived from an excursion set formalism .",
    "as found in  @xcite , the best match to voids in low - density galaxy surveys comes from adjusting the `` void parameter '' @xmath38 to @xmath39 . while the number function roughly agrees with the order of magnitude of the full _ n - body mock _",
    "void population , it does not fall off as steeply as in the mocks , though this might be influenced by finite - volume effects . still , the correspondence of these curves shows that theoretical modeling can qualitatively match unmasked void populations , but further adjustments must be made to match void statistics from masked volumes .",
    "when we apply the dr9 survey geometry to our mock catalogs , we see excellent agreement in the number functions for both _ all _ and _ central _ catalogs .",
    "2lpt _ mocks show much less variance at small void sizes and reach larger void sizes than the _ n - body _ mocks , since there are many more _",
    "2lpt _ simulations and they are each drawn from independent realizations .",
    "the different orientations of the _ n - body _ mocks are limited by the cosmic variance of a single simulation , so it is not surprising that we are not able to match the void number function at the largest void sizes .",
    "however , with the _",
    "2lpt _ mocks , we are able to capture the very largest voids .",
    "@xcite first pointed out a potential tension between @xmath5cdm  model and data , but we see no indication of this tension in our results .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellip_comparemid ] shows the ellipticity distributions and mean ellipticities , identically to figure  [ fig : ellip_data ] . in this plot",
    ", we compare _ cmass mid _ ellipticities to those found in mock samples .",
    "voids in all mock and data samples tend to be more elliptical than voids drawn from poissonian distributions ( which give @xmath40 ) , confirming the analysis of  @xcite , which showed that ellipticity is a robust measurement even in low - density samples such as sdss dr9 .    as we saw earlier for the cumulative number functions , we find agreement between data and theoretical expectations in the form of mock catalogs _ only _ when we apply the mask : then the distributions are nearly identical .",
    "the _ all _ void samples agree among all the masked mocks and data .",
    "the mean ellipticities of the _ central _ _ masked n - body mock _ are slightly more than 2@xmath41 discrepant than the data , while the _ masked 2lpt mocks _ have much better agreement with the data .",
    "the differences between the _ n - body _ and _ 2lpt _ mock populations are not surprising since they have slightly different cosmologies , and the ellipticity is a very sensitive probe of cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "also , the _ 2lpt _ mocks cover multiple realizations , whereas the _",
    "n - body _ mocks are restricted to a single simulation . with the exception of the _ masked n - body mock _ , we see the same relationship between _ all _ and _ central _ ellipticities as in the data : voids in _ central",
    "_ samples less spherical .",
    "indeed , the @xmath42 voids in all the _",
    "2lpt _ mocks reduce the uncertainties to such a degree that this difference is easily distinguishable .",
    "voids in the data and masked mocks are more elliptical than in the full - volume simulation .",
    "we can understand the impact of the mask by examining the relationship between ellipticity and void size , as we show for the masked and unmasked _",
    "n - body _ mocks in figure  [ fig : ellipradius ] .",
    "the cause of the shift in ellipticities when masking data is readily apparent : larger voids tend to be more spherical , and their exclusion from the masked catalogs increases the overall mean ellipticity .",
    "the uncertainties in the _ n - body _ mocks are too large to distinguish any differences .",
    "we derive the theoretical ellipticity distribution from diva  @xcite with the rescaling parameter @xmath43 , as discussed in the analysis of  @xcite .",
    "diva requires a void size distribution as input , and we take the actual distribution from the _ cmass mid _ _ central _ sample ( i.e. , figure  [ fig : numberfunc_data ] ) .",
    "this choice of rescaling parameter @xmath44 provided good agreements with mock void populations , and again here we see agreement with data , indicating a relationship between the sizes of voids identified with the watershed transform and their dynamical cores .",
    "interestingly , we see almost no significant differences between masked and unmasked radial density profiles , as we show in figure  [ fig:1dprofile_comparemask ] . here",
    "we compare the unmasked _",
    "n - body mock _ and the _ masked 2lpt mocks _ to the _ cmass mid _ data sample .",
    "we do not plot stacks from the _ masked n - body mock _ since they simply overlap the exisiting curves but have larger scatter .",
    "the stacks shown here are the same as before in figure  [ fig:1dprofile_data ] .",
    "with very few exceptions , profiles from both the data and the full - volume mock sit within the range of profiles constructed in the different realizations of the masked mock .",
    "this agreement persists at all void scales .",
    "the two visible excursions from the mocks is consistent with statistical expectations . since radial density profiles by definition probe the interiors and immediate surroundings of voids ,",
    "they naturally are more robust against distortions due to the mask . also , the process of stacking turns sets of elliptical voids with different orientations into a roughly spherical shape , regardless of the distribution of the individual ellipticities  @xcite .",
    "thus any changes to the mean ellipticity due to the mask will not change the radial profiles significantly .    with the enormous number of voids in the _ n - body mock _ sample , we begin to see the transition from over- to under - compensated voids  @xcite .",
    "however , this transition is not clear in the data due to the lack of voids at these extreme scales .",
    "we have constructed a void catalog from the sdss dr9 cmass spectroscopic galaxy survey . combined with the voids from dr7 ,",
    "this is the largest void catalog to date .",
    "we have used previously - established methods for removing voids near survey boundaries to produce a catalog of voids with a fair distribution of shapes .",
    "this catalog also provides the most distant voids ever detected , extending our knowledge of galaxy underdensities to redshift @xmath28 .",
    "our voids have effective radii between 20 and 70 @xmath7mpc , and exhibit the same qualitatively universal radial density profile seen in earlier works  @xcite .",
    "we used halo occupation distribution modeling to produce mock catalogs for comparison purposes .",
    "we find that the effects of the mask are highly non - trivial and can depend strongly on the relative surface area of the mask compared to the volume , the depth of the survey , the number of internal holes , and the detailed shape of the boundary .",
    "cosmological statistics based on global void properties , such as number functions and ellipticity distributions , are especially vulnerable to the properties of the mask",
    ". however , we find that probes based on void _ interiors _ , such as radial density or velocity profiles , are generally more robust . also , cosmological applications which depend on the statistical isotropy of voids , such as the alcock - paczynski test  @xcite , are resilient . in cases such as this , while the mask may change the average void shape or size , as long as the mask preserves a uniform sampling of their orientations then the methods are sound .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite hypothesized that the so - called `` void phenomenon '' of peebles ( 2001 ) can be explained by galaxy bias .",
    "this has led to a general discussion in the literature about potential discrepancies between the voids in theory and voids in data . for the void definition",
    "we adopt , abundances , ellipticity distributions , and radial profiles all indicate that voids in simulations have the same sizes , shapes , and interior contents as observed voids once galaxy bias , sparsity , and survey masks are accounted for .",
    "overall , we find no significant discrepancies between observations of voids in the sdss dr9 and @xmath5cdm  mocks .",
    "we have made all the sdss dr9 voids , as well as all mock catalogs used in this work , publicly available online at the public cosmic void catalog at .",
