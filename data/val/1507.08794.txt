    "an interest to conformal field theories ( cft ) with extended nonlinear w - symmetry generated by the higher spin holomorphic currents has long history , starting from the original work @xcite .",
    "these theories resemble many features of ordinary cft ( with only virasoro symmetry ) , like free field representation and degenerate fields @xcite , but it already turns to be impossible to construct in generic situation their conformal blocks @xcite ( or the blocks for the algebra of higher spin w - currents ) which are the main ingredients in the bootstrap definition of the physical correlation functions .",
    "this interest has been seriously supported in the context of rather nontrivial correspondence between two - dimensional cft and four - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite , where the conformal blocks have to be compared with the nekrasov instanton partition functions @xcite producing in the quasiclassical limit the seiberg - witten prepotentials @xcite .",
    "this correspondence meets serious difficulties beyond the level of the @xmath0 gauge quivers on gauge theory side , i.e. for the higher rank gauge groups , which should correspond to the not yet defined generic blocks of the w - conformal theories .",
    "it is already clear , however , that the technique developed in two - dimensional cft can be applied to four - dimensional gauge theories , and vice versa .",
    "following @xcite we are going to demonstrate how it can save efforts for the computation of the exact conformal blocks for the twist fields in theories with w - symmetry .    even in the virasoro case",
    "generic conformal block is a very nontrivial special function @xcite , but there exists two important particular cases where the answer is known almost in explicit form  the correlation functions containing degenerate fields ( which are related to the integrals of hypergeometric type ) and the exact zamolodchikov blocks for a nontrivial ( though @xmath1 ) theory @xcite  .",
    "the first class can be generalized to the case of w - algebras , where similar hypergeometric formulas arise in the case of so - called completely degenerate fields @xcite .",
    "the algebraic definition still exists when degeneracy is not complete , and in this case the most effective way of computation comes from use of the gauge theory nekrasov functions .",
    "below we are going to study the w - analogs of the zamolodchikov conformal blocks , which do not belong to the class of algebraic ones .",
    "they can be nevertheless computed exactly , partially using the methods of gauge theories and corresponding integrable systems .",
    "we are going to demonstrate also their direct relations with exactly known isomonodromic @xmath2-functions @xcite , which confirms therefore their role as an important example of a generic w - block which can be possible defined ( for integer central charges ) in terms of corresponding isomonodromic problem @xcite .",
    "the exact conformal blocks of the w - algebras are closely related to the correlation functions of the twist fields , studied long ago in the context of perturbative string theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , the correlators of the twist fields in these papers were not really expressed through the conformal blocks , and therefore their relation to the w - algebras remained out of interest , so we are going to fill partially this gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ ss : twists ] we define the correlators of currents on sphere in presence of the twist fields , and show how they can be computed in terms of free conformal field theory on the cover . in sect .",
    "[ ss : wcharges ] we identify the twist fields with the primary fields of the w - algebra and propose a way to extract the values of their quantum numbers from the previously computed correlation functions of the currents .",
    "we also show there that these w - charges have obvious meaning in terms of the eigenvalues of the quasipermutation monodromy matrices . in sect .",
    "[ ss : sw ] we define the result for the exact conformal block in terms of integrable systems . in particular , we show that the main classical contribution to the result satisfies the well - known seiberg - witten ( sw ) period equation @xcite , moreover , in this case they can be immediately solved , which gives the most effective way to express the answer through the period matrix and the prime form on the covering surface .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ ss : isotau ] we discuss the connection of the w - algebra conformal blocks with the @xmath2-function of the isomonodromic problem , and show that the w - blocks we have constructed correspond in this context to the @xmath2-function for the case of quasipermutation monodromy data . in sect .",
    "[ ss : examples ] we construct some explicit examples , and some extra technical information ( the recursion procedure we have used for construction of correlators of the higher w - currents , the discussion of their ope with the stress - tensor , and the computation of the asymptotics of the period matrix on the cover and its relation with the structure constants in the expansion of the isomonodromic @xmath2-function ) is located in the appendix .",
    "we start now with the construction of the conformal blocks of @xmath3 algebra at integer virasoro central charges @xmath4 following the lines of @xcite .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that @xmath5 algebra has free - field representation in terms of @xmath6 bosonic fields with the currents @xmath7 satisfying operator product expansion ( ope ) j^a(z)j^b(z)=+reg . where @xmath8 is the scalar product in the cartan subalgebra @xmath9 .",
    "for the current @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the basis in @xmath12 , it is useful to introduce explicit components j_i(z)=(e_i , j(z ) ) ,  i=1,  ,n with @xmath13 being the weights of the first fundamental or vector representation , so that j_i(z)j_j(z)=+reg.=+reg .",

    "now we are going to introduce new fields @xmath20 , which are still primary for all high - spin currents @xmath21 , but not for the currents @xmath14 .",

    "the particular cases of this construction were known for the abelian monodromy group of the cover @xcite , but even there in the cases with @xmath25 they were not identified with @xmath5 primary fields .",
    "now we are going to construct the _ particular _ conformal block ( on @xmath26 with global coordinate @xmath27 ) , where all monodromy fields can be grouped as @xmath28 at @xmath29 , so that one can take an ope [ ope ] _ s(z)_s^-1(z)= _",

    "we should also point out that only local deformations of the positions of the branch points @xmath44 are allowed , since the global ones  due to nontrivial monodromies  can change the global structure of the cover @xmath35 .",
