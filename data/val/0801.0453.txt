    "a hot and dense state of matter , called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is believed to have formed during the first few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "its degrees of freedom above a critical temperature @xmath4 consist of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) was built to study the formation and properties of quark gluon plasma in collisions of heavy ions at very large energies .",
    "we have overwhelming evidence from the first few years of running of rhic that the temperatures reached are well above @xmath4 and that the new matter is indeed partonic @xcite .",
    "one of the key observations at rhic is the suppression of hadrons with large transverse momentum @xmath0 @xcite , most impressively manifested in reduced nuclear modification factors @xmath5 for hadrons in the most central collisions for @xmath6 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 measures the ratio of yields in nuclear collisions ( @xmath9 ) vs nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath10 ) at the same energy scaled with the appropriate number of binary collisions . high-@xmath0 hadrons above 5 gev/@xmath7 in @xmath9 collisions are believed to come predominantly from fragmentation off qcd jets .",
    "qcd jets originate from high-@xmath0 partons created in the initial hard collisions between the nucleons in the nuclei .",
    "the jet quenching phenomenon at rhic has been attributed to loss of energy of the high-@xmath0 partons on their way through the medium @xcite .",
    "it is often characterized by a transport coefficient @xmath11 , a ratio of the average squared momentum transfer @xmath12 per collision and the mean free path @xmath13 .",
    "initially , energy loss had been attributed to induced gluon radiation by scattering of the leading jet parton with thermal partons from the medium .",
    "perturbative calculations of this process yield results for @xmath8 compatible with data after fixing one parameter characterizing the strength of the interaction , the transport coefficient @xmath14 or an equivalent quantity . however , recently several inconsistencies have led to considerable efforts to revisit this topic .",
    "first , the values for the transport coefficients extracted from measurements of @xmath8 have large uncertainties and differ between the various theoretical models @xcite .",
    "second , the description of observables beyond those based on the simple single inclusive spectrum is far more problematic . as an example we mention the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath15 at high @xmath0 which is larger than predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "third , the application of radiative , perturbative energy loss to heavy quarks leads to the prediction of much smaller quenching than for light quarks , in contradiction with data from rhic @xcite .",
    "the partial failure of radiative , perturbative energy loss led to renewed interest in energy loss from elastic collisions @xcite , although a self - consistent treatment of elastic and radiative energy loss in one proper unified theoretical framework is still under construction .",
    "it has also ushered in a period of renewed interest in non - perturbative mechanisms .",
    "examples are energy loss through bound states in the plasma @xcite  successfully applied to heavy quarks  and energy loss in the infinite coupling limit of qcd , modeled through the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    in this work , we discuss the potential of flavor dependent measurements of jet quenching observables .",
    "it is obvious that the interaction of a jet with the medium can change the flavor of the jet  defined here as the flavor of the leading parton .",
    "we will show that this leads to observable differences in the final jet hadron chemistry .",
    "our generalized definition of flavor here includes light quarks @xmath16 ( @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 ) , gluons @xmath20 , and photons @xmath21 .",
    "heavy flavors @xmath22 ( @xmath7 and @xmath23 ) should also be included .",
    "there is no doubt that flavor changing processes exist for fast partons coupling to a medium .",
    "indeed , flavor changing channels have been included in computations of medium - modified fragmentation functions @xcite , and quark - gluon conversions of the leading jet particle are also implemented in the amy formalism @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , flavor changing processes are often neglected in phenomenological studies .",
    "this situation led to the wide - spread opinion that quark and gluon jets are well - defined concepts in a medium and that they ought to exhibit a relative suppression by a color factor @xmath24 .",
    "this claim might have some validity in the case that the mean - free path of the leading particle is of the order of ( or larger than ) the size of the medium , @xmath25 .",
    "energy loss is then dominated by emission of only one gluon . in general",
    ", however , the situation is different .",
    "we want to emphasize that the flavor of a leading parton might only be well - defined locally and that it can change along the trajectory .",
    "recently , sapeta and wiedemann argued that changes in jet chemistry could also arise from the increased multiplicity in medium - modified jets @xcite . in a model using enhanced parton branching they find effects similar to those discussed by us here .",
    "nevertheless , most studies of jets in nuclear matter still focus solely on the _ kinematical _ effects , based on quenching of longitudinal momentum and broadening of transverse momentum of the leading parton .",
    "e.g. , observables like @xmath8 and @xmath15 are sensitive to various integrals over the differential energy loss @xmath26 and ultimately measure the momentum transfer per path length , i.e.  @xmath14",
    ". we can summarize this as the effect of jets coupling to the _ thermal _ properties of the medium .",
    "we like to advocate a second , complementary approach which looks at _ flavor _ effects from jets coupling to the _ chemical _ properties of the medium .",
    "measurements of identified hadrons at high-@xmath0 can constrain the rate of conversions . with sufficient experimental sensitivity this would lead to estimates for the mean free path @xmath13 of the jet in the medium , complementary to measurements of @xmath14 .",
    "we expect such measurements to provide additional stringent tests for the validity of any model for the jet - medium coupling . of course , with any novel observation different explanations have to be taken into account .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will discuss all relevant conversion channels on a qualitative level and assess their relative importance .",
    "we focus on jets interacting with a deconfined quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions , but our arguments can be easily applied to cold or hot hadronic matter as well .",
    "we then proceed to present numerical results for rhic and lhc in a consistent model based on rate equations for conversions and a fokker - planck equation for energy loss , using perturbative leading - order ( lo ) cross sections .",
    "the formalism is introduced in sec .",
    "[ propagate ] while a discussion of the results can be found in secs .",
    "iv and v. we focus on light and strange quarks , and real photons .",
    "conversions including heavy quarks will not affect the abundance of light species and photons measurably .",
    "therefore , the effect on charm and bottom spectra will be addressed in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "we will also introduce some novel double - ratio observables that might be particularly sensitive to conversion processes .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "let us start by discussing possible flavor conversion processes in a leading order perturbative approach .",
    "annihilation and pair creation processes ( i ) @xmath27 can lead to a conversion of quarks into gluons and vice versa . in the following",
    "we agree that the first parton mentioned on either side of an arrow @xmath28 or @xmath29 is the leading jet parton in the sense that it is the one with the larger momentum with respect to the local rest frame of the medium among all other partons on the same side of the arrow .",
    "@xmath16 can be a quark or antiquark and @xmath30 is its antiparticle .",
    "photons can be easily created through ( ii ) @xmath31 and ( iii ) @xmath32 .",
    "note that we can neglect the opposite processes and generally all processes with photons in the initial state for obvious reasons .",
    "it is also safe to ignore @xmath33 which in our notation contributes to the yield of gluon jets , but is much suppressed compared to the annihilation contribution ( i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "flavor changing compton processes ( iv ) @xmath34 are as important as annihilation and pair creation .",
    "compton processes also contribute to photon production via ( v ) @xmath35 .",
    "let us comment on the fate of heavy quarks .",
    "heavy quark annihilation is negligible at realistic temperatures , but the opposite process ( vi ) @xmath36 might be an important source of excess heavy quarks . the compton process for heavy quarks ( vii ) @xmath37 is interesting as well since it can effectively accelerate heavy quarks from the medium or decelerate existing fast heavy quarks .",
    "we will report on the quantitative effects of processes involving heavy quarks in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "some of the conversion channels ( i ) to ( v ) have been investigated in the past . in @xcite",
    "the authors discussed the conversion of quark into gluon jets and vice versa through annihilation and compton channels ( i ) and ( iv ) , respectively . in the absence of flavor conversions the relative suppression of gluon relative to quark jets",
    "is expected to be 9/4 .",
    "conversions reduce the difference between the nuclear modification factors for high-@xmath0 quarks and gluons . assuming gluon dominated proton fragmentation functions , as given in modern parameterizations @xcite , this leads to an enhancement of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 ratios at high transverse momentum .",
    "this is supported by recent data from the star collaboration at rhic @xcite which shows rather large @xmath38 ratios in au+au at high @xmath0 .",
    "models without conversion predict consistently lower @xmath38 and @xmath40 ratios @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in @xcite the required conversion rates were found to be much larger than those given by the leading order perturbative calculation .",
    "an enhancement factor ( @xmath41 ) was necessary to describe the data . although there are some uncertainties from the fragmentation functions this either points to large higher order corrections @xcite or to a non - perturbative mechanism favored in a strongly coupled qgp scenario @xcite .",
    "it was first pointed out in @xcite that annihilation and compton processes can also lead to the conversion of a quark or gluon jet into a photon .",
    "perturbative estimates of this process at leading order indicate a sizable contribution to the total direct photon yield at intermediate @xmath0 between 3 and 6 gev/@xmath7 at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the same was found for the production of virtual photons and lepton pairs @xcite .",
    "measurements of single inclusive direct photon production from the phenix experiment @xcite are not conclusive so far . the data has been described equally well within error bars both by calculations taking into account only prompt hard photons and thermal photons , and by calculations adding jet - photon conversions as well @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also noticed that jet - photon conversions lead to photons with an azimuthal asymmetry @xmath15 which is negative w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath15 of hadrons and other photon sources @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was estimated that the sum of all direct photon sources leads to small and negative direct photon @xmath15 between 3 and 5% at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "however , later it was noted that the result depends crucially on details of the fireball simulation and might be much closer to zero @xcite .",
    "first experimental results are compatible with zero with sizable uncertainties @xcite",
    ".    the current experimental situation can be summarized by noting that both for conversions into photons and for quark - gluon conversions no final conclusion has been reached about a direct observation of these channels .",
    "this should change in the future with extended hadron identification capabilities at rhic and increased statistics for direct photons .",
    "of course , the experimental confirmation of one conversion signal would be a strong indication that conversion in general , as advocated here , is an important process .    in the remainder of the paper we present a calculation of conversion channels ( i),(ii),(vi ) and ( v ) in one consistent framework .",
    "we are going to compute nuclear modification factors @xmath8 for pions , kaons and direct photons , and the elliptic flow @xmath15 of direct photons .",
    "this leads to a direct quantitative connection between the conversions into photons @xcite and conversions into gluons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we suggest the relative yield of strange hadrons at high @xmath0 as a new signature for jet medium coupling .",
    "the ratio of @xmath19 quarks to the sum of @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , @xmath42 is about 5% for the initial leading jet particle at rhic energies at a typical @xmath0 of about 10 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "it can be easily traced back to the small fraction of strange quarks in the incident nucleons . a rough estimate with cteq5 m parton distributions @xcite , assuming dominance of compton channels in the initial hard scattering",
    "would give @xmath43 consistent with the result from the full calculation . on the other hand , in a chemically equilibrated quark gluon plasma at a given temperature @xmath44",
    "the ratio is @xmath45 assuming massless @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks . for a strange quark mass of @xmath46",
    "mev the ratio is almost 1/2 even at @xmath47 mev : @xmath48 .",
    "the difference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is rather large and we have to expect that the relative abundance of strange quark jets will rise with time .    for an infinite medium the particle ratios of the jets would equilibrate to that of the medium",
    "( the same will happen to their momentum distribution , making them indistinguishable from the medium ) .",
    "for a finite path length @xmath51 , the rate of equilibration should be a good measure of the strength of the coupling to the medium .",
    "in particular , it should give a good estimate of the mean free path @xmath13 between flavor changing scatterings . the approach to equilibrium",
    "will be determined by the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the final parton abundances , once a jet leaves the medium , will translate into hadron abundances as given by the fragmentation process .",
    "our poor knowledge of fragmentation functions limits our ability to make precise predictions for absolute hadron ratios .",
    "hence , we propose to use double ratios of abundances measured in @xmath9 and @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the first ratio we are going to look at is that for direct photons relative to pions @xmath53 note that formally this is the same as @xmath54 . in such double ratios uncertainties from the determination of the number of @xmath10 collisions ( needed for @xmath8 ) cancel . on the theoretical side",
    "the large uncertainties from fragmentation functions tend to cancel between the @xmath9 and the @xmath1 contribution . on the experimental side",
    ", we would hope that the systematic errors for a direct extraction of double ratios are smaller than for an a posteriori reconstruction from single ratios .",
    "we will also take a fresh look at the relative abundances of protons and pions @xmath55    generally , in @xmath9 collisions we expect the relative abundances of flavors to tend toward equilibrium values .",
    "therefore , we expect an increase of photons compared to quark and gluons and we expect an increase of gluons relative to quarks @xcite . under the assumption that protons are dominated by fragmentation from gluons",
    "we expect the @xmath38 ratio to increase in @xmath9 collisions , while @xmath56 will show an even steeper increase .",
    "a similar increase should also be observed in the relative abundance of strange hadrons as high-@xmath0 strange quarks tend toward equilibrium . in the remainder of the paper we will try to verify our claims numerically .",
    "our treatment of a fast quark or gluon in a qgp medium has already been discussed in ref .",
    "the behavior is governed by coupled fokker - planck equations and rate equations @xmath57 with letters @xmath58 denoting quark , antiquark , gluon , or photon .",
    "we have dropped the diffusion term and also neglected the dispersion of jet momentum , i.e.  @xmath59 since we want to focus on high momentum jets .",
    "the drag coefficient @xmath60 is obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite , including all elastic processes between quarks and gluons . to mimic the contributions from higher order radiative processes , we introduce an enhancement factor @xmath61 .",
    "the conversion widths @xmath62 for quark to gluon and vice versa ( channels ( i ) and ( iv ) ) are extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite as well , multiplied by the same enhancement factor @xmath61 to account for higher order corrections .",
    "the widths for the quark to photon processes ( ii ) and ( v ) at leading order are obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a quark or gluon jet moving through the qgp , the rate of change for its mean transverse momentum @xmath63 can be obtained from the fokker - planck equation in ( [ fpeq ] ) .",
    "a quark or gluon can be converted to a gluon , quark or photon with a rate given by the corresponding collisional width .",
    "these effects are modeled by introducing a large number of test quark and gluon jets that are distributed in the transverse plane according to the underlying binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "their transverse momentum distribution is taken to be uniform in azimuthal angle @xmath64 . a test jet of a given kind with certain transverse momentum is assigned a probability that is proportional to the corresponding jet momentum spectrum with the proportionality constant determined by requiring that the sum of the probabilities for all test jets of this kind is equal to their total number .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "let us quickly discuss the possible lessons that can be learned by looking at a simplified situation .",
    "we assume a rare jet flavor which can be produced from a plentiful reservoir of a second jet flavor via a single channel with width @xmath65 .",
    "as long as the first flavor stays rare the back - reaction is negligible .",
    "a real world example close to this hypothetical situation could be photons produced from light quark jets at rhic . then the rate to produce an additional excess of the rare flavor",
    "is @xmath66 let us further assume that @xmath67 is roughly constant during the lifetime of jets in the system ( as for the real world example : up to 30% of quark jets at rhic leak to gluon jets @xcite ) .",
    "then we arrive at a simple formula connecting yields and the mean free path for the single channel .",
    "@xmath68    obviously , realistic systems are more complicated with multiple channels , changing rates @xmath62 due to the temperature evolution of the system , and a whole range of possible path lengths @xmath51",
    ". therefore , in the following section we will apply our test particle monte carlo simulation to study the propagation of jets in an expanding qgp fireball .",
    "in @xmath1 collisions , direct photons come from initial hard collisions and vacuum bremsstrahlung off jets .",
    "bremsstrahlung photons can be obtained by folding the qcd with photon fragmentation functions @xmath69 from ref .",
    "the spectra of quark and gluon jets are taken from @xcite which fit both pion and proton spectra measured in @xmath1 collisions from star , while the prompt initial photons are calculated at leading order according to @xcite with a @xmath61 factor of 1.5 .",

    "[ spectra_pp ] , and it is found to be in good agreement with data from phenix @xcite at transverse momenta above 4 gev/@xmath7 . this provides a well controlled baseline for calculations of the nuclear modification factor @xmath71 .",
    "the yield of additional direct photons in au+au collisions from jets in the medium is computed by applying the test particle monte carlo method discussed above . for the dynamics of the fireball in central collisions",

    "this rather large value is likely to establish an upper bound for the effect , but it is also compatible with the previous work in @xcite .",
    "of course , taking such a large value would imply that a leading order perturbative treatment is not sufficient to begin with .",

    "jet flavor conversions reduce the number of high momentum quark jets by 30% @xcite .",
    "therefore , conversions lead to a decreased production of direct photons from final state jet fragmentation ( dotted lines in both left panel and right panel ) by roughly the same amount .",

    "we find a noticeable difference between both cases . in our calculation",

    "note that the difference between both scenarios decreases with increasing transverse momentum because prompt hard photons from initial scatterings , unchanged by the nuclear environment , dominate at higher @xmath0 .",

    "the elliptic flow of photons from jet - photon conversions is negative with a magnitude of about 2% , because the production of direct photons in the direction out of the reaction plane is favored by the longer propagation path of jets through the medium @xcite .",

    "when the centrality of the collisions increases , the resulting decreased average path length will lead to reduction of both energy loss and jet conversion rates .",
    "hence we expect that the difference between the scenarios with and without jet conversions for the double ratio @xmath105 will shrink with increasing centrality . for the elliptic flow of direct photons ,",
    "the centrality dependence is not so straight forward to estimate because changes in energy loss and jet conversion rates try to sway @xmath15 in different directions .",

    "direct photons from jet - photon conversions and jet fragmentation dominate below @xmath117 gev/@xmath7 when conversions are switched on , with photons from conversion being the largest source below 10 gev/@xmath7 . without jet conversions the direct photons from jet fragmentation are always brighter than those from initial hard collisions up to 20 gev/@xmath7 , because of the reduced conversion of quarks .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the nuclear modification factor @xmath71 , which is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ lhc_raa ] .",
    "the difference between both scenarios can be as large as a factor of 2 at @xmath118 gev/@xmath7 , and decreases to a factor of about 1.25 at 20 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "we also observe a large increase in the double ratio @xmath119 if conversions are included , just as seen for rhic as well . for comparison",
    ", we also show the result of the double ratio @xmath120 at lhc .    since we have seen that direct photons at lhc are mostly from jet - photon conversions and final state jet fragmentation , they are strongly influenced by jet conversions .",
    "photon elliptic flow @xmath104 might reveal those large effects .",
    "the parameters of the fireball formed in peripheral collisions at lhc are extracted from information about centrality , number of participants , and number of binary collisions in pb+pb collisions at @xmath70= 5.5= tev @xcite . for simplicity , in collisions at lhc within the centrality bin @xmath121%",
    ", we use the same geometric parameters ( the length of the long and short axes ) for the initial fireball as at rhic , but we set the initial temperature and proper time of qgp formation to @xmath103 = 700 mev and @xmath77 = 0.2 fm / c , respectively , consistent with central collisions . the time dependence of the temperature is also fixed via entropy conservation .    in fig .",
    "[ lhc_v_2 ] we show the resulting elliptic flow @xmath104 of direct photons in pb+pb collisions at @xmath122 = 5.5 tev with and without conversions . the elliptic flow from photon fragmentation off jets is positive with a magnitude of  2% in the case of jet conversions , but it is reduced by a factor of 2 in the case of missing jet conversions due to the reduced quenching for quark .",
    "the resulting total elliptic flow of direct photons without jet conversions differs only slightly from that of jet fragmentation alone , since direct prompt photons from the initial state are subdominant below 20 gev/@xmath7 . with",
    "jet conversions included , we again observe a cancellation between the negative anisotropy from jet - photon conversions and the increase in jet fragmentation with positive anisotropy , leading to a total elliptic flow @xmath104 of almost the same magnitude as that without jet conversions . together with our previous result at rhic energies this might indicate that photon elliptic flow , despite its early promise , might need very large experimental precision to be used as a probe .",
    "the situation might be much improved , however , if measurements with additional isolation cuts could be made @xcite .",

    "the numerical results confirm once more that the total elliptic flow of direct photons at high transverse momentum varies only weakly with the centrality of the collision .     for @xmath109 in @xmath123 collisions at @xmath70=5.5 tev as function of transverse momentum.,width=288,height=288 ]    in fig .",
    "[ lhc_raa_k0 ] we show @xmath108 of @xmath109 in central collisions at lhc .",
    "we observe that jet conversions have only a small impact on @xmath108 .",
    "this had to be expected , because initial jet production is gluon dominated and strange quark jets are not very much suppressed to begin with , very unlike the situation found at rhic .",
    "the impact of jet conversions on the @xmath8 of kaons is similar to the effect on pions at lhc @xcite .",
    "we conclude that strange hadrons might not be a good probe of jet conversions any more at lhc energies .",
    "we studied the impact of flavor conversions of jets on observables in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we argued that the relaxation of jet flavors toward chemical equilibrium can be an independent measure for the strength of the jet - medium coupling .",
    "we presented a computation of several observables which are sensitive to conversion processes at rhic and lhc using a fokker - planck approach and coupled rate equations for conversions .",
    "rates were based on leading order cross sections with a @xmath61 factor .",
    "we find a large change in the nuclear modification factor @xmath71 when jet conversions are switched on , while the effects on photonic elliptic flow @xmath104 tend to cancel .",
    "we find our results to be consistent with the available experimental data from phenix @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the impact of jet conversions on the double ratios of nuclear modification factor @xmath124 and @xmath125 and find that these quantities are quite sensitive to the presence of jet conversions .",
    "the difference can be as large as a factor of two . at the same time",
    "such double ratios might be extracted from experimental data with rather small systematic error bars .",
    "large @xmath61-factors in our leading order treatment would hint at non - perturbative mechanisms , or to the presence of additional effects , like the influence of increased multiplicities in modified jets @xcite .",
    "we also advocate the measurement of strange hadrons at high @xmath0 as a possible signature for the jet - medium coupling .",
    "the low initial strange quark content of jets at rhic makes kaons and other strange hadrons a a very sensitive probe for the coupling to the medium .",
