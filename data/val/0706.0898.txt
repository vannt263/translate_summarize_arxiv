    "quasar absorption lines provide us with a unique tool to probe the gas content in the universe .",
    "they offer an unmatched sensitivity up to high redshift , allow us to detect arbitrarily faint objects , and constrain the gas distribution in velocity space .",
    "however , the lack of direct spatial information tends to be a limitation for understanding the nature of these systems and fundamental questions still remain .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to relate the gas distribution to that of other components such as dark matter , stars and dust by measuring their cross - correlations .",
    "galactic environments have been studied using various types of absorption lines . among metal lines ,",
    "the  doublet , @xmath9 , has been extensively used due to the strength and wavelength of the transitions making it easily detectable from the ground at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "mgii turns out to be a sensitive tracer of galactic environment : it arises in gas spanning more than five decades of neutral hydrogen column density ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it has been shown that the detection of a strong mgii absorber indicates the presence of a nearby @xmath11 galaxy along the line - of - sight ( @xcite ) , and at low redshift @xcite have shown that strong mgii absorbers are good tracers of damped lyman alpha systems . for reviews of the progress on the determination of these systems ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    recently , the size and homogeneity the sdss has allowed several statistical analyzes to be done : @xcite measured the cross - correlation between @xmath12 luminous red galaxies and mgii absorbers . @xcite investigated the distribution of absorber impact parameters and the emission properties of mgii related galaxies .",
    "they have shown that a cross - correlation between light and gas can be detected up to 200 kpc and that stronger absorbers are related to bluer galaxies .",
    "the sdss has also provided us with closely separated quasar pairs allowing us to analyze the spectrum of background quasars to probe the gas distribution around foreground ones @xcite .",
    "such a technique allows us to compare the gaseous halos of quasars and galaxies and it can ultimately be used to test the quasar unification scheme on large scales @xcite",
    ".    however , despite significant observational progress fundamental questions such as the nature of the gas seen in absorption and its spatial distribution still remain .",
    "more importantly , we still do not understand the process(es ) responsible for the observed values of mgii rest equivalent widths .",
    "as strong mgii absorbers are known to be tracers of galaxies , they are expected to induce gravitational lensing and reddening effects to the light of their background quasars .",
    "correlations between quasar magnitudes and the presence or strength of metal lines can therefore be used in order to quantify the relationships between gas , dark matter and dust .",
    "such an approach also allows us to quantify the extinction and magnification biases in samples of optically selected quasars .",
    "the presence of dust associated with various types of absorbers has been reported by many authors : @xcite & @xcite found quasars with dlas to be on average redder than quasars without .",
    "@xcite observed a similar effect with civ absorption lines . using the 2df survey @xcite found evidence of reddening due to strong mgii systems .",
    "@xcite showed that a fraction of sdss quasars are reddened with smc - type dust and argued that this effect comes predominantly from dust located at the quasar redshifts . using the sdss database ,",
    "@xcite found an e(b - v)@xmath13 associated with caii absorbers , and @xcite & @xcite measured the mean reddening effects of about 800 quasars with @xmath14 mgii absorbers .",
    "constraints on dust can also be obtained by measuring the relative abundances of volatile and refractory elements in order to infer a depletion level ( e.g. ) .    while the presence of dust reddening associated with metal absorbers",
    "has been convincingly shown , its detailed properties ( dependencies on redshift , rest equivalent width , etc . )",
    "need to be quantified in order to understand the underlying physics and connect theory to observations .",
    "the presence of dust along given lines - of - sight also implies the existence of a dust obscuration bias that can affect quasar and absorber number counts . using 75 radio - selected quasars ,",
    "@xcite investigated such an effect and did not find any difference ( at the 20% level ) between the incidence of mgii absorbers in radio - selected and optically - selected quasars .",
    "this result shows that _ in general _ optically - selected quasars are not strongly affected by an extinction bias , but it does not provide us with the full information : it does not show how the shape of the observed distribution of absorber rest equivalent widths is affected by dust extinction .    in order to unveil the relationships between extinction and absorption properties , we present a new analysis based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) using the fourth data release ( dr4 ) .",
    "after having quantified the efficiency of the sdss pipeline to detect reddened quasars , we use a sample of about 7,000 mgii absorbers  i.e. almost an order of magnitude larger than previous studies  to measure the excess reddening induced by these systems and investigate its dependence on absorption rest equivalent width and redshift .",
    "in addition to cause reddening effects , the presence of a galaxy along the line - of - sight is expected to give rise to gravitational lensing effects .",
    "several cases of strong gravitational lensing of quasars due to an absorbing galaxy are known ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , in general , the impact parameters of mgii absorbers are larger than a few kpc and gravitational lensing effects occur in the weak regime and solely change quasar magnitudes ( @xcite )",
    ". the detection of such an effect would ultimately allow us to constrain the mass of mgii systems .",
    "several authors have attempted to detect the statistical magnification induced by mgii systems .",
    "some have looked for redshift distribution changes ( @xcite ) but did not find any compelling evidence for gravitational lensing .",
    "others have investigated the occurrence of metal absorbers ( civ , siiv , mgii ) on bright and faint quasars ( @xcite ) and reported possible magnification effects for certain absorber species only .",
    "@xcite used the 2df - quasar survey to compare the number of quasars with and without mgii absorbers as a function of magnitude and reported a relative excess of optically bright radio - selected quasars with absorbers as well as indications of reddening effects .",
    "murphy & liske ( 2004 ) applied the same method to a sample of damped lyman-@xmath15 systems and reported a similar trend found at 2@xmath16 . using radio - selected quasars , @xcite reported a possible excess of optically bright quasars with mgii absorbers , and more recently @xcite found that quasars with high - redshift dlas are on average brighter than quasars without .",
    "the various results found among all these analyzes turn out to be rather difficult to combine because the absorber species , redshift and equivalent width ranges differ .",
    "in addition , as noted in some of these analyzes , biases due to selection effects can mimic the lensing signal : it is easier to detect absorption lines in high quality ( or high s / n ) spectra , however , these spectra tend to correspond to bright objects . this selection bias results in a preference for detecting absorption lines in brighter quasars , which is an effect similar to the signal of interest .",
    "unfortunately , none of these works could convincingly demonstrate that the level of such systematics was sufficiently low in their analysis , leaving the amplitude of lensing effects rather uncertain .",
    "in this paper we attempt to make a significant improvement in making such a measurement by overcoming the problem of systematic effects using monte carlo simulations and by reaching a much higher precision thanks to the size and homogeneity of the sdss .",
    "we use a robust semi - automatic absorption line finder algorithm , carefully select a population of reference quasars , test potential biases , and use monte carlo simulations to measure and quantify the level of systematics of our selection procedure . to detect a magnification signal we will apply the method proposed by @xcite and look for a correlation between the presence of absorbers and a change in the mean magnitude of their background quasars .",
    "contrarily to previous studies , this approach allows the use of a non - parametric estimator .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ section_formalism ] we introduce the formalism of dust extinction and gravitational magnification .",
    "we describe the data used in our analysis in  [ section_data ] as well as the selection of the different samples of quasars . the magnitude shifts and color changes due to the presence of absorbers along quasar",
    "lines - of - sight are presented in  [ section_results ] .",
    "we discuss the results and conclude in  [ section_conclusion ] .",
    "strong mgii absorbers ( usually defined with @xmath17  ) are known to be tracers of galaxies with luminosities ranging from 0.1 to several @xmath18 .",
    "the presence of such a system seen along the line - of - sight of a background source can therefore modify its brightness in two ways : first , the presence of dust in and/or around the absorber can extinct and redden the source s light and second , it can act as a gravitational lens and amplify the flux of the source .",
    "this can be described by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the observed flux of a source behind an absorber , @xmath21 is the flux that would be observed without intervening system , @xmath22 is the optical depth for extinction induced by the galaxy and @xmath23 the gravitational amplification .",
    "the corresponding magnitude change can then be written m & = & m - m _ + & = & -2.5()+_. [ eq:2 ] these two contributions have different wavelength and redshift contributions .",
    "one can therefore attempt to constrain them separately .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the observed mean magnitude difference between a population of quasars with absorbers and one without : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnitude in a given band @xmath26 . in the next section",
    "we will measure this quantity using a large sample of mgii absorbers from the sdss .",
    "we will then investigate how @xmath27 varies as a function of absorber rest equivalent width and redshift .",
    "similarly , we can then define the mean excess color @xmath28 where @xmath26 and @xmath29 denote two different bands .",
    "it should be noted that such a quantity is not sensitive to gravitational lensing effects as it no longer depends on the magnification @xmath23 .",
    "it can be used to probe the statistical properties of the extinction curve of absorbers systems as well as the dust column densities as a function of absorber rest equivalent width .",
    "+ in optical surveys , sources like quasars are both magnitude and color selected .",
    "when dust extinction occurs , such sources can become undetectable because they become too faint and/or too red .",
    "as long as sources are no longer detectable because of a limiting magnitude and not because of a color cut , we have @xmath30 however , if the sources become undetectable because they no longer satisfy a color cut , the measured reddening is then lower than the intrinsic one .",
    "such a property depends on the details of the quasar selection procedure and will be addressed in section [ section_reddening_bias ] .",
    "+ the current study is based on the photometry of sdss quasars using the @xmath31 filter set . however , historically people have quantified color excesses using the johnson @xmath32 and @xmath33 filters . in order to be able to present our results in similar units ,",
    "we provide here a list of useful conversions .",
    "first , it should be noted that previous statistical studies ( @xcite ) have indicated that , on average , the extinction curves of mgii selected galaxies are consistent with that of the smc , i.e. do not present an excess around the rest frame wavelength of 0.2@xmath34 ( in the optical , such a feature can only be detected for systems at redshift greater than @xmath35 and is therefore irrelevant for lower redshift galaxies ) . in this paper",
    "we will therefore consider only smc - type extinction curves .",
    "we will also see in section ",
    "[ section_results ] that such a property is confirmed by the present analysis .    in the range 0.1 to 1 @xmath34 , the smc extinction curvedraine ]",
    "can be very well approximated by a power law @xmath36 @xcite . by using the @xmath37 and @xmath38 filters",
    ", the conversion between the two color systems therefore reads @xmath39 and the average wavelengths for a flat spectrum are given by @xmath40 @xmath41 nm . using the effective wavelength for realistic quasar spectra does not change the results significantly . in practice ,",
    "two frames are interesting for considering colors excesses : in order to quantify the fraction of sources missed because of an extinction bias , _ observed _ e(b - v ) values are relevant . however , for estimating the amount of dust associated with an absorber system the _ rest frame _ e(b - v ) is the quantity of interest . for an smc - like extinction curve we have @xmath42 in a given band , we will therefore observe almost four times more extinction by an absorber at @xmath43 than the same system located at @xmath44 .",
    "for an smc extinction curve we also have @xmath45 where the proportionality coefficient @xmath46 depends on the redshift of the dust and varies from 3.2 to 2.0 when @xmath47 is in the range 0.5 to 2.0 , with a mean value of 2.6 .      in this section",
    "we show how magnification effects can ( or can not ) affect the observed magnitude of distant sources like quasars . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the original discussion presented in @xcite .    here",
    "we will first assume that extinction effects can be neglected ( which is expected at sufficiently large wavelengths ) .",
    "let us consider an area of the sky which is large enough for the mean magnification to be close to unity . in this area ,",
    "let us consider a population of sources , with a fraction @xmath48 of them lying behind an absorber system .",
    "we will write the magnitude distribution of the sources behind absorbers @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for the non - absorbed sources .",
    "we then have the following relation between the magnitude number counts : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the induced magnitude shift and @xmath53 is the probability density to have a given value of @xmath52 along a quasar line - of - sight .",
    "note that in the case of absorber systems , @xmath48 is not known .",
    "observational estimates of the number density of absorbers are necessarily affected by lensing and/or extinction effects due to the need of background quasars to observe absorber systems .",
    "therefore the only usable information from the previous equation comes from the shape of the distribution @xmath54 , i.e. its moments . in this paper",
    "we will focus only on the first moment , i.e. we will attempt to constrain the mean magnification and extinction effects by measuring the mean magnitude shift induced by the presence of absorber systems .    by defining @xmath55 and @xmath56 to be the observed mean magnitudes of the two quasar populations",
    ", we see that the _",
    "observable _ mean magnitude shift @xmath57 ( eq . [ eq_magnitude_shift ] ) can be used to probe the unknown distribution @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to note that the _ observed_-magnitude changes @xmath57 depend on both the magnification effects _ and _ the slope of the source luminosity distribution : @xmath58\\times \\delta m\\,,\\ ] ] and in general we have @xmath59 . for sdss quasars with @xmath60",
    ", @xcite has shown that we have @xmath61 where @xmath52 is an achromatic magnitude change .",
    "for a limiting magnitude of @xmath62 , we find @xmath63 .",
    "+ it should be noted that if the number of sources as a function of luminosity follows a power law then @xmath64 and magnitude changes can not be observed whatever the value of the induced magnitude shift @xmath52 .",
    "this absence of observable lensing effects can be understood in the following way : gravitational magnification makes each source brighter but allows also new sources to be detectable as they become brighter than the limiting magnitude of a given survey .",
    "this latter effect increases the number of faint sources and tends to diminish the mean flux of the detected objects . for a power law luminosity distribution ,",
    "the flux increase due to magnification is exactly canceled by the additional faint sources that enter the sample due to magnification , and lensing effects due to absorbers can not be observed .",
    "therefore , it is possible to detect changes in the magnitude distribution of a population lensed by absorbers only if its unlensed number counts depart from a power law as a function of luminosity .",
    "extinction effects will be affected in a similar way but the ability to observe sources in different bands allows us to measure reddening effects and then infer the related extinction .",
    "in order to isolate the magnitude changes due to the presence of intervening absorber systems we need to compare the magnitude of quasars with absorption lines to that of a reference quasar population .",
    "defining such a reference population without introducing any selection bias is a difficult task .",
    "indeed , the detection of absorption lines depends on quasar redshift , spectrum s / n , and the extinction and reddening effects they might induce on their background source .",
    "all these effects have to be taken into account in order to carefully select a population of reference quasars .",
    "the first requirement is to work with a well defined sample of quasars . among the large sample of quasars available from the sdss dr4 sample ( @xmath6550,000 )",
    ", we will use the primary spectroscopic quasar sample , i.e. quasars with @xmath66 ( @xmath6529,000 ) , as the selection of these objects is based on a well defined series of color cuts @xcite .",
    "we will not make use of fainter quasars ( observed with sdss serendipity fibers ) as they are not selected from well defined selection criteria . before characterizing the absorber systems used in this study",
    ", the first step of our analysis will be to investigate the sensitivity of the sdss quasar target algorithm to reddening and extinction .",
    "evidence for the presence of dust associated with mgii absorbers has already been shown by several authors by isolating the reddening and extinction effects they induce .",
    "since the selection of quasars depends on quasar magnitudes and colors @xcite , such an effect might introduce a bias in the object selection and it is therefore important to quantify it . in this section",
    "we now investigate the sensitivity of the sdss quasar target algorithm @xcite to reddening and extinction ( similarly to the analysis done by * ? ? ?",
    "in order to do so we use montecarlo - like simulations to test the ability of the sdss quasar algorithm to detect quasars for different amounts of reddening and extinction .",
    "we proceed as follows :    1 .   we use a sample of quasars without strong mgii absorber ( as described in section [ section_selection ] ) , consider the smc extinction curve and apply various amounts of extinction .",
    "we quantify the amount of reddening with the @xmath67 excess .",
    "2 .   the applied extinction will cause some objects to drop out of the input quasar sample as they become too faint and/or their colors no longer satisfy the series of selection criteria of the sdss quasar selection algorithm , considering only non - radio and point sources .",
    "we reject the objects no longer labeled as quasars by the sdss pipeline .",
    "3 .   for each value of @xmath67 applied , we measure the fraction of quasars missed due to limiting magnitude and color cuts effects , we measure the mean @xmath68 and @xmath47 magnitudes of the re - observed quasars and compare them to those of the initial sample of unreddened quasars .",
    "we illustrate some of the results of this procedure in fig .",
    "[ plot_magnitude_grid ] . from top to bottom we show the ability of the sdss quasar selection algorithm to select quasars with increasing reddening and show the effects on quasar magnitudes . in each case",
    "we present the @xmath68 and @xmath47-band magnitude distributions of the original ( solid line histograms ) and reddened samples ( filled histograms ) .",
    "these panels show that the fraction of quasars missed due to dust extinction becomes substantial for observed reddening values of @xmath67 larger than 0.2 . in this figure",
    "we also show the mean magnitude of each sample with a vertical line . as the amount of extinction increases",
    ", we can easily observe reddening effects rising as the mean magnitude shifts are more pronounced in bluer bands . in addition , we can observe that the mean magnitude in the @xmath47 band is almost unaffected by reddening in the range considered here .",
    "we present the summary of the completeness and reddening results in figure [ plot_gordon_mag_shift ] . from top to bottom we show , as a function of @xmath67 , the input extinction , the measured extinction and the fraction of objects that can be detected .",
    "these results show that the observed extinction , defined as the difference between the mean magnitude of the reddened quasars and those of the initial sample , is always smaller than the induced extinction .",
    "as explained in section [ section_lensing ] , such an effect is expected and is due to the shape of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "moreover , we can see that the observed mean @xmath47-band magnitude is not significantly affected by extinction effects ( for the range of reddening values of interest in this analysis ) .",
    "this property allows us to use the @xmath47 band to constrain gravitational lensing effects .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure allows us to quantify the fraction of objects missed as a function of observed @xmath67 . by knowing the amount of reddening induced by a class of absorber systems one can use this curve to infer the fraction of objects missed by the sdss quasar finder .    in the right panel of figure [ plot_gordon_mag_shift ] , we show another property related to the selection of reddened quasars : the induced and measured _ colors _ are the same in the range of reddening values of interest in our case , i.e. with @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates that the fraction of quasars lost due to color cuts is small .",
    "this property therefore allows us to measure the mean color excess of a sample of quasars and use the corresponding color value to infer the induced extinction . + the properties and selection biases of the sdss target quasar algorithm will be used below to interpret the measurements .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the main sample of sdss spectroscopic quasars ( with @xmath66 ) in order to quantify certain selection effects . including fainter quasars",
    "is expected to change the above numbers by a modest amount as the slope of quasar number counts distribution is a slowly varying function of magnitude ( see @xcite ) .",
    "redshift - dependent selection effects are not considered here . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the sdss quasar selection algorithm is less efficient in detecting reddened quasars at @xmath70 .",
    "this effect can be neglected in the present analysis as only a small fraction of objects are found at such a redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ plot_absorber_distribs ] ) .                in order to investigate the effects of reddening and magnification due to intervening absorbers",
    ", we use the sample of  systems compiled with the method presented in @xcite and based on sdss dr4 data . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the main steps involved in the absorption line detection procedure .",
    "for more details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "all quasar spectra from the sdss dr4 database were analyzed , regardless of qso magnitude .",
    "the continuum - normalized sdss qso spectra were searched for  @xmath71 doublets using an optimal extraction method employing a gaussian line - profile to measure each rest equivalent width @xmath2 .",
    "all candidates were interactively checked for false detections , a satisfactory continuum fit , blends with absorption lines from other systems , and special cases .",
    "the identification of mg ii doublets required the detection of the 2796 line and at least one additional line , the most convenient being the 2803 doublet partner .",
    "a 5@xmath16 significance level was required for all @xmath72 lines , as well as a @xmath73 significance level for the corresponding @xmath74 lines . only systems 0.1c blue - ward of the quasar redshift and red - ward of ly@xmath75 emission",
    "were accepted . for simplicity ,",
    "systems with separations of less than 500 km / s were considered as a single system .",
    "the line finder is able to detect mgii absorption lines with a rest equivalent width @xmath76   .",
    "however a high completeness is reached only in the range @xmath77   .",
    "we will therefore focus our analysis on these stronger systems only .",
    "in such a range , multiple absorbers detected in the same quasar spectrum are found only in @xmath78 of the systems .",
    "for such cases we consider only the stronger system .",
    "we note that  absorption lines are in general saturated and in these cases no column density information can be directly extracted from @xmath79 .",
    "the redshift distribution of the systems used in this analysis is presented in figure [ plot_absorber_distribs ] . the filled histogram shows that of the mgii systems and the solid line their background quasars .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ plot_absorber_distribs ] shows the _ observed _ distributions of absorber rest equivalent width @xmath2 . the intrinsic distribution , i.e. corrected for incompleteness is presented in @xcite .",
    "the right panel of the figure shows the distribution of rest equivalent width measurement uncertainty .",
    "it shows the existence of a correlation between line detectability and absorber rest equivalent width . as can be seen , the relative @xmath2 uncertainty becomes larger for weaker systems . because we require the 2796   absorption lines to be detected at least at the 5-sigma level , this results in a selection bias : weaker lines are preferentially found in high s / n spectra .",
    "in addition , given the fact that all sdss quasars are taken with a similar exposure time , the selection criteria introduce a correlation between quasar brightness and spectrum s / n .",
    "the line finder is therefore expected to preferentially find weaker systems in brighter quasars .",
    "a crucial step in our analysis will be to properly take this effect into account when we define a reference population of quasars without absorbers .      in order to test the efficiency of our detection technique and to identify biases and systematic effects we ran monte carlo simulations of the absorber catalog to create a sample of simulated mgii absorption lines reproducing the same properties as the real sample ( @xmath47 , @xmath2 , @xmath80 , etc . ) and same biases , but with the difference that the absorption lines are put in random spectra , i.e. that no correlation exists between quasar magnitude and absorber properties .",
    "such a population can then be used as a control sample .    in order to create this sample ,",
    "we proceed as follows : for each detected system , a simulated doublet having the same redshift , and similar @xmath81 , doublet ratio , and gaussian - fit width was put into many randomly selected edr spectra . each spectrum containing a simulated doublet",
    "was then run through the entire non - interactive and interactive pipelines , and @xmath47 and @xmath81 were measured for detected systems . over",
    "9100 simulated doublets were put in random quasar spectra .",
    "a large fraction of them appear in regions of spectra with insufficient signal to noise ratio to meet the detection threshold for the input @xmath81 .",
    "the line finder is then able to recover about 4400 systems .",
    "measurement error of the rest equivalent width @xmath81 can cause systems with @xmath82 to scatter into the output catalog as well as systems with @xmath83 to scatter out . therefore",
    ", the recovered distribution of rest equivalent width differs from the input one . in order to create a simulated absorption line sample with statistically identical distributions of rest equivalent widths ,",
    "a trial @xmath81 distribution was specified and then adjusted so that the simulated output best represents the data .",
    "we initially chose lines randomly from the input catalog according to a distribution of the form @xmath84 with an initial guess for @xmath85 , until the number of lines recovered were equal to that of the actual catalog .",
    "lines with input @xmath86    were used , although only lines with recovered @xmath17    were retained .",
    "we determined a maximum - likelihood value for @xmath87 using the recovered @xmath81 values .",
    "we then corrected our guess for @xmath85 to minimize @xmath88 .",
    "this procedure allows us to create a simulated absorption line sample having the same properties as the real sample described in the previous section .",
    "the distributions of real and simulated absorber redshifts , rest equivalent widths and rest equivalent widths uncertainties are presented in fig [ plot_absorber_distribs_fake ] . as can be seen",
    ", the statistical properties of the simulated samples match very well those of the real data .",
    "the figure shows that weaker absorption lines are preferentially found in high spectrum s / n  and therefore brighter quasars  in the same way as the real systems are .",
    "this bias is systematically introduced by the requirements of the line finder algorithm .",
    "below we show that the selection of reference quasars described in the previous section takes this effect into account .      as our goal is to isolate the magnitude shifts induced by intervening absorber systems , the selection of reference quasars must ( i ) not depend on quasar magnitudes and ( ii ) take into account the fact that the absorption line detectability depends on the spectrum s / n as seen above .    here",
    "we describe how we define such populations of quasars : we first select the quasars with detected absorbers above a given rest equivalent width @xmath89   .",
    "we will compare them to quasars without any detected absorber above this limit . in the goal of avoiding biases that would give rise to magnitude shifts ,",
    "a number of criteria must be applied : the two quasar populations must have the same redshift distribution and present the same absorption - line detectability .",
    "for a given absorber with rest equivalent width @xmath2 and redshift @xmath90 , we randomly look for a quasar without any detected absorber ( above @xmath91   ) such that : +",
    "( i ) they have similar redshifts , i.e. @xmath92@xmath93 ; + ( ii ) in addition , we need to check whether this quasar would have allowed for the detection of the absorption line , i.e.  if its s / n at the corresponding wavelengths is high enough .",
    "such a requirement translates into @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the minimum equivalent width that can be detected by the line finder at the corresponding wavelength .",
    "the quasars selected in this way are called _ reference _ quasars in the following .",
    "our selection procedure ensures that if similar absorbers population were present in front of the selected reference quasars , we would have been able to detect them .",
    "+ since the number of available quasars without detected absorbers is larger than the number of quasars with absorbers for the range of @xmath2 we are interested in , we repeat the previous step @xmath96 times in order to create a series of @xmath96 reference samples that will be used for estimating the noise associated to a single quasar sample .",
    "in order to isolate the magnitude changes due to the presence of the absorber systems we measure , in a given band @xmath26 , the mean magnitude difference between quasars with absorbers and reference quasars : @xmath97 as explained above , we can repeat the selection of reference quasars @xmath96 times and create a series of reference samples in a bootstrap manner .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the series samples can then be used in order to estimate the errors in the measured magnitude shifts . as an example",
    ", we show in figure [ plot_mag_histo ] the results obtained by using a sample of quasars with mgii absorbers having @xmath98    and their corresponding reference quasars .",
