    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is an important resource for quantum optics studies . in the process of spdc ,",
    "a pump ( _ p ) laser beam incident upon a nonlinear crystal creates a pair of entangled photons , usually called signal ( _ s ) and idler ( _ i ) @xcite .",
    "spdc was first proposed theoretically by klyshko in 1969 @xcite and demonstrated experimentally by burnham and weinberg in 1970 @xcite .",
    "idler and signal quantum interference in a beam - splitter was first demonstrated by hong , ou and mandel ( hom ) in 1987 @xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "signal and idler photons with the same frequency and polarization are combined in a 50/50 beam - splitter ( bs ) and the output photons are detected at the exit of the beam - splitter by coincidence detection . when the idler and the signal paths are made equal from the crystal to the bs",
    ", no coincidence counts are detected at the bs output .",
    "this null result is due to a destructive interference between the two indistinguishable paths that the pair can follow to produce coincidences : both photons are reflected at the bs or both photons are transmitted .",
    "since there is a @xmath0 phase shift for the photon reflection probability amplitude at the bs , the probability amplitudes for these two indistinguishable events cancel out and zero coincidence or a minimum , is measured @xcite .",
    "therefore , at this point the photon - pair goes to either exit ( photon coalescence @xcite ) . _ _ _    optical cavities have been used in spdc quantum optics experiments recently aiming the demonstration of the control of photon coalescence and anti - coalescence via a cavity and the production of time entangled photon - pairs .",
    "sagioro , olindo , monken and pdua @xcite , have demonstrated experimentally the interference of photons with the same polarization generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion in a hong - ou - mandel interferometer , after one of them passed through a symmetric cavity , i.e. a cavity whose mirrors have equal reflectivity . in the regime where the cavity length is larger than the one - photon coherence length ,",
    "photon coalescence and anti - coalescence interference is observed .",
    "it is shown that by changing the cavity length , coincidence peaks can be transformed in dips and vice - versa , even though the coherence length of the photon wavepacket is smaller than the cavity length . with a different goal , lu , campbell and ou @xcite , have generated mode - locked two - photon states by using a fabry - prot cavity for filtering the wide band light produced by spdc .",
    "the comb - like time correlation of the photon pairs is observed with a hom interferometer at the exit of the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "zavatta , viciani and bellini @xcite , have generated comb - like two - photon entangled states by inserting in one of the arms of a hom interferometer a fabry - perot cavity . in this manuscript , we analyze theoretically a modified version of the hong - ou - mandel interferometer .",
    "the optical paths along the arms of the interferometer contain two fabry - perot cavities , each one in an arm of the interferometer .",
    "these cavities allow the partial transmission and reflection of photons on each arm leading to a deviation of the number @xmath1 of coincidences from the standard hong - ou - mandel interferometer .",
    "the experimental apparatus , represented in fig .",
    "( [ hom2 ] ) , consists of an hom interferometer @xcite , and two symmetric cavities formed by two planar dielectric mirrors m5 and m6 ( m3 and m4 ) . a @xmath2 mm long @xmath3 crystal , oriented for type - i phase matching , is pumped by a cw laser oscillating at @xmath4 nm . a violet photon from the pump beam is down - converted into two conjugate infrared photons at @xmath5 nm ( signal and idler ) , so that energy and momentum are conserved during this process .",
    "both signal and idler photons are horizontally polarized and propagate at some angle @xmath6 from the pump beam direction .",
    "the apertures a1 , a2 select out the desired degenerate photon pairs .",
    "both beams are directed by the prisms p1 , p2 , and mirrors m1 , m2 into the two input ports of the @xmath7 beam splitter bs .",
    "each beam pass through symmetric fabry - perot cavities .",
    "both detectors d1 and d2 are avalanche photodiodes operating in photon counting mode and f1 , f2 are equal interference filters centered at @xmath5 nm . the prism p1 ( p2 ) is fixed over a translation stage displaceable by a step motor sm1 ( sm2 ) used to change the signal ( idler ) path length .",
    "the step motor sm3 ( sm4 ) is used for moving the mirror m5 ( m4 ) for changing the cavity length @xmath8 .",
    "we consider that the photon - pairs are generated not collinearly ( fig.[hom2 ] ) by spdc process with the crystal cut for type i phase - matching . in this case ,",
    "signal and idler photons are generated with the same linear polarization .",
    "suppose , we select the idler and signal photons with the same frequency and equal to half of the frequency of the laser pump beam ( degenerate case ) : @xmath9 .",
    "we also assume that the photon beams are selected by small diameter apertures ( see fig.[hom2 ] ) such that the propagation directions are well selected . in this case , the wavevector dispersion can be neglected and the momentum conservation in the spdc process considered perfect .",
    "we also consider that the pump laser beam is a coherent monochromatic beam , with no dispersion in frequency .",
    "the photons are then described by the state @xcite @xmath10 is centered in @xmath11 . in practice @xmath12",
    "is defined by interference filters in front the detectors ( see fig.[hom2 ] ) .",
    "the state @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) describes one photon of frequency @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the idler ( signal ) beam .",
    "the contribution from the vacuum cancels out in a photo - coincidence experiment as we have described above , so its contribution have been neglected in eq .",
    "( [ spdc1 ] ) .",
    "the state @xmath17 can also be cast in the form @xmath18 where the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 create photons of frequency @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the idler and signal modes , respectively .    after being generated ,",
    "the photons of each beam interact with a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the photons can be transmitted or reflected by the cavities .",
    "the action of these cavities is similar to a beam splitter @xcite , that is @xmath21 where the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) describe reflected and transmitted photons of the incoming idler ( signal ) beam with frequency @xmath15 .",

    "the second is the variation of the platform with the changing in the cavities lengths , this is due a new kind of interference that either did not happen in the one cavity case .",
    "finally we show that is possible to construct a xor gate using our apparatus .",
    "in fact , if you prefer , instead of using as outgoing bits , sy standing for bit 0 and ns for bit 1 ( see table [ xor ] last collum ) you can use the value of the platform ( see fig .",
    "[ dc , rr , rar , arar ] ) , all you have to do is to stop the delay in the platform , e.g. @xmath191 ps in that case , calibrate your system , and you are ready to use the platform value as outgoing bits , for example : the highest value can stand for bit 0 and the lowest one for bit 1 .",
