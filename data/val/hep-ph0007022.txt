    "since the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measured the first moment of the proton spin structure function @xmath6  @xcite , there has been a great deal of discussion about the spin content of the proton .",
    "a series of following experiments  @xcite confirmed the emc measurement .",
    "in contrast to the result from the naive nonrelativistic quark model , which is reflected in the ellis - jaffe sum rule  @xcite , the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin deviates from zero . the global fit performed by ellis and karliner",
    "@xcite gives the following value @xmath7 .",
    "for more recent analysis , see refs.@xcite .",
    "these results , however , are obtained with an assumption of the exact su(3 ) symmetry for the baryon semileptonic decays .",
    "great efforts have been already spent on understanding the spin and flavor content of the proton ( see for review @xcite and recent papers @xcite ) . while it is now known that a large fraction of the nucleon spin is provided by gluons and their orbital angular momenta ,",
    "it is still very important to understand the mechanism of how the quarks carry the nucleon spin . in particular , since the extraction of the flavor content of the nucleon spin relies on the empirical data of the baryon semileptonic decays , it is of great significance to examine the influence of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking on the axial properties of the baryons in a consistent way .",
    "one piece of information comes from the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath8 of the proton : @xmath9 the analysis of karliner and lipkin  @xcite implies @xmath10 which can be translated into : @xmath11 if @xmath12 is assumed .",
    "let us for completeness quote also the result for the neutron : @xmath13 where the isospin symmetry ( bjorken sum rule ) has been assumed .",
    "another piece of information comes from the semileptonic decays , which in the case of the exact su(3 ) symmetry can be parametrized by two reduced matrix elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 . taking for @xmath16 and for @xmath17 together with eq.([gampval ] ) , one gets for the proton : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which implies @xmath21 , quite a small number as compared with the naive expectation from the quark model : @xmath22 .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath23 is _ not directly measured _ ; it is extracted from the data through some theoretical model . the standard way to calculate",
    "@xmath23 is to assume the su(3 ) symmetry for the semileptonic decays . in this case",
    "it is enough to take _ any _ two decays and @xmath24 of eq.([gampval ] ) as an input . normally , as in the example above",
    ", one uses neutron beta decay and @xmath25 decay as an input .",
    "however , if the su(3 ) symmetry breaking was not important , any pair out of six known semileptonic decays should give roughly the same number for @xmath23 .",
    "this is , however , _ not _ the case . as we shall see in the next section",
    ", @xmath23 can be any number between 0.02 and 0.30 .",
    "these numbers do not take into account the experimental errors , therefore , as shown in figure 1 , the uncertainty of @xmath23 due to the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the semileptonic decays is even larger .",
    "this is the key observation which motivated this work .",
    "it is almost impossible to analyze the symmetry breaking in weak decays without resorting to some specific model  @xcite . in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will implement the symmetry breaking for the semileptonic decays using the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath26qsm for short )  @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for review ) which satisfactorily describes the axial - vector properties of the hyperons @xcite@xcite .",
    "since the symmetry breaking pattern of the @xmath26qsm is identical to the one derived in large @xmath27 qcd @xcite , our analysis is in fact much more general than the model itself .",
    "since @xmath28b@xmath29 does not correspond to the su(3 ) octet axial - vector current , it is an independent quantity in qcd and it can not be expressed in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 without some further assumptions . the @xmath26qsm ( as most of the hedgehog models  @xcite ) has a remarkable virtue of connecting the singlet axial - vector constant with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the semileptonic decay constants in a direct manner .",
    "this connection introduces a model dependence into our analysis .",
    "however , as we discussed in our previous paper on the proton spin structure @xcite and as will be shown in section v.a , there is no significant numerical difference between the results obtained with and without this model dependent ingredient . whether this remains true for other baryons",
    "can not be checked because of the lack of the data which could be additionally used if the model formula for @xmath28b@xmath29 is abandoned .    in section",
    "ii.e we give an additional theoretical argument in favor of the model prediction for @xmath28b@xmath29 .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown how the symmetry breaking influences the determination of @xmath23 from the existing data on the weak semileptonic baryon decays . here",
    "our analysis is extended to all other members of the octet using the same `` _ model - independent _ '' method where the dynamical quantities , which are in principle calculable within the model @xcite , are treated as free parameters . by adjusting them to the experimentally known semileptonic decays we allow not only for maximal phenomenological input but also for minimal model dependence . in refs.@xcite@xcite magnetic moments of the octet and decuplet",
    "have been studied in this way .",
    "model calculations for the vector - axial properties of baryons have been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "there exist also direct model calculations of the spin polarization function itself  @xcite .",
    "although the spin content of the hyperons will be most probably not directly measured ( with an exception of @xmath32 where spin structure function can be related to the measured fragmentation function @xcite ) , there is a substantial theoretical interest in the spin properties of the hyperons .",
    "we find that despite the fact that the symmetry breaking for the semileptonic decays themselves is not strong , other quantities like @xmath0 and @xmath1 are much more affected .",
    "we observe splitting of @xmath5 for different baryons .",
    "unfortunately our analysis suffers from large errors which are mainly due to the experimental errors of the @xmath3 decays .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to measure these two decays with higher precision .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we recall the su(3 ) symmetry results and discuss various ways of determining @xmath1 and separately @xmath2 s . in section iii , following ref.@xcite , we recall the main properties of the @xmath26qsm with special emphasis on the mass splittings , which we subsequently use in section iv to parametrize the su(3 ) breaking of the semileptonic weak decays . in section",
    "v numerical analysis is carried out and the conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "let us first briefly recall how the standard analysis is carried out .",
    "three diagonal axial - vector coupling constants define the integrated polarized quark densities for a given baryon b : @xmath33 note that in our normalization @xmath28b@xmath34 @xmath35 .    assuming the su(3 ) symmetry",
    ", one can calculate @xmath36b@xmath29 in terms of the reduced matrix elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 : is proportional to @xmath37(third component of the isospin which we assume to take the highest value ) ] @xmath38 at this stage @xmath39 is an independent quantity and it is identical for all octet states .",
    "these equations together with ( [ ga380 ] ) allow one to express @xmath40 s in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath41 :    @xmath42    the su(3 ) symmetry imposes certain relations between @xmath2 s of different flavor for different baryons : @xmath43 so that @xmath2 s given in eq.([d ] ) are the only independent ones in the su(3 ) symmetry limit .",
    "in addition we have the isospin relations @xmath44 which remain still valid after the inclusion of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .    in order to find the numerical values of @xmath2 s",
    "one considers different scenarios which we shortly discuss in the following .      in the naive quark model there",
    "exist two relations between the constants @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 : @xmath45 moreover , one assumes that the total spin is carried by the quarks , _ i.e. _ : @xmath46 with these parameters one gets @xmath47 .",
    "values for all @xmath2 s and @xmath24 are presented in table i. the prediction for @xmath24 is , however , very bad , about two times the experimental value .",
    "certainly these naive quark model values ( [ su3fd ] ) are not realistic .",
    "one can do better by extracting @xmath14 and @xmath15 from experiment . for example , assuming the exact su(3 ) symmetry , one has @xmath48 for convenience , we denote the ratios of axial - vector to vector decay constants by @xmath49 ( see table iii ) .",
    "taking for these decays the experimental values , one obtains @xmath50 as displayed in the column @xmath51 in table i.    one could , however , use any two @xmath49 s out of six known weak semileptonic decays to extract @xmath14 and @xmath52 the number of combinations is fourteen ( actually fifteen , but two conditions are linearly dependent ) . taking these fourteen combinations into account , one gets : @xmath53 these are the uncertainties of the _ central values _ due to the theoretical error caused by using the exact su(3 ) symmetry to describe the weak semileptonic decays .",
    "these uncertainties are further increased by the experimental errors of all individual decays .",
    "looking at eq.([fdrange ] ) , one might get an impression that a typical error associated with the use of the su(3 ) symmetry in analyzing the hyperon decays is of the order of 15 % or so . while this is true for the hyperon",
    "decays themselves , the values of @xmath54 and @xmath41 for various baryons might be much more affected by the symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , since @xmath55 in the su(3 ) symmetry limit we get @xmath56 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 corresponding to eq.([fdrange ] ) and @xmath57 as given by eq.([gampval ] ) .",
    "this large uncertainty of the central value of @xmath41 is _ entirely _ due to the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the hyperon decays . in fig.1",
    "we plot @xmath41 together with experimental errors for each pair of the semileptonic decays .    anticipating the results of section",
    "iv let us mention that there exist two linear combinations of @xmath49 s which are free of the linear @xmath58 corrections in the @xmath59qsm ( and large @xmath27 qcd @xcite ) , namely : @xmath60 which give numerically @xmath61 as displayed in table i in the column  average  .",
    "it is important to note that by adopting this way of extracting @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the symmetry limit , no refitting of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is required when @xmath62 corrections are added .    in",
    "what follows we shall use these two sets ",
    "eqs.([fdstand],[fdmsfree ] )  of values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 while discussing the predictions for @xmath2 s .",
    "in order to extract all @xmath2 s separately , one needs some additional information .",
    "either another experimental input is needed , or a model which predicts @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .      in 1974",
    "ellis and jaffe @xcite made an assumption , based on the naive quark model that @xmath65 from our su(3 ) formula ( [ d ] ) , we see that this amounts to @xmath66 which indeed gives 1 for the naive quark model values ( [ su3fd ] ) .",
    "for the experimental values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 discussed in the previous section we get @xmath41 around 0.6 as displayed in table i. unfortunately , the value of @xmath67 is much larger than the experimental value .      instead of using the low energy data alone , one can also use the high energy data on the first moment of the polarized structure function of the proton ( [ ip0 ] ) with @xmath68 .",
    "the results of such fits for two choices of @xmath14 and @xmath15 constants are presented in columns 5 and 6 of table i. a striking feature of these fits is that the resulting @xmath41 is very small .",
    "this fact is often referred to as a _ spin crisis .",
    "_      as will be shown in the following , the @xmath59qsm predicts in the su(3 ) symmetry limit  @xcite : @xmath69 for all octet baryons .",
    "this formula has a remarkable feature : it interpolates between the naive quark model and the skyrme model .",
    "indeed , for ( [ su3fd ] ) @xmath70 , whereas in the case of the simplest skyrme model for which @xmath71 , @xmath72 , as observed for the first time in ref.@xcite .",
    "here @xmath41 is very sensitive to small variations of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , since it is a difference of the two , with relatively large coefficients .",
    "indeed , for the 14 fits mentioned before eq.([fdrange ] ) the central value for @xmath41 varies between @xmath73 to approximately 1 . thus , despite the fact that the hyperon semileptonic decays are relatively well described by the model in the su(3 ) symmetry limit , the singlet axial - vector constant is basically undetermined .",
    "this is a clear signal of the importance of the symmetry breaking for this quantity .",
    "in fact , conclusions similar to ours have been obtained in chiral perturbation theory in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we shall briefly recall how the model parameters are fixed .",
    "because of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking due to the strange quark mass @xmath75 the collective baryon hamiltonian is no longer su(3)-symmetric .",
    "indeed @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 here @xmath79 denotes baryon spin , @xmath80su(3)@xmath29 the casimir operator and @xmath81 are the su(3 ) wigner matrices in representation @xmath82 .",
    "constants @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are given by ref.@xcite : @xmath86 here @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the `` moments of inertia '' and @xmath89 is related to the nucleon sigma term : @xmath90 , @xmath91 being the average mass of the up and down quarks .",
    "the collective splitting hamiltonian ( [ hprim ] ) mixes the states in various su(3 ) representations .",
    "the octet states are mixed with the higher representations such as antidecuplet @xmath92 and eikosiheptaplet @xmath93 . in the linear order in @xmath75 the wave function of a state @xmath94 of spin @xmath95",
    "is given as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "mixing parameters @xmath98 can be found for example in ref .",
    "they are given as products of @xmath75 ( which we assume to be 180  mev ) times a known numerical constant @xmath99 depending on the baryonic state @xmath100 and a dynamical parameter @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath101 depends on the model parameter @xmath102 , which is responsible for the splitting between the octet and higher exotic multiplets   @xcite and is not constrained from the data we will take them as free parameters in our fits .",
    "the transition matrix elements of the hadronic axial - vector current @xmath103 can be expressed in terms of three independent form factors : @xmath104 u_{b_1 } ( p_1),\\ ] ] where the axial - vector current is defined as @xmath105 with @xmath106 for strangeness conserving @xmath107 currents and @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath110 stands for the square of the momentum transfer @xmath111 .",
    "the form factors @xmath112 are real quantities depending only on the square of the momentum transfer in the case of @xmath113-invariant processes",
    ". we can safely neglect @xmath114 for the reason that on account of @xmath115 its contribution to the decay rate is proportional to the ratio @xmath116 , where @xmath117 represents the mass of the lepton ( @xmath118 or @xmath119 ) in the final state and @xmath120 that of the baryon in the initial state .",
    "similarly we shall neglect @xmath121 . in principle",
    "this form factor is proportional to @xmath62 and therefore should be included in the consistent analysis of the weak decays data .",
    "unfortunately , such an analysis is still missing and all experimental results on @xmath122 assume @xmath123 .",
    "another possible small @xmath62 corrections come from the evolution of @xmath122 with @xmath124 , due to the non - conservation of the axial - vector currents caused by the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "these corrections are also neglected in our approach .",
    "it is already well known how to treat hadronic matrix elements such as @xmath125 in the @xmath126qsm ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "taking into account the @xmath127 rotational and @xmath75 corrections , we can write the resulting axial - vector constants @xmath128 in the following form : @xmath129 ,   \\label{eq : g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 denote parameters depending on the specific dynamics of the chiral soliton model . their explicit form in the @xmath59qsm can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "analogously to eq.([eq : g1 ] ) one defines the diagonal axial - vector couplings . in that case",
    "@xmath131 can take two values : @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "for @xmath134 ( singlet axial - vector current ) we have the following expression @xcite : @xmath135    a remark concerning constants @xmath136 is here in order .",
    "coefficient @xmath137 contains the terms which are leading and subleading in the @xmath138 expansion .",
    "the presence of the subleading terms enhances the numerical value of @xmath137 calculated in the @xmath26qsm for the self - consistent profile and makes the model predictions remarkably close to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this feature , although very important for the model phenomenology , does not concern us here , since our procedure is based on fitting all coefficients @xmath139 from the data .",
    "constants @xmath140 and @xmath141 are both subleading in @xmath142 and come from the anomalous part of the effective euclidean action . in the skyrme model",
    "they are related to the wess - zumino term .",
    "however in the simplest version of the skyrme model ( which is based on the pseudo - scalar mesons only ) @xmath143 identically @xcite . in the case of the @xmath26qsm @xmath144",
    "and it provides a link between the su(3 ) octet of axial - vector currents and the singlet current of eq.([eq : singlet ] ) .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that in the limit of the artificially large soliton , which corresponds to the `` skyrme limit '' of the present model , @xmath145 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , for the small solitons @xmath146 reproducing the result of the non - relativistic quark model .    instead of calculating 7 dynamical parameters @xmath130 and @xmath102 ( or @xmath147 and @xmath148 ) within the @xmath59qsm ( which was done in ref.@xcite , we shall fit them from the weak semileptonic decay data .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following set of new parameters : @xmath149 @xmath150    employing this new set of parameters , we immediately express all possible semileptonic decay constants between the octet baryons : @xmath151 the u(3 ) axial - vector constants @xmath152 can be also expressed in terms of the new set of parameters eq.([eq : newp ] ) . for the triplet ones s",
    "are proportional to @xmath37 , formulae in eq.([eq : triplet ] ) correspond to the highest isospin state ] we have : @xmath153 and for the octet ones , we get : @xmath154    as already explained in the introduction the model provides a link between the octet currents and the singlet axial current . for the singlet axial - vector constants , we have : @xmath155    let us note that by redefinition of @xmath156 and @xmath157 we can get rid of the variable @xmath158 : @xmath159    in the chiral limit parameters @xmath157 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath158 and @xmath156 vanish and we recover the su(3 ) symmetric relations from section ii with @xmath162 from which eq.([ga0 ] ) follows .",
    "we fix the newly - defined set of parameters from the experimental data of semileptonic decays .",
    "their numerical values are given in table iii .",
    "we do not quote the experimental errors on these parameters , since they are highly correlated and can not be used directly to calculate the errors of the physical quantities of interest .",
    "instead , we expressed all observables directly in terms of the @xmath49 s .",
    "this is , however , not enough since , as in the chiral limit , the extra input is needed .    at this point",
    "a necessity of a complete description of the symmetry breaking is clearly seen .",
    "the strange quark mass causes all su(3 ) symmetry relations ( [ eq : su3 ] ) to break .",
    "so in principle one needs one extra experimental input for each isospin multiplet .",
    "let us first discuss the case of the nucleon first .",
    "we shall repeat here the analysis of section ii , however , with the symmetry breaking taken into account . again",
    "four different choices for an additional input will be considered : 1 ) @xmath22 , 2 ) @xmath163 , 3 ) @xmath68 and 4 ) the @xmath59qsm formulae ( [ eq : sing ] ) for @xmath164 .",
    "the results are summarized in table ii .",
    "it can be immediately seen that the first two possibilities are in contradiction with experimental data on @xmath24 and @xmath165 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use the experimental value of @xmath166 as an additional input ( but no model formula ( [ eq : sing ] ) for @xmath164 ) , or alternatively the @xmath26qsm prediction for @xmath164 , the results are almost indistinguishable .",
    "this gives a numerical support for the correctness of the @xmath26qsm formula for the axial - vector singlet current with the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "of course the results of table ii have to be taken with a bit of care because of large experimental errors which are not displayed . as we have argued in ref.@xcite",
    ", one could still accommodate @xmath47 due to the large errors of @xmath167 decays .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the following .",
    "it the present section we shall present the numerical results of our analysis based on the chiral quark soliton model with the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "our strategy is very simple : using model parametrization ( [ eq : semilep ] ) we expressed @xmath2 s and @xmath41 s in terms of the six known weak semileptonic decays .",
    "errors are added in quadrature .",
    "the numerical results are summarized in table iv and in figures 2  9 . to guide an eye",
    "it is convenient to restore the linear @xmath168 dependence for the quark densities in the following way : @xmath169 and similarly for @xmath41 .",
    "this is possible because our chiral parameters @xmath170 and @xmath171 do not need to be refitted as the symmetry breaking corrections are included . in order to display the errors",
    "which come from the experimental errors of the weak decays , at both ends of each figure we also plot the theoretical predictions as black dots together with the error bars .",
    "let us first comment on the results on @xmath24 and @xmath165 .",
    "we see from table iii that the experimental values are quite well reproduced by the model , provided the @xmath58 corrections are included . in the symmetry",
    "limit their values are way off from the experimental data .",
    "next , let us observe that the singlet axial - vector current couplings @xmath172 split when the symmetry breaking is switched on .",
    "this is due to the term proportional to @xmath173 in eq.([eq : singlet ] ) .",
    "this splitting is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "we see that @xmath23 shows the weakest @xmath58 dependence , whereas @xmath174 and @xmath175 depend quite strongly on @xmath58 .",
    "large error bars for these quantities are due almost entirely to the large errors of @xmath167 decays @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "it is however evident from fig .",
    "2 that @xmath178 and @xmath167 are much closer to the nonrelativistic limit than p and @xmath179 .    in figs.3",
    " 6 we plot @xmath2 for the nucleon , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 respectively .",
    "we see that in all 4 cases @xmath0 rises relatively strongly with @xmath58 .",
    "it is therefore not justified to extract the strange quark polarization assuming the exact su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath181 s have also the largest error coming , as in the case of @xmath182 , almost entirely from the errors of @xmath167 decays .    in figs.79",
    "we examine the breaking of the su(3 ) relations given by eqs.([eq : su3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly we find that there is an approximate equality between @xmath183 and @xmath184 for all values of @xmath58 .",
    "in the analysis of the polarized structure function @xmath122 of the proton and neutron one has to take an additional input from the low energy hyperon decays .",
    "customarily the su(3 ) symmetry for these decays is assumed .",
    "however , if one takes all possible combinations of the low energy decays the resulting @xmath5 can take any value between 0.02 and 0.30 . as depicted in fig.1",
    "this range is further increased if the errors coming from the experimental error bars of the semileptonic decays are properly included .",
    "this observation implies that the su(3 ) symmetry breaking plays an essential role in extracting @xmath5 from the experimental data .",
    "it was therefore the aim of this paper to study the influence of the symmetry breaking on the determination of @xmath5 and @xmath0 for the octet baryons in a consistent way .",
    "for this purpose we have performed the `` _ model - independent _ '' analysis based on the algebraic structure of the chiral quark soliton model . in this approach , one makes merely use of the algebraical structure of the model , treating the dynamical quantities which are in principle calculable in the model as free parameters .",
    "model predictions of the axial - vector properties of the octet baryons have been already calculated elswhere  @xcite .",
    "there are two model ingredients which are of importance .",
    "the first one is the model formula for the octet axial - vector currents which have been derived in the linear order in @xmath62 and @xmath185 .",
    "our formulae here have the same algebraical structure as in the large @xmath27 qcd @xcite , and therefore they are more general than the model itself . secondly , unlike in qcd , the model provides a link between the octet axial - vector currents and the singlet axial - vector current .",
    "this connection is a truly model - dependent ingredient , however , we have given the arguments in favor of eq.([eq : singlet ] ) , based on the fact that apart from the general success of the @xmath26qsm in reproducing form factors and parton distributions , in the limit of the small soliton it properly reduces to the nonrelativistic quark model prediction , and in the limit of the large soliton it reproduces the skyrme model prediction for @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , in ref.@xcite the argument has been given that eq.([ga0 ] ) naturally emerges in the limit of the large @xmath62 , where the su(3 ) flavor symmetry reduces to the su(2 ) one .",
    "the numerical analysis of section v.a provides a further support for the model formula for @xmath5 .",
    "we have presented two parametrizations of all available semileptonic decays .",
    "the first one is obtained assuming the su(3 ) symmetry , however the two reduced matrix elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 were extracted from the combinations of the semileptonic decays which are free of the @xmath62 corrections ( [ dfexp ] ) , rather than from the neutron and @xmath25 decays alone .",
    "the second one is obtained by fitting all 6 measured semileptonic decays in terms of 6 free parameters defined in eqs.([eq : newp],[eq : semilep ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two fits , as seen from table iii , is rather small , except perhaps for the @xmath186 decay . despite the fact that the symmetry breaking for the semileptonic decays themselves is not strong , other quantities like @xmath0 and @xmath1 are much more affected by taking into account the effects of the non - zero strange quark mass",
    "this is clearly shown in figs.29 .    whether this sensitivity is a sign of the breakdown of the perturbative approach to the strangenes , as it was recently suggested in ref.@xcite , is hard to say , since our anaysis suffers from large errors which are mainly due to the experimental errors of the @xmath3 decays .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to measure these two decays with the precision comparable to the other four decays .",
    "one should bare in mind that this is one of a few cases , where the low energy data have an important impact on our understanding of the high energy scattering .",
    "given the theoretical implications of these experiments as far as the role of the axial anomaly and the gloun polarization is concerned @xcite , one should make it clear how important the new measurements of the @xmath3 decays would be .",
    "this is perhaps the most important message of our analysis .",
