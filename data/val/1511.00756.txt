    "+ the aim of this paper is to show existence of no classical riemann solutions to a physical model with important applications in modern industry .",
    "it has been already shown in carefully designed experiments by mazzotti et al .",
    "@xcite , that this model exhibits singular shocks .",
    "singular shocks , a type of weak solutions of very low regularity have been studied before .",
    "there were originally discovered by keyfitz and kranzer @xcite , and later studied in greater depth by sever @xcite .",
    "keyfitz and kranzer @xcite worked with a strictly hyperbolic , genuinely nonlinear system derived from a @xmath0-dimensional model for isothermal , isentropic gas dynamics and they observed that there is a large region , where the riemann problem can not be solved using shocks and rarefactions .",
    "they produced approximate unbounded solutions which do not satisfy the equation in the classical weak - solution sense and showed that only the first component of the rankine - hugoniot relation is satisfied , giving a unique speed @xmath1 for which any given two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be joined .",
    "later on , schecter @xcite proved existence of a viscous solution following dafermos s approach @xcite , under the condition that the singular shock is overcompressive .",
    "schecter used a geometric method and dynamical systems theory ( blowing - up approach to geometric singular perturbation problems that lack normal hyperbolicity , see fenichel @xcite and jones @xcite ) .",
    "keyfitz and tsikkou @xcite , showed existence of approximations to singular shock solutions by the same method , for a non hyperbolic system ( change of type ) derived from isentropic gas dynamics for an ideal fluid with @xmath4 conserving velocity and entropy .",
    "singular shocks also appear in a two - fluid model for incompressible two - phase flow , see keyfitz et al .",
    "@xcite , in a model describing gravity - driven , particle - laden thin - film flow , see wang and bertozzi @xcite , mavromoustaki and bertozzi @xcite , in the brio system appearing in the study of plasma and the classical shallow - water system see kalisch and mitrovic @xcite and possibly in a model for chemotaxis , see levine and sleeman @xcite .",
    "naturally , questions then arise about whether it is possible to predict singular shock solutions to systems , find a physical interpretation of their significance , explain the sense in which they satisfy the equation and find a better definition which will describe some wider collection of examples , check for connection between singular shocks , genuinely nonlinear systems and change of type .",
    "a few of these questions will be subject of future work .",
    "investigation of singular solutions was mostly focused on the case when only one state variable develops the dirac delta function and the others are functions with a bounded variation .",
    "we have though other physically important systems with delta functions in more than one state variables .",
    "for example , mazzotti @xcite in his recent work , showed numerically and experimentally that the following model , in a single space dimension and time , arising in two - component chromatography ( concentration @xmath5 for chemical i ) @xmath6 exhibits singular solutions .",
    "he obtained approximate solutions , using a linear combination of @xmath7-functions , with an error that converged to zero and showed that neither of the rankine - hugoniot equations is satisfied . in system ( [ chromatography ] ) that results when some assumptions in the traditional langmuir equilibrium model are changed , the conserved quantities are the masses of two components flowing at constant speed along a column , cooperating for adsorption sites and is a system which exhibits change of type ( hyperbolic and elliptic ) .    in this paper , we obtain useful information from the dafermos - diperna self - similar regularization and produce an explanation / description of the singular solution in mazzotti s work .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive a simpler system of equations which we will study , by rescaling time and changing the dependent variables .",
    "these changes are linear in the conserved quantities so that the form of the system is maintained .",
    "derivation of alternative models will be also subject of future work . in section 3",
    "we give a formal description of the riemann solutions , including the cases that include vacuum states .",
    "as in keyfitz et al .",
    "@xcite , we are led to the form of the solutions by using a self - similar viscous perturbation of the system .",
    "the new system has now similar properties to those in @xcite , as only the first component of the rankine - hugoniot relation is satisfied . in section 4 ,",
    "we use the theory of dynamical systems in the same spirit as in schecter @xcite , keyfitz and tsikkou @xcite and more specifically geometric singular perturbation theory ( gspt ) , see fenichel @xcite , jones @xcite , krupa and szmolyan @xcite , jones and kopell @xcite , schecter and szmolyan @xcite , to construct orbits that connect the left and right states given by @xmath8 we also prove existence of self - similar viscous profiles for overcompressive singular shocks for the chromatography model . it should be noted , however , that the symmetry in the orbits is lost and the solutions differ significantly from those of previous models exhibiting singular shocks .    there is a body of literature on all kinds of chromatography systems of the form @xmath9 but all the known results are for simplified , everywhere hyperbolic , systems which also belong to temple class . for recent developments in this direction",
    "see shen @xcite , li and shen @xcite and sun @xcite for a system with @xmath10 ( the second characteristic family is linearly degenerate ) ; guo , pan and yin @xcite , cheng and yang @xcite for a system with @xmath11 ( the first characteristic family is linearly degenerate ) ; wang @xcite for a system with @xmath12 ( the first characteristic family is linearly degenerate ) , and the references cited therein .",
    "see also shelkovich @xcite for a class of systems with a different definition of solutions whose components contain dirac delta functions .",
    "these include the system of nonlinear chromatography for @xmath13 and @xmath14 is henry s constant .",
    "+ in this section we derive a simpler system of equations from ( [ chromatography ] ) which we study in this paper . since these changes are linear in the conserved quantities we are not changing the form of the system .",
    "we also analyze its basic properties ( hyperbolicity , genuine nonlinearity , and the shock and rarefaction curves sketched in figure [ figure2.1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we identify the regions where classical riemann solutions exist .       + we start out with the equations in the form used by mazzotti @xcite , @xmath15 with @xmath16 to create a system more conventional to conservation laws researchers , we make some changes of variables .",
    "first , we change to a moving coordinate system , or rescale time : @xmath17 so that the system becomes @xmath18 we then drop the prime in @xmath19 the aim is to focus on the conserved quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 so we also change the dependent variables . if we let @xmath22 then we have @xmath23 looking then at ( [ 2.1.3 ] ) , we let @xmath24,\\ ] ] and we find @xmath25 in the original variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 the new variables can be expressed as @xmath28 this system , equivalent to ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) for smooth solutions , but possessing different weak solutions , expresses conservation of @xmath29 and @xmath30 we define @xmath31 and @xmath32 the flux function .",
    "we work with the system ( [ 2.1.4 ] ) and riemann data @xmath33 to show existence of singular shocks .",
    "attention is drawn to the limit @xmath34 where the variables @xmath35 @xmath27 of ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) become singular .",
