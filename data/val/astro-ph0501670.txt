    "supernova sn 2003dh was discovered in the spectra of the optical transient ( ot ) of the nearby gamma - ray burst grb 030329 ( @xmath9 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , providing a strong confirmation that long grbs originate from core collapse of very massive stars ( e.g. , the `` collapsar '' model ; @xcite ) .",
    "previous clear evidence of the grb - sn connection , although not as direct , was the temporal and spatial coincidence between sn 1998bw and another nearby grb 980425 ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "sn 1998bw displayed unusually broad spectral features that require a high explosion energy to explain , more than 10 times that of an ordinary sn @xcite , and because of this it was termed a hypernova @xcite .",
    "the spectral features of grb 030329/sn 2003dh have also been shown to be hypernova - like @xcite .",
    "various efforts have been made to separate the sn light from the underlying optical afterglow ( oa ) of grb 030329 , yielding different results ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that the brightness of the oa thoroughly eclipsed that of the sn for the first week and kept competing with it for at least 1 month .",
    "this is unlike the case of grb 980425/sn 1998bw , in which an oa was not detected .",
    "the problem is further compounded by the contribution of the host galaxy to any spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used a least - squares fit to decompose their observed spectra of the first month .",
    "they adopted the spectra of sn 1998bw and other hypernovae as templates and assumed an oa template using either an early spectrum or a power - law continuum .",
    "the similarities of the first - month spectra to those of sn 1998bw were revealed .",
    "however , the assumption implied in this method , that each spectrum of sn 2003dh is identical to one or the other of the known hypernovae , can not be guaranteed a priori .",
    "@xcite found that the light curve ( lc ) of sn 2003dh also follows that of sn 1998bw ( but is fainter by @xmath11 mag ) , comparing their derived @xmath12-band light curve ( lc ) to the @xmath13-band lc of sn 1998bw without calculating real @xmath14-corrections .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , obtained a @xmath13-band lc with a peak @xmath15 days earlier , slightly brighter at maximum , and declining @xmath16 times faster after maximum than sn 1998bw .",
    "@xcite subtracted a host galaxy template from their @xmath17day 40 and @xmath17day 80 spectra , assuming a negligible oa contribution as extrapolated from @xcite .",
    "their sn spectra in the red part seem more similar to another hypernova , sn 1997ef @xcite than to sn 1998bw ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they found that the decline rate of sn brightness between these two epochs is similar to that of sn 1998bw .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived the sn lc directly from the ot photometry , without resorting to spectra .",
    "@xcite assumed a sn 1998bw - like lc shape and suggested that sn 2003dh is 1.5 times brighter than sn 1998bw , after correcting for an assumed host galaxy extinction of @xmath18 mag .",
    "however , their photometry was limited to the first 23 days , and was well sampled only until day 12 , when the sn component was still weak relative to the oa , and hence was unable to constrain the sn lc well .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , analyzed a dense @xmath19 data set of the ot photometry extending to day 80 .",
    "they constructed lcs for sn 2003dh by time - stretching those of sn 1998bw by a factor of 0.8 and lowering the brightness by 0.3 mag .",
    "they implicitly assumed that the color evolution also follows that of sn 1998bw , time - stretched by the same factor .    to address this problem with the view of theoretical modeling , @xcite pointed out that a reasonable spectrum of a type ic sn or hypernovae must show a flux deficiency to the blue of @xmath20  , like sne ia , owing to strong blanketing effects of dense metal lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they attributed the blue flux of the ot spectrum to the oa and used this to pivot the subtraction to obtain the sn spectrum .",
    "however , only three spectra at typical epochs were processed and modelled in that paper .",
    "the three bolometric points so derived were nonetheless shown to be consistent with a synthetic lc based on spectral models , which peaks @xmath15 days earlier , has a maximum brightness @xmath21 mag fainter , and at around 1 month is fainter by @xmath22 mag than sn 1998bw .",
    "it is important that the spectra and lcs of sn 2003dh are correctly derived , specifying the similarities and differences to sn 1998bw and to other type ic sne and hypernovae , whether grb - related or not .",
    "recently , another nearby grb - sn association was discovered , i.e. , grb 031203/sn 2003lw ( @xmath23 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , sn 2003lw was also claimed to be similar to sn 1998bw , although the observations were dominated by the light from the host galaxy , and the sn suffered from serious extinction .",
    "other observers emphasized the differences with respect to sn 1998bw @xcite .",
    "other cases of possible sne in grbs have been reported , virtually all of them based on the detection of a sn 1998bw - like `` bump '' in the ot lc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , grb 031211/sn 2002lt may be an exception ( @xmath24 ; @xcite ) , since it has been suggested that it resembles the ordinary type ic sn 1994i ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the weak version of hypernovae , sn 2002ap ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , for studies on the late evolution of the oa of grb 030329 , it is also crucial to consider how the oa and sn components are separated , as shown by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we update the spectra and lcs of sn 2003dh by applying the decomposition method of @xcite on all the observed spectra available to us .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , who for simplicity removed as much blue flux as possible from the ot spectra , we also refer to the blue part of sn 1998bw spectra that begins to show the flux deficiency to determine the amount of oa subtraction .",
    "the bolometric lcs resulting from the two approaches are compared to one another and to model lcs .",
    "we studied 14 observed spectra published by @xcite , those taken with the mmt , magellan , and keck telescopes , spanning from april 1 to may 24 ( see also @xcite ) , and the may 8/9 and june 22 spectra taken with the subaru telescope @xcite . the @xmath25- , @xmath13- , and @xmath12-band magnitudes that we derived from each @xcite spectrum , except that of may 24 , are consistent to within @xmath26 mag with the photometry of @xcite and with that reported in gcns .",
    "the differences in colors are smaller , i.e. , @xmath27 mag .",
    "the may 24 spectrum was of rather poor quality and was taken during the `` jitter episode '' when the ot varied rapidly by @xmath28 mag on a timescale of a few days @xcite .",
    "it was fainter by @xmath29 mag in the @xmath12-band than the above photometry , which had an almost daily coverage of the jitter episode .",
    "we re - calibrated its flux using @xmath30 from the photometry . to compensate for similar flux discrepancies ,",
    "the may and june subaru spectra were calibrated to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all the spectra were converted to the rest frame of the grb / sn ( @xmath9 ) , adopting a distance modulus of 39.54 .",
    "we adopted the spectrum of ngc 3125 , which was found by @xcite to show good coincidence to the observed narrow - line ratios , as the host galaxy template , and calibrated its flux to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this host galaxy template was subtracted from the observations , whose flux contribution steadily increases from @xmath34% in the first 20 days to @xmath35 around 60 days ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , to derive the ot spectra .",
    "this operation , however , did not fully eliminate the narrow emissions , so the residuals , artifacts , and telluric lines were removed by hand .",
    "we used each of the april 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ot spectra as the oa template .",
    "the april 1 , 2 , and 3 spectra , after sufficient smoothing , can be well fitted using a power law @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the april 4 spectrum , however , shows significant deviations from a power - law , which are not like sn features ( see below ) .",
    "these fitting power - laws and the smoothed april 4 spectrum were used in our actual spectrum subtraction .",
    "as stated above , we scaled the oa template in flux and subtracted it from the ot spectrum to obtain the sn component , taking into account the fact that strong line blanketing should have greatly depressed the sn flux to the blue of @xmath40  .",
    "line blanketing ( or blocking ) describes the significant strengthening of uv/@xmath0 continuum opacity caused by absorptions of numerous overlapping metal lines , mostly of fe - group elements and si , in a metal - rich , fast - moving sn atmosphere such as that of a sn ia ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or of a sn ic ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or of a hypernova ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we derived a quantitative criterion for the spectrum subtraction from the spectra of sn 1998bw @xcite , which have good @xmath0-band coverage . in the sn 1998bw spectra",
    ", the flux drops rapidly from @xmath41 to @xmath40  , along the h&k line profile , to reach the flux - deficiency range .",
    "the flux ratio of two reference wavelengths , @xmath42 , evolves from @xmath43 in the first 15 days to @xmath44 between 15 and 40 days , and to @xmath45 in the rest of the photospheric epoch .",
    "we imposed these values on the derived sn 2003dh spectra ( case i ) . on the other hand",
    ", we also tried the simple treatment of @xcite , forcing the minimal sn spectral flux in the @xmath0-band to zero ( case ii ) . since the ot spectra were noisy , in order to apply these criteria , we smoothed them before subtraction by averaging every 100 or 75 wavelengths points .    to determine the oa flux for epochs of the subaru spectra that have insufficient blue coverage , we fitted the oa flux evolution derived from decomposing the earlier spectra with a power law @xmath46 .",
    "the best - fit power - law index is about @xmath47 for case i and about @xmath48 for case ii .",
    "we show in figure [ fig2 ] the spectra of sn 2003dh between april 6 and june 22 that we derived from the smoothed ot spectra in case i by subtracting the april 3 oa template , except for april 7 . using",
    "the different oa templates mentioned above did not change the overall spectral appearance in most cases and affects the continuum shape , and hence the multiband photometry , only slightly .",
    "however , for april 7 , if any of the above oa templates were used , the derived spectrum turned out to be too blue to look like one of any type ic sn or hypernova .",
    "we assumed an oa spectrum of @xmath49 to get the `` reasonable '' april 7 sn spectrum shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the above problem of the april 7 spectrum was likely caused by observational uncertainties , because the difference between @xmath50 of this oa spectrum and that of the april 3 spectrum , i.e. , @xmath51 , is the same as that between the observed april 7 spectrum and the @xcite photometry .",
    "the resulting sn spectra in case ii are similar to those of case i , but they are fainter and redder since more oa flux was subtracted especially in the @xmath52 bands . to exemplify the difference between these two cases , in figure [ fig3 ] we compare the derived april 8 sn spectra with the sn 1998bw spectrum at a similar epoch . the sn spectrum in case i matches both the red and blue parts of the sn 1998bw spectrum well , while that in case ii shows a significant blue excess relative to the latter .",
    "the difference becomes small for the spectra of may and later , when the oa has greatly faded and contributes about 10%  15% of the total flux or less ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the april sn spectra resemble those of sn 1998bw at similar epochs , as discovered by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite pointed out that the red part of the may and june subaru spectra resembles the sn 1997ef spectra , where the @xmath53 and ir triplet lines are well separated , more than they do the sn 1998bw spectra , where these two lines still strongly blend at such epochs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to be confirmed by the may 24 spectrum of @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , where we compare the derived sn spectrum with those of sn 1997ef and sn 1998bw at similar epochs .",
    "although the spectrum is noisy , it seems to show separate @xmath54 and ir triplet lines , similar to sn 1997ef and unlike sn 1998bw ( see figure [ fig2 ] for a smoothed spectrum ) , if the red end has not been much polluted by the second - order spectrum .",
    "we can not find convincing sn features in the derived spectra on april 4 and 5 , which are also shown in figure [ fig2 ] for comparison .",
    "( the april 4 spectrum shown was obtained using the april 2 oa template ) first of all , they only contribute a few percent to the total flux , which is within the flux calibration error in the observations ( k. z. stanek & t. matheson 2004 , private communication ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the derived april 4 spectrum is continuum - like , similar to the derived april 3 spectrum in @xcite , while the hypernova sn 2002ap at @xmath55 days already displays clear , broad line features @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even if the dubious `` broad features '' in the derived april 5 spectrum are real , they do not match the sn features on april 6 and later , and hence are unlikely to be related to the sn .",
    "so we confirm that the april 3  5 ot `` color event '' @xcite , corresponding to the lc `` bump d '' of @xcite and close to the supposed jet break , is not of sn origin .",
    "we assembled the rest - frame @xmath56 multicolor lcs for sn 2003dh from broadband spectroscopy of the derived sn spectra , excluding april 7 ( see above ) , and corrected for the galactic reddening of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the lcs in both case i and ii are shown in figure [ fig5 ] and compared with those of sn 1998bw [ @xmath10 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ; @xcite ] .",
    "these are the results averaged over the cases of different oa templates .",
    "we list in table 1 the lc data in case i and their error bars , which vary between @xmath60 and @xmath61 mag .",
    "we estimated the error bars from statistical uncertainty ; flux calibration uncertainty of the observed spectra , i.e. , @xmath62 mag for the matheson spectra and @xmath63 mag for the subaru spectra ; and flux calibration uncertainty of the host galaxy , i.e. , @xmath64 mag .",
    "they are not shown in figure [ fig5 ] , for clarity .",
    "the derived sn  2003dh lcs are more similar to those of sn 1998bw than to those of any other known hypernova or type ic sn , but on the other hand , they are also narrower than those of sn 1998bw in both case i and ii .",
    "the case i lcs are as bright as sn 1998bw before maximum but fainter by about 0.3  0.6 mag after maximum .",
    "those in case ii are even fainter , particularly in the @xmath0 and @xmath25 bands .",
    "we think that case ii has underestimated the @xmath52 flux to some extent , by comparison with sn 1998bw and other hypernovae and type ic sne .",
    "case i seems therefore more realistic .",
    "our case i results are consistent with the apparent @xmath13-band lc derived by @xcite through decomposing the vlt spectra of the first month . their best - fit oa spectrum , @xmath65 , is not as steep as our templates , however . for comparison",
    ", we calculated the apparent @xmath13 magnitudes of our case i sn spectra converted to the observer frame . their magnitudes on rest - frame day 28 , 20 , and 8 are only fainter than ours by @xmath27 mag , while their day 10 is @xmath11 mag brighter .",
    "the differences are within our respective error bars .",
    "@xcite also showed a day 4 magnitude much brighter than sn 1998bw .",
    "however , the corresponding spectrum is not sn - like . as argued by @xcite and confirmed by us , sn features did not emerge until april 6 .",
    "it would be useful to apply the same treatment to the vlt spectra .",
    "for example , the lc around maximum could be defined much better using the vlt spectrum on rest - frame day 16 .",
    "the real sn lc inferred from the spectrum decomposition of @xcite may also be narrower than that of sn 1998bw , similar to our results , although it was stated by those authors that the two sne closely resemble each other .",
    "they were able to model the observed @xmath12-band lc by combining the derived oa @xmath66-band lc and a @xmath13-band lc of sn 1998bw , corrected for time dilation .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , they would have suggested a sn lc @xmath67 mag fainter than sn 1998bw if @xmath14-corrections had been taken into account .",
    "@xmath14-corrections for sn 1998bw have been calculated for various redshifts ( j. deng 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the one of interest here , @xmath68 , varies slightly between @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the first 100 days .",
    "the redshifted and @xmath14-corrected @xmath13-band lc of sn 1998bw exceeds the observed @xmath12-band brightness of the grb / sn at some epochs of the jitter episode ( @xmath17 day 50  70 ) , confirming the findings of @xcite . on the other hand , upon close inspection",
    ", the combined lc shown in figure 13 of @xcite seems to underestimate the observations at the early epochs , i.e. , before sn maximum .",
    "the sn lcs recommended by @xcite , i.e. , those of sn 1998bw stretched by 0.8 times and attenuated by 0.3 mag , are @xmath71 mag fainter , in the rest frame , than our case i results , depending on the individual epochs and the bands",
    ". our @xmath25- and @xmath0-band lcs also decline faster after day 30 than the lipkin lcs in both case i and case ii .",
    "only the @xmath13- and @xmath66-band lcs in case ii seem to match the lipkin ones .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath72 mag is the lower limit on their attenuation to meet the brightness minimum in the jitter episode .",
    "our results obviously also meet that requirement .",
    "we built the @xmath2 bolometric lcs for sn 2003dh using the above multicolor lcs in order to compare with theoretical models .",
    "however , we did not follow the common practice in which a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was constructed and integrated , because of the lack of the rest frame @xmath73-band lc and near - ir data . instead , we calculated the bolometric corrections ( bcs ) of sn 1998bw in each band and applied them to the sn 2003dh multicolor lcs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this is justified by the overall spectral similarity of these two sne .",
    "the @xmath12-band bc of sn 1997ef seems more suitable for may and june , because the spectra in this period are more similar in the red part to sn 1997ef than to 1998bw .",
    "we derived the @xmath12-band bc in such epochs from the sn 1997ef spectra @xcite but found that its value , @xmath74 , is similar to that of sn 1998bw , @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we ignored the difference between them .",
    "we averaged the bolometric lcs converted from the individual lc of each band to make up for the color difference between sn  2003dh and sn 1998bw .",
    "the average was taken over the @xmath25 and @xmath13 bands for most epochs , or over the @xmath25 , @xmath13 , and @xmath12 bands , if the last was available .",
    "we excluded the @xmath0-band to avoid potentially large uncertainties .",
    "the bolometric lc converted from the @xmath0-band lc is more or less consistent with the average one in case i , but that in case ii is @xmath76 mag fainter than the average one .",
    "in many cases , the @xmath0 band contributes to only a small fraction of the total flux of type ic sne , owing to line blanketing , so the bolometric lc may not be well correlated with the @xmath0-band lc .",
    "moreover , the bcs of sn 1998bw in the @xmath0 band may not be as reliable as in the other bands because of the common difficulties related to @xmath0-band photometry .",
    "in contrast , the bolometric lcs converted from the @xmath25- , @xmath13- , and @xmath12-band lcs agree with the average one within @xmath26 mag in both case i and case ii .",
    "we show our average bolometric lcs of both case i and case ii in figure [ fig6 ] ( _ top _ ) , where sn 2003dh is compared with the hypernovae sn 1998bw @xcite , sn 1997ef @xcite , and sn 2002ap @xcite and normal type ic sn 1994i ( b. p. schmidt & r. p. kirshner 1993 , private communication ; @xcite ) .",
    "although as bright as sn 1998bw before maximum , sn 2003dh was significantly fainter after maximum , resulting in relatively narrow lcs . in case i , the brightness discrepancy increases from @xmath21 mag around rest - frame day 20 to @xmath77 mag around day 70 , while in case ii it is mostly @xmath74 mag after maximum .",
    "the lc decline is about 1.4 times faster than sn 1998bw in case i , confirming the result of @xcite . the case ii lc resembles the solution suggested by @xcite , i.e. , that the lc of sn 2003dh is similar to that of sn 1998bw stretched by 0.8 times and attenuated by 0.3 mag . on the other hand , the above differences notwithstanding , sn 2003dh is still much more similar to sn 1998bw than to the other sne shown in the figure with regard to the bolometric lc .",
    "we suggest that the peak brightness of sn 2003dh is lower than that of sn 1998bw , even though our lcs do not capture the exact time of peak , which lies between rest - frame day 10 and 15 according to @xcite . for case ii this",
    "can easily be seen in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "however , in case i , our april 8 and 10 magnitude points lie above the bolometric lc of sn 1998bw and could lead to a peak almost as bright as sn 1998bw . on the other hand , the corresponding spectra at these epochs in figure [ fig2 ] display sn features not as prominent as on april 6 and 9 .",
    "so it is possible that there is still some residual oa continuum , whose spectrum would not be a power law .",
    "the actual sn lc may pass between the bright april 8 and 10 points and the faint april 6 and 9 points , leading to a somewhat fainter peak than sn 1998bw .",
    "we modeled the bolometric lcs starting from the ejecta model comdh constructed in @xcite .",
    "we modified its mass @xmath78 , kinetic energy @xmath79 , and ejected @xmath80ni mass @xmath81 , while keeping the ratio @xmath82 constant .",
    "comdh is a one - dimensional spherical density structure against velocity that was derived from theoretically synthesizing the sn spectra of april 10 , 24 , and may 8/9 .",
    "it has @xmath83 @xmath4 , @xmath84 ergs , and a @xmath80ni mass of 0.35 @xmath4 . the density structure above 25,000 @xmath85 mimics the hypernova model of sn 1998bw @xcite to reproduce the sn 1998bw - like early - time spectra and very broad lines , while below 15,000 @xmath85 it is adjusted so as to follow the spectral evolution into the sn 1997ef - like later epoch .",
    "our derived sn spectra are similar to those studied by @xcite as far as spectral features are concerned , and the small differences in the total flux are not expected to modify the main results of spectral modeling obtained in that paper .",
    "therefore , we did not model the spectra again , but rather we fixed @xmath82 at the original comdh value , i.e. , @xmath15 , because this ratio , which characterizes the line widths and the strength of line - blending , is the key parameter in spectrum modeling .",
    "we used the same one - dimensional sn radiation hydrodynamical and gamma - ray transfer codes @xcite used in @xcite , but we adopted the treatment of the eddington factor proposed by @xcite , instead of the simple eddington approximation , and we approximated the rosseland mean opacity using an empirical relation to the electron - scattering opacity derived from the tops database @xcite , rather than assuming a constant line opacity .",
    "isotope @xmath80ni was assumed to be homogeneously mixed throughout the ejecta in order to reproduce the rapid brightening before maximum , as in other hypernovae , such as sn 1998bw @xcite , sn 1997ef @xcite , and sn 2002ap @xcite .",
    "since comdh is not the result of an explosion simulation , the other composition was assumed to be 90% o and 10% si .",
    "our synthetic lc of the original comdh is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "our bolometric lc in case i is best - fitted with the slightly reduced values @xmath86 @xmath4 , @xmath87 ergs , and @xmath88 @xmath4 , while that in case ii can be well reproduced using the original comdh .",
    "the best - fitting model lcs are shown in figure [ fig6 ] ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the fitting model parameters for our preferred case i can be relaxed to @xmath89 @xmath4 and @xmath90 ergs , with @xmath91 , if the error bars shown in figure [ fig6 ] are taken into consideration . to derive the upper and lower limits",
    ", we assumed that we had either under- or overestimated the sn flux throughout the postmaximum epochs .",
    "we did not place much weight on fitting the premaximum lc , because it is not well defined , and because the model lc in that phase is more sensitive to the @xmath80ni distribution .",
    "finally , we constrained the most likely range for the @xmath80ni mass to @xmath7 @xmath4 .",
    "we discussed an optimal oa subtraction method to separate the sn spectra from the oa of grb 030329 and to construct the @xmath2 bolometric lc of sn 2003dh .",
    "the lc is narrower than that of sn 1998bw , rising as fast before maximum but reaching a somewhat fainter maximum and declining about 1.2  1.4 times faster afterward . our spherical lc model parameters , @xmath92 @xmath4 and @xmath5 ergs ( @xmath6 ) , allowing for lc uncertainties , are lower than sn 1998bw , which is another grb - associated hypernova and has been modelled with @xmath93 @xmath4 and @xmath94 ergs @xcite .",
    "sn 1997ef , a hypernova displaying no grb , as well as it replica sn 1997dq @xcite , is as massive as sn 1998bw and sn 2003dh but less energetic ( @xmath95 ergs ; @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that sn 2003dh / grb 030329 is the explosion of an @xmath96 @xmath4 c+o star , assuming a central remnant of @xmath55 @xmath4 , which may evolve from an @xmath8 @xmath4 main - sequence star @xcite losing its h and he envelopes through stellar winds or binary accretion @xcite .",
    "the upper limit is comparable to the values used for sn 1998bw , and the lower limit is well above that for sn 2002ap @xcite , a marginal hypernova without an associated grb .",
    "the parameter range could be further narrowed by spectral modeling , as done in @xcite .",
    "however , the result in that paper could be updated if the spectra presented here , which are a little brighter and extend to later epochs , are modelled , although the characteristic parameter @xmath82 is expected to have a similar value .",
    "the model parameters will probably be modified when asymmetry is considered , as was the case for sn 1998bw ( @xcite ) .",
    "the changes in @xmath78 and @xmath80ni mass are not expected to be large , while @xmath79 can be significantly reduced in an asymmetric model , depending on the geometry . in the case of sn 1998bw",
    ", @xcite found an axial ratio of about 3:2 and a viewing angle of about @xmath97 from the pole , by modeling the late - time spectra .",
    "their best - fitting @xmath79 is @xmath98 ergs , i.e. , one - fourth that in the spherical model of @xcite .",
    "the sn 2003dh asymmetry is probably similar .",
    "this is modest compared to the grb .",
    "@xcite detected marginal polarization ( @xmath99 ) in 2003 may and suggested that it was mostly of local interstellar origin .",
    "@xcite reported an ot polarization level of @xmath100 at times between @xmath101 and 40 days after the grb and assumed that interstellar polarization was negligible .",
    "this polarization level seems consistent with other envelope - stripped core - collapse sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) and may suggest an asphericity of @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the oa flux after april 3  5 derived from our case i spectrum decomposition can be fitted using a power - law decay with an index of @xmath103 ( see figure [ fig7 ] for an example ) .",
    "this is steeper than what was suggested by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath104 after the jet break that occurred around day 3  8 . on the other hand",
    ", we can also fit our results using a broken power law , i.e. , @xmath104 before @xmath17 day 10  11 and @xmath105 after that , in view of the two - jet model of @xcite , who invoked a second , wide jet to explain radio observations and suggested that its break took place around day 10 .",
    "however , the above indices are statistically rough due to the small number of data points , and we can not tell which fitting is better .",
    "we have corrected for the galactic extinction only .",
    "@xcite derived a local reddening of @xmath106 from the balmer decrement of the host galaxy",
    ". however , the assumption of case b recombination underlying this estimate may not be correct .",
    "moreover , their early ot sed constructed from optical - ir photometry is consistent with the case of no local extinction .",
    "the negligible local interstellar polarization ( @xmath107 ) argued by @xcite corresponds to a negligible local @xmath108 @xmath109 mag @xcite , while the values discussed by @xcite may suggest a local @xmath110 mag .",
    "@xcite obtained an upper limit for the local extinction , i.e. , @xmath111 mag , from their early optical - ir photometry , although they adopted this upper limit as the real local extinction value and applied it to their sn lc .",
    "imon , hudec , & pizzichini ( 2004 ) also argued for @xmath112 mag , comparing the colors of the oa with a group of 25 oas .",
    "it is interesting that the three sne with the most convincing grb connections , i.e. , sn 1998bw , sn 2003dh , and sn 2003lw , happen to have relatively similar spectra and lcs , considering the large differences between their respective grbs and the general heterogeneity among hypernovae and among type ic sne .",
    "studies of sn 2003lw revealed sn 1998bw - like spectra and lcs that are probably @xmath113 mag brighter and @xmath114 times broader than sn 1998bw ( @xcite ; p. a. mazzali 2005 , in preparation ) , suggesting a somewhat more massive star .",
    "grb 980425 and grb 031203 were both extremely weak gamma - ray events , @xmath115 being @xmath116 ergs for grb 980425 @xcite and @xmath117 ergs for grb 031203 @xcite , and their respective oa was not detected or was detected only marginally detected @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath115 of grb 030329 is as high as @xmath118 ergs @xcite and its oa dominated the early optical observations , although the beaming - corrected gamma - ray energy , @xmath119 ergs , is still significantly lower than the bulk of normal grbs @xcite .",
    "does this imply any correlation between the progenitor mass , the sn kinetic energy , and the grb / oa intensity ?",
    "on the one hand , it is possible that a more massive star causes the deposition of more energy near the central explosion engine , e.g. , the initial jet . on the other hand",
    ", one may speculate that the grb / oa jet has dissipated more energy to the sn ejecta after penetrating the more massive star , and meanwhile may also have given out more energy to some less relativistic jet component , such as the wide radio component proposed by @xcite .",
    "note that the bulk of the explosion energy for all three events lies in the sn kinetic energy @xmath120 , not in the grb and its afterglow .",
    "thus a small relative change in @xmath120 , e.g. , a positive one , can accompany a big change in the grb energy , positive or not . a positive correlation between @xmath120 and sn ejecta mass can help prevent big differences in the sn spectra , characterized by @xmath121 , and lcs , which have a typical time - scale of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of significantly different viewing angles for the three grbs seems to be disfavored by the spectral similarity of the related sne unless the sn asphericity is small .",
    "@xcite suggest that at least grb 030329 and grb 031203 are compatible with the premise that they are the same event viewed very close to the jet axis and a few degrees away from it , respectively .",
    "the viewing angle of grb 980425 was determined by @xcite to be @xmath123 , on the basis of the nebular line profiles and of aspherical explosion models .",
    "this may require an intrinsically weaker grb .",
    "more examples of grb - sn connections are required to clarify this problem .",
    "@xcite argued that the sn 2002lt hosted in grb 021211 is similar to the normal type ic sn 1994i .",
    "however , the available rest - frame @xmath0-band photometry does not exclude a sn lc as bright and as broad as sn 1998bw . in the case of grb 011121",
    ", @xcite detected a lc `` bump '' in the ot .",
    "based on photometry , they argued for a very blue sn ( named sn 2001ke ) , different from sn 1998bw both in colors and in temporal evolution .",
    "the only available spectrum is unfortunately too noisy to show obvious sn features .",
    "we thank t. matheson , k. s. kawabata , and g. kosugi for the spectra of grb 030329/sn 2003dh ; f. patat for the spectra of sn 1998bw ; and k. z. stanek for important and very helpful comments on the manuscript .",
