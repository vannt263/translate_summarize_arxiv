    "the last nuclear burning phase of a low to intermediate - mass ( @xmath0 to 8@xmath1 ) star s life is the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) .",
    "the outer envelope is lost by low velocity stellar winds during the agb , with the termination being the final ejection of the envelope .",
    "the star then evolves through the brief post - agb and planetary nebula phases before ending its life as a white dwarf .",
    "the gaseous nebula is the remnant of the envelope that once surrounded the core , that is now exposed as the central star of the illuminated nebula .",
    "the abundances of the nebula can reveal information about stellar nucleosynthesis and mixing during the agb . for this reason",
    "pn abundances could , in principle , be used to constrain stellar models .    in this proceedings",
    "i summarize the evolution and nucleosynthesis during the agb .",
    "i briefly discuss the differences between `` synthetic '' and `` detailed '' agb models , and compare yields from different authors .",
    "the structure and evolution of low and intermediate mass stars prior to and during the agb has been previously discussed by @xcite ; see @xcite for a review of post - agb stars .",
    "all stars begin their nuclear - burning life on the main sequence . following core h exhaustion the core contracts , the outer layers expand and the star becomes a red giant , characterized by an inert he core , an h - burning shell , and a deep convective envelope that extends to the stellar surface .",
    "it is during the ascent of the giant branch that the inner edge of the convective envelope moves inward in mass and the first dredge - up ( fdu ) occurs , where partially h - processed material ( e.g. he , c , n ) is mixed to the surface .    after a phase of central he - burning , the core contracts and there is a structural re - adjustment to shell he burning .",
    "the re - adjustment drives a strong expansion of the outer layers and the star becomes a red giant for the second time ; the star is now said to be on the agb . for stars with @xmath2 the convective envelope moves inward to regions where complete h burning ( mostly he and n ) had previously occurred , this is the second dredge up ( sdu ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    an agb star is characterized ( fig .  [ agb ] ) by two nuclear burning shells , one burning he above a degenerate c - o core and another burning h , below a deep convective envelope . in between lies the intershell region composed mostly of he .",
    "the he - burning shell is thermally unstable , flashing every 10@xmath3  years or so .",
    "the energy produced by the thermal pulse ( tp ) drives a convective pocket in the he - intershell which acts to homogenize abundances within that region . after the occurrence of a tp",
    "the convective envelope may move inwards and mix products of partial he - burning ( mostly he left unburnt and c , see fig .",
    "[ agb ] ) from the core to the stellar surface .",
    "this is the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , and is the mechanism responsible for turning ( single ) stars into c stars , where c / o @xmath4 in the surface layers .",
    "the tdu also mixes heavy elements produced by the @xmath5 process from the he - shell to the surface , where they were created during the previous interpulse @xcite .",
    "following dredge - up , the star contracts , the h - shell is re - ignited and the star enters the interpulse phase where h - burning provides most of the luminosity .    hot bottom burning ( hbb ) can occur for stars with @xmath2 , when the base of the convective envelope dips into the top of the h - shell resulting in a thin layer hot enough to sustain proton - capture nucleosynthesis .",
    "observational evidence for hbb includes the lack of bright c - rich agb stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) @xcite ; many of these stars are also rich in li and @xmath5 process elements .",
    "hbb converts c into n and will prevent the atmosphere from becoming c rich @xcite .",
    "the copious amounts of n produced in this case will be primary owing to the primary c being dredged from the he - shell .",
    "intermediate - mass evolution is sensitive to the initial composition and the mass - loss law used in the calculation @xcite , where the minimum stellar mass for hbb is pushed to lower mass in lower metallicity models .",
    "there is evidence from agb stellar spectra @xcite , and from pre - solar grains @xcite that `` extra - mixing '' processes are also operating in low - mass ( @xmath6 ) agb stars , along with the tdu .",
    "the physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the extra mixing are not known , although various processes have been proposed including rotation and thermohaline mixing .",
    "the presence of a binary companion could have dramatic consequences for the evolution and nucleosynthesis , however i leave discussions to izzard , taam and podsiadlowski ( these proceedings ) .",
    "owing to fact that calculating a tp - agb model is a computationally intensive task , synthetic agb models , which use fitting formulae to model the evolution quickly , have proved to be a successful approach for population syntheses studies that require @xmath7 stars .",
    "historically this approach was validated by the fact that the stellar luminosity on the agb is nearly a linear function of the core mass @xcite , although this relation breaks down for stars undergoing hbb @xcite .",
    "synthetic agb models have successfully been used to model agb populations @xcite , and compute stellar yields @xcite .",
    "many of the parameterizations used in synthetic evolution studies are derived from detailed stellar models , such as the growth of the h - exhausted core with time , and as such are only accurate over the range in mass and metallicity of the stellar models they are based upon .",
    "an example is provided by @xcite who compute agb yields for initial masses between 0.9 and 8@xmath1 whereas the interpulse - period - core mass relation @xcite they use was only derived for stars with initial masses between 1 and 3@xmath1 .",
    "what affect this has on the yields is unclear since this relation will affect the number of tps during the tp - agb phase and hence the level of chemical enrichment .",
    "recent improvements in computer power mean that grids of detailed agb models can now be produced in a reasonable time @xcite ; however producing yields from @xmath8 agb stars for any given metallicity range is still challenging .",
    "for this reason synthetic models are still preferred for some applications .",
    "an example of the difference between detailed models and the fits used in synthetic agb algorithms is shown in fig .",
    "[ tau - ip ] for the interpulse - period core mass relation .",
    "we show results from detailed agb models of solar composition against two commonly used fits .",
    "the fits are a reasonable match to the detailed models with small core masses ( @xmath9 ) , but under - estimate the growth of the interpulse period for larger core masses .",
    "years ) as a function of core mass ( @xmath1 ) for the @xmath10 stellar models ( colored dots ) .",

    "[ pnyield ] we show an example of the yields for a 3@xmath1 progenitor of solar composition .",
    "the columns contain the species @xmath11 , the atomic weight @xmath12 , followed by the net yield ( in @xmath1 ; see @xcite for the definition ) , the average mass fraction of @xmath11 lost in the wind from the last two tps , @xmath13 , and the initial mass fraction @xmath14 .",
    "the final column is the abundance of @xmath11 by number compared to the number of hydrogen atoms , @xmath15 , in the matter lost over the final two tps .",
    "the online tables include yields for all 74 species included in the nuclear network .",
    "these yields can be directly compared to the composition of pne and as such could be useful for comparisons to objects in the galaxy , lmc and smc .",
    "this is because the initial c , n and o abundances used in the stellar models were taken from abundances derived from hii regions of the magellanic clouds , see @xcite for details ."
