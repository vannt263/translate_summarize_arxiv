    "thin metal films and flat islands on semiconductor or dielectric substrates can be considered as two - dimensional electron systems with properties , which are of interest both from the fundamental point of view and from the perspective of their application in nanoscale electronic devices .",
    "there are a limited number of experimental works focused on quantum size effects in such systems ( for reviews , see @xcite ) due to difficulties in sample fabrication , as well as because of lack of suitable experimental methods .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of metal nanostructures is electron work function .",
    "there are different methods , which enable one to calculate electron structure of slabs consisting of few monoatomic layers .",
    "let us combine them into three groups according to the complexity of computations : i  the sommerfeld electrons in - a - box model ( analytical calculations , slabs and wires ) @xcite ; ii  self - consistent calculations within various versions of jellium model ( slabs and wires ) @xcite ; iii  _ ab initio _ calculations ( slabs ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are illustrated in figure 1 for all these three groups .",
    "an important ingredient of approaches within group iii is the monolayer number in the film ( see dots in figure 1 ) .",
    "for groups i and ii , @xmath0 changes continuously .    in group",
    "i , the fermi energy ( kinetic energy ) @xmath1 is counted from the _ flat _ bottom of conductivity band , while the work function @xmath2 is counted from the vacuum level .",
    "therefore , their size dependencies are `` asymmetric '' .",
    "in addition to quantum oscillations , these quantities contain monotonic size contributions , which , at small film thicknesses , _ together _ show up through inequalities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to the three dimensional ( 3d ) metal ( allowing for the energy counting for @xmath7 )",
    ".    in @xcite , an asymptotic behavior of electron chemical potential for spherical clusters of radius @xmath8 was determined , from which it follows that @xmath9 where @xmath10 for simple metals , @xmath11 .",
    "it is expectable that such a monotonic contribution must appear for films also .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of group i , self - consistent calculations of groups ii and iii ( see figure 1 ) , at small film thickness , point out to the suppression of monotonic dependence ( having an asymptotic ( [ basic ] ) ) by corrections of higher orders of smallness .",
    "for instance , compensation of terms @xmath12 occurs at @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is large , provided @xmath15 .",
    "experimental results also do not allow to draw unambiguous conclusions on the character of monotonic component of @xmath2 : in experiments @xcite , it is absent ( yb films on si substrate ) , while , according to @xcite , it coincides with the one of group i. note that the comparison of a measured work function for the sandwich consisting of ag film on fe(100 ) in @xcite with calculated results for slabs _ in vacuum _ is rather relative .",
    "work function as well as film surface energy in dielectric environment have never been calculated before .",
    "the aim of this work is to compute energy characteristics of metal films in dielectrics .",
    "we suggest a method for self - consistent calculations of equilibrium profiles of electron concentration , effective potential , energy spectrum , and integral characteristics of metal films in dielectrics and dielectric substrates . the developed method is based on a stabilized jellium model @xcite and local density approximation for exchange - correlation potential @xcite , which were used by us before @xcite to analyze characteristics of semi - infinite metal with dielectric coating .",

    "ii , we formulate our model . in section iii",

    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "let us consider a metallic film of thickness @xmath0 at zero temperature .",
    "we direct @xmath16axis perpendicularly to the film surface ( figure 2 ( a ) , @xmath17 ) .        principal identities for the film can be obtained within a model of a rectangular well for conduction electrons . to perform a preliminary analysis",
    ", we suppose that the bottom of the potential well is flat and we count energies starting from its value .",
    "final expression for the kinetic energies of conduction electrons depends only on energy differences ; therefore , energies counting in such a way is allowed .",
    "we study a film of thickness @xmath0 comparable in magnitude to the fermi wavelength @xmath18 of an electron in 3d metal .",
    "the longitudinal sizes of the sample are assumed to be considerably larger than the film thickness ( @xmath19 ) , which leads to the pronounced quantization of the transverse component of the electron momentum .",
    "the three - dimensional schrodinger equation for a quantum box can be separated into one - dimensional equations .",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the eigenvalue of the @xmath22-th perpendicular state @xmath23 ( hereafter the hartree atomic units are used : @xmath24 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath21 is the bottom of the @xmath22-th subband . for finite and periodic systems in the z - direction dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions",

    "if the thicknesses of the dielectrics on the surfaces of the metal film are foreseen to be less than the free path of an electron ( tens of angstrom ) injected into these dielectrics , then the calculated work function is qualitatively appropriate for the vacuum - dielectric - metal slab - dielectric - vacuum .    for symmetric sandwich the effect of a dielectric coating on the surfaces",

    "one can see the friedel oscillations of electron density with peaks near geometrical boundaries .",
    "the period of oscillations is close to @xmath109 and only weakly depends on the presence of dielectric coatings .",
    "the situation is similar for na and pb films .    at the boundaries between the metal film and the coatings ,",
    "there are jumps in the derivative of the electrostatic potential @xmath119 , which disappear , provided the dielectric constants of the coatings are equal to 1 .",
    "these jumps are due to the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) at @xmath120 .",
    "the jumps are also reflected on @xmath111 profile , since @xmath73 is one of its components .",
    "in addition , at the borders , there are another jumps of not only the derivative @xmath121 , but also of @xmath111 profile itself for any values of @xmath122 , including @xmath123 .",
    "such jumps have another origin compared to the first ones .",
    "this fact is linked to some features of the model @xcite , namely to the presence of the effective potential component @xmath124 .",
    "these nonphysical jumps should not be taken into account in the estimation of the effective force @xmath125 it is seen from figure 4 that force orientations are opposite at both sides of the film , so that the film in whole must be stressed .",
    "the existence of the force should lead to the increase of spacings between some lattice planes @xmath62 , while spacings between other planes must become narrower .",
    "the depth of the potential well @xmath126 , in which the electrons are located in metal film , decreases `` in average '' with increasing @xmath122 and , as a result ,",
    "the electron work function also decreases ( see figure 6 ) .",

    ", this dependence is only decreasing . due to smoother edges of the self - consistent well",

    "difference in subbands numbers significantly affects calculated dielectric function and optical conductivity of the nanofilm @xcite .    within the rectangular - box model , in contrast to the sj model , @xmath130 is always located above one for 3d metal .",
    "amplitudes of oscillations decrease as @xmath0 increases . within both models ,",
    "maximum fermi energies ( minimum work functions ( [ eqwf ] ) ) correspond to the points , in which curves of eigenenergies intersect fermi energies . within the sj model , in contrast to the rectangular - box model , minimum fermi energies correspond to the points , in which fermi energy is located between two nearest eigenenergies ( magic film thicknesses similar to magic numbers in clusters ) .",
    "asymmetric sandwiches @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which contacts the air or vacuum , are of particular interest from the viewpoint of experimental investigation due to the perspective of their use in technological applications .",
    "for instance , these are films on si ( @xmath133 ) or ge ( @xmath134 ) substrates with different concentration of impurities and crystallographic orientations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider both electron density and potential profiles for the polycrystalline film @xmath113 .",
    "presence of a dielectric at the right side of the film leads to the asymmetry of electron distribution ( see the insets in figure 4 ) , so that there appears a hump in both the electrostatic and effective potential at the left side above the vacuum level .",
    "this should result , for example , in the anisotropy of a field emission along the @xmath16axis .",
    "it is worth mentioning that bottoms of wells for sandwiches @xmath113 and @xmath114 are essentially the same , some difference appears only in `` tails '' of potential profiles .",
    "it is of interest to compare heights of humps at @xmath135 and 20 , 22 , 23.5 @xmath105 .",
    "these thicknesses correspond to the minimum , maximum , minimum of the dependence @xmath2 for @xmath136 .",
    "it turns out that , with the increase of @xmath0 , the hump height weakly oscillates and decays similarly to the work function , but maxima of the hump height corresponds to minima of the @xmath2 . for the values of @xmath0 , as given above , these heights are 0.176 , 0.148 , 0.170 and 0.158 , 0.139 , 0.156 ev , respectively .    in order to analyze such a behavior of potential profiles ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the isotropic model based on a defined ( [ rhho ] ) distribution of _ homogeneous _ positively charged background , i.e. one has to take into account not only the reaction of the electron subsystem , but also the reaction of the ion subsystem to the presence of a dielectric .",
    "spacings between the lattice planes are determined by the balance of forces from the right and left sides for each plane .",
    "a simplest realization of this idea is to disregard variations of spacings between the lattice planes and to vary the profile of the ion jellium distribution ( [ rhho ] ) .",
    "we found that such a procedure leads to a significant deformation of the well bottom , but does not result to considerable changes of both the spectrum and hump height .",
    "figures 6 show results of our calculations of both the electron work function and surface energy for crystalline sandwiches using expression ( [ eqsurfen ] ) .",
    "horizontal lines correspond to semiinfinite samples .",
    "in contrast to the surface energy , size dependences @xmath2 have deep and pronounced minima .",
    "it is easier to analyze them using a simple model @xcite",
    ". amplitudes of largest work function `` oscillations '' are smaller than 0.5 ev . by considering dependencies for different metals , it is easy to see that all the differences are due to values of @xmath137 . for the al , which has the smallest @xmath137 ,",
    "work function oscillations are maximum , while the period is minimum . positions of both maxima and minima depend weakly on @xmath122 of a dielectric and slightly shift towards smaller @xmath0 with the increase of @xmath122 .",
    "in contrast to the work function , surface energy oscillations can be approximated by analytical dependences @xmath138 with parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "maxima of function @xmath2 , @xmath141 correspond to `` magic '' film thicknesses , which are defined by maximum occupation of a given subband .",
    "the unexpectable result of self - consistent calculations is a coincidence of dependencies @xmath2 for sandwiches @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "computations for @xmath144 and @xmath145 give a similar result .",
    "this means that the electron work function for asymmetric sandwiches @xmath146 coincides with high accuracy with the work function for symmetric sandwiches @xmath147 with the averaged value @xmath148 .",
    "work function has both the bulk and surface contributions . because bulk metal contributions @xmath2 for sandwiches @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the same by definition , also the same are contributions of dipole surface barriers .",
    "we here imply the total contribution of both sides of a sandwich , since the work function is an `` _ _ isotropic _ _ ''",
    "a coincidence of work functions is most likely a geometric effect .",
    "this feature will be addressed elsewhere .    for surface energies ,",
    "such a coincidence does not exist .",
    "it is not difficult to perform calculations according to formulas ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) , if @xmath87 are known .",
    "we proposed a method for the self - consistent calculations of spectra , electron work function , and surface energy of metal films placed into passive dielectrics .",
    "as typical examples , we considered na , al , and pb films .",
    "the effective force acting on the film from the outside is due to the inhomogeneous electron distribution .",
    "this force should lead to film stressing in a transverse direction .",
    "the effect of the stressing generally becomes more significant with the increase of the film thickness .",
    "in contrast to the surface energy , size dependencies of work function have deep and strongly pronounced minima .",
    "the smaller @xmath137 the more difficult the problem of numerical analysis of size dependencies in the vicinities of these minima .    with the increase of film thickness up to few @xmath151 , size variations of both the work function and surface energy",
    "occur near their average values ( for symmetric sandwiches , these values correspond to 3d metals and do not contain significant monotonous size contributions ) . dielectric environment generally leads to the decrease of electron work function and surface energy .",
    "we also considered asymmetric metal - dielectric sandwiches characterized by different dielectrics at both sides of the film .",
    "one of the examples of such systems is a film on the dielectric substrate .",
    "we found that the presence of a dielectric from one side of the film leads to such a `` deformation '' of electron distribution that there appears a `` hump '' above the vacuum level both in the electrostatic and effective potentials .",
    "the asymmetry of potential profile of this kind should lead to an anisotropy of the field emission .",
    "in addition to size dependencies , the shift of the work function is generally determined by the average dielectric constants of environments .    obtained",
