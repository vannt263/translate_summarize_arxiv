    "the @xmath2  model predicts that structure forms in a hierarchical manner . the first objects to collapse and virialize at high redshift are",
    "small dark matter haloes that later merge to form larger objects .",
    "small haloes that host satellite or dwarf galaxies , can often survive the violent process associated with halo mergers for many giga - years providing important information about galaxy formation , the population of subhaloes , and even the nature of dark matter .",
    "moreover these dark matter structures form an intricate pattern on the megaparsec scale , known as `` cosmic web '' @xcite , consisting of regions termed voids , filaments , sheets and knots .",
    "the cosmic web is a direct consequence of the gravitational instabilities that emerge out of the primordial density field .",
    "the presence of such cosmic pattern has been confirmed observationally by the distribution of the galaxies from the large surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; * ? ? ? * ) and the cosmicflow-2 survey of peculiar velocities @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have examined how the cosmic web can affect specific halo properties such as abundance , shape , or assembly history @xcite .",
    "correlations have also been found between halo spin and the principle axis of filaments ( their spine ) and walls ( their normal ) that they are embedded in @xcite .",
    "although more difficult to quantify owing to degeneracies and inherent biases , similar studies have been conducted in observational samples @xcite . at @xmath3 @xcite",
    "found that the spatial distribution of galaxies within ly@xmath4 haloes trace the underlying large - scale filamentary structure of the universe .",
    "the morphology and spatial extent of ly@xmath4 haloes depend on the environment as well @xcite .",
    "tying galaxy or halo properties to the environment is not a new idea and many studies have quantified the importance of such relations for galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the larger scales of the cosmic web , the properties of galaxies depend on the cosmic filament it inhabits ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or on the supercluster environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , to date no observational studies have examined the effect of the cosmic web environment on satellite galaxies .    analyzing satellite systems of external galaxies is challenging , because typically only several satellites are detected per primary galaxy .",
    "furthermore the real space position of a satellite with respect to its primary is uncertain .",
    "owing to the advent of large galaxy surveys , a statistically robust estimate of the satellite luminosity function ( lf ) has become possible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this study",
    ", we investigate if the satellite lf depends on whether the host galaxy is located within a filament .",
    "we divide isolated primary galaxies into two categories : those within galaxy filaments defined by the `` bisous process '' as in @xcite and those not in these filaments .",
    "each subsample is then divided into three bins according to the primary s magnitude .",
    "the resulting subsamples enable us to study the satellite lfs of isolated primary galaxies in filaments and compare it with isolated primary galaxies that are not in filaments .",
    "such an analysis will quantify how the filament environment affects galaxy formation .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a fiducial @xmath5 cosmological model with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 km  s@xmath9mpc@xmath9 .",
    "throughout this paper we refer to isolated _ primary _ galaxies ( or just _ `` primaries '' _ ) as the central galaxies that host systems of fainter satellites and fulfill a set isolation criteria , detailed below .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to identify isolated primaries . in order to do",
    "so we use the isolated primary catalogue selected by @xcite .    here , potential primaries are drawn from the sdss dr8 spectroscopic survey .",
    "all galaxies within a projected distance of @xmath10 of a potential primary are examined ( see below for the definition of @xmath11 ) .",
    "these must be more than half a magnitude fainter than a prospective host , unless the spectroscopic redshift difference is greater than 0.002 . if a galaxy within @xmath10 only has a photometric redshift , than the host is considered isolated only if the the difference between the host s spectroscopic redshift and the interloper s photometric redshift is greater than 2.5 times the photometric error . as a sanity",
    "check our isolated sample is cross matched with the group catalogue of yang et al ( 2007 ) - an insignificant fraction of our primaries are considered members of groups according to yang et al ( 2007 ) . omitting these has no discernible effect on our results .",
    "we use de - reddened @xmath12 bands model magnitudes and @xmath13-correct all galaxies to @xmath14 with the idl code of @xcite .",
    "satellite galaxies are drawn from both spectroscopic and photometric samples @xcite .",
    "since the photometric redshifts constrain the distance of a satellite poorly , it is impossible to properly de - project a potential satellite .",
    "thus a statistical background subtraction technique is used to estimate the real satellite galaxy population around each primary ( see section  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by defining two radii , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath15 represents the projected radius within which satellites may reside .",
    "the annulus @xmath17 defines the region within which the local background is estimated .",
    "the luminosity function in this annulus is computed for each primary and then subtracted from the luminosity function within @xmath15 .",
    "the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 depend on the primary s magnitude .",
    "we divide the primary sample into three @xmath18-band magnitude bins , each one magnitude wide and centred on @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the values of @xmath23 are ( 0.3 , 0.6 ) , ( 0.4 , 0.8 ) and ( 0.55 , 0.9 )  mpc , respectively ( see @xcite for details on the choice of these values . )",
    "the magnitude bins correspond to haloes with mean virial radii of around 240 , 370 , 520  kpc respectively @xcite .",
    "finally , the background - subtracted satellite lfs for each isolated primary in a given absolute magnitude bin is averaged , resulting in an estimate of the mean satellite lf .",
    "@xcite verified that the methodology described above returns the true satellite lf when applied to galaxy samples in simulations .",
    "we also examine the projected number density profiles of satellites more luminous than a particular absolute magnitude ( in appendix  [ appendix : profile ] , as described more fully in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such density profiles are shown in units of @xmath24 and divided by the total number of satellites within this radius .",
    "the values of @xmath24 are the same as in @xcite and equal to 0.24 , 0.37 , 0.52  mpc for three magnitude bins respectively .",
    "finally , the effects of incompleteness and other biases are examined in appendix  [ appendix : test ] .",
    "the catalogue of filaments is built by applying an object point process with interactions ( the bisous process ) to the distribution of galaxies in the spectroscopic galaxy sample from sdss dr8 as described in @xcite .",
    "random small segments ( cylinders ) based on the positions of galaxies are used to construct a filamentary network by examining the connectivity and alignment of these segments . a filamentary spine",
    "can then be extracted based on a detection probability and filament orientation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the catalogue of filaments ( `` filament spines '' ) we use in this study is the same that of @xcite , where the assumed filament radius is roughly @xmath25 .",
    "this means that primary galaxies in filaments are less than 0.71  mpc from the filament spine .",
    "this catalogue is constructed from the full spectroscopic galaxy sample with lower and upper cmb - corrected distance limits of @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "we thus confine our analysis to this redshift range .",
    "filaments at higher redshift than the upper limit are too `` diluted '' to be detected . we classify a galaxy as `` in - a - filaments '' if the distance of the galaxy from the axis of the filament is less than @xmath28 and the distance of the galaxy from the end point of filament ( if the galaxy is outside a filamentary cylinder ) is less than 0.14  mpc .      for each magnitude bin @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31",
    "there are 4425 ( 22795 ) , 3077 ( 27857 ) , 740 ( 4875 ) primaries in filaments ( not in filaments ) .",
    "thus the fraction of isolated galaxies in filaments is roughly 18.5% , 11.0% and 15.1% , respectively .",
    "the ( normalized ) redshift distribution of primaries ( in and not in filaments ) is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig1_rs ] . at a given magnitude",
    ", the redshift distribution of galaxies in filaments tends to peak at lower @xmath32 than those not in filaments . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : fig1_rs ] we show the fraction of isolated galaxies in filaments as a function of redshift for our three magnitude bins .",
    "these vary from @xmath3350% at low @xmath32 to @xmath34 at the limit of our redshift range .",
    "such a dramatic drop is mainly driven by the filament finding algorithm : the probability of detecting filaments decreases significantly in the redshift range considered here ( namely from @xmath26 to 0.15 , see * ? ? ?",
    "this is because filaments are identified in the flux - limited galaxy sample : as one goes to higher @xmath32 the number density of galaxies decreases significantly , making the identification of filaments more difficult . also note that the catalogue from which primaries are drawn is also flux - limited : the number of galaxies also decreases with redshift .",
    "thus the combined effect of lower number density of isolated galaxies with fewer identifiable filaments at high redshift results in the number of isolated galaxies in filaments going to null at @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the dramatic drop of primaries found in filaments at higher @xmath32 is _ not _ a real feature of the galaxy distribution .    therefore , we exclude galaxies at high ( @xmath35 ) and at low ( @xmath36 ) redshifts , since these redshifts are not well covered by the filament catalogue .",
    "we only consider primaries in the redshift ranges @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for magnitudes of @xmath40 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , in order to ensure that the fraction of primaries in filaments is kept at around ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the satellite lf for primaries in and not in filaments is shown in top panel of figure  [ fig : fig2_lf ] . for the magnitude bin @xmath42",
    ", the small number of primaries results in a lf that is too noisy to show any difference ( if one existed ) : the mean number of satellites around these low luminosity primary galaxies is intrinsically lower than that of brighter primaries and the number of these low - luminosity primaries found in filaments is not sufficiently high to have good signal - to - noise ratio .    beyond the faintest magnitude bin ,",
    "the satellites lf of primaries in filaments ( extending to at least 4 magnitudes fainter than the primary ) is significantly higher than those of primaries that are not in filaments . at the bright end of the satellite lfs",
    "we find that there are roughly double the number of satellites around primaries that are in filaments compared those that are not in the filaments .",
    "this is our main result : _ at a given magnitude , isolated galaxies in filaments have more bright satellites than isolated galaxies that are not in filaments_.    since the fractions of galaxies in filaments varies significantly with the redshift , we wish to test whether the difference in the satellite lfs we have seen is caused by the bias in the redshift distribution .",
    "we thus perform a number of tests described in section  [ sect : weighting ] to [ sect : controlsample ] .",
    "suppose our main result - that galaxies in filaments have _ on average _ more satellites - is driven by the a redshift evolution of the satellite lf combined with the decreasing likelihood in finding isolated primaries in filaments . in order to control for this possibility",
    ", the contribution to the mean `` not - in - filament '' satellite lf from a given primary is weighted according to what fraction of all galaxies , at that @xmath32 , are found in filaments and what fraction are not .",
    "for example , at @xmath43 most galaxies ( 68% ) ( in magnitude bin @xmath44 ) are not in filaments .",
    "thus when we compute the contribution for a primary that is not found in filaments and in this redshift range to the mean lf , we weigh its satellite lf by 0.47 ( = 32/68 ) . in this way redshift",
    "ranges where filaments are easily detected and redshift ranges where filaments are not easily detected are given inverse weights . if the result we have found is driven by a redshift dependent satellite lf , such a test should give identical satellite lfs for in filament and not - in - filament samples .",
    "the satellite lf with weighting is thus estimated as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of satellites around primary galaxy @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the weight for the primary galaxy @xmath47 and @xmath49 is the number of primaries contributing to the @xmath50th bin of the lf .",
    "the weight @xmath48 for each primary galaxy is determined by the aforementioned way .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ fig : fig3_lfw ] shows the resulting satellite lfs with the aforementioned weighting from the redshift distribution of primary galaxies not in filaments for the magnitude bins @xmath44 and @xmath22 .",
    "the weighted satellites lf for in filament primaries is still significantly different from those not in filaments ( in a given magnitude bin ) .",
    "note that the weighted satellite lfs for primaries not in filaments are noisier because fewer primaries are able to contribute to the estimation of the mean satellite lfs .",
    "this suggests that the redshift bias can not account for the differences between the satellite lfs in filaments .    now , suppose our main result is driven by the primary colour distribution .",
    "a similarly weighted satellite lfs can be estimated in the same way but with weightings determined such that the distribution of @xmath51 colours ( rather than the distribution of redshifts ) between filament and non - filament primaries match .",
    "again , such a lf suggests that a potential colour bias also fails to account for the difference in satellite lf ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fig3_lfw ] ) .",
    "another source of possible systematic bias is the different environmental densities around primary galaxies in filaments and not in filaments .",
    "this has been checked and statistically the primary galaxies in filaments and not in filaments have the same distribution of environmental densities . in summary : _ the difference in filament and non - filament satellite lf can not be attributed to an underlying colour , redshift or environmental density bias .",
    "the filament and non - filament satellite lfs are intrinsically different_.      to further explore how the changing fractions of primaries in - filaments can influence the differences between the satellite lfs , we split the in - filaments and not - in - filaments primaries into `` near '' ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 for @xmath54 respectively ) and `` far '' ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) subsamples .",
    "the resulting satellite lfs for these subsamples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_redshift ] .",
    "the satellites lfs for in filament and not - in - filament primaries are still significantly different for both near and far subsamples , although the differences in far subsamples are smaller than those in near subsamples .",
    "this could be caused by the fact that the contamination in not - in - filaments primaries in far subsamples is higher than that in near subsamples , i.e. more in - filaments galaxies in far subsamples may be mis - classified as not - in - filaments .",
    "the weighted satellite lfs of galaxies not in filaments are shown in the two bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_redshift ] as an attempt to minimise the redshift - bias between the in - filament galaxies and the not - in - filaments ones in both near and far subsamples . due to the small number of primaries in the subsamples which are able to contribute the estimation of the weighted satellite lfs , the results are quite noisy .",
    "however the difference between the mean of satellite lfs in filaments and not in filaments can still be seen .    in each magnitude bin , only around 15% of isolated galaxies are found in filaments .",
    "we wish to check if the difference in the satellite lf is due to the variance of this small fraction .",
    "we do so by comparing the mean in - filament satellite lfs to the mean of ( a random set of ) 500 not - in - filament satellite lfs .",
    "this set of 500 random satellite lfs matches both the redshift range and the number of the in - filaments galaxies .",
    "again , we split these into near and far samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf_frac ] shows the results of comparing these .",
    "the difference between the mean satellite lfs of in - filaments galaxies and of a randomly drawn , equally sized and redshift distributed not - in - filaments sample in both near and far ranges , is robust and statistically significant ( at the @xmath57 level ) .    is our result valid if the redshift range is confined to small interval ? in figure  [ fig : lf_frac_slice ] we show the satellite lf in two relatively narrow redshift slices ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 ) . in these narrow redshift ranges , the fractions of in - filaments primaries",
    "varies very little .",
    "the comparison of satellite lfs is thus less biased by counting statistics .",
    "moreover , bright satellites in these redshift slices are quite far from the faint limits of the sdss .",
    "the estimation of the mean satellite lfs is therefore less affected by possible incompleteness .",
    "the results from these subsamples again show that the mean satellite lfs of in - filaments galaxies and not - in - filaments galaxies are significantly different .",
    "to summarize : the difference between the satellite lfs of in - filament and not - in - filament primaries are seen in a wide range of subsamples .",
    "the fact that the fraction of galaxies in - filaments varies with the redshift dramatically is thus insufficient to explain the difference in the satellite lf .",
    "[ sect : controlsample ]    besides the different redshift and colour distributions of the two samples , the classification of primaries as in - filaments and not - in - filaments could introduce other potential biases which can individually or together result in the differences seen here . to take such an effect into account",
    ", we build control samples from the not - in - filament catalogue .",
    "we then compare the mean satellite lfs estimated from galaxies in - filaments with a corresponding control samples of galaxies not - in - filaments . for each primary",
    "found in a filament , we select a unique counterpart from the corresponding not - in - filament control sample .",
    "the counterpart is selected to have the same @xmath61 colour , visible axis ratio @xmath62 , redshift and magnitude . given a filament primary , we select a counterpart by finding the not - in - filament galaxy which minimizes the following cost :    @xmath63    where the quantities @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the difference between the redshift , @xmath18 band magnitude , @xmath61 colour and axis ratio between the filament primary and not - in - filament candidate .",
    "the denominators of each term are the scaling factors that correspond to the standard deviation of distribution of each quantity .",
    "the general properties of our control sample drawn from primaries not - in - filaments is shown in figure  [ fig : comp_p ] .",
    "note that our technique of minimizing the cost @xmath68 is successful : figure  [ fig : comp_p ] shows little difference between in filament primaries and the control sample .",
    "this makes the comparison of the mean satellite lfs from these two groups less biased .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf_control ] shows the mean satellite lfs of in - filaments and not - in - filaments galaxies of the control samples , which again confirms the differences between the satellite lfs of in - filaments and not - in - filaments galaxies is not caused by a possible bias in the distribution of magnitudes , redshift , colour , or visible axis ratio of the primary galaxies .",
    "we have examined the luminosity function ( lf ) of satellites close to isolated primary galaxies in the sdss .",
    "isolated primary galaxies have been split by filamentary environment into two camps : those primaries in and not in filaments .",
    "background galaxies are subtracted statistically and the mean satellite lf is computed by stacking all centrals of a given absolute @xmath18 band magnitude .",
    "our results indicate that primaries in filaments have more satellites than those that are not found in filamentary environments .",
    "this is most evident for the brightest satellites but is true for satellites up to 4 magnitudes fainter of their host . except for the faintest magnitude bin ( where the signal - to - noise is too low to judge ) , in - filament primaries have a factor of @xmath69@xmath70 more bright satellites than primaries not in filaments .",
    "this slightly varies with redshift possibly because the contamination in the sample of galaxies not in filaments increases with the redshift .",
    "we have examined if the difference in the satellite lf is due to other controlling factors including differences in colour , density , redshift distribution or variance of small sample sizes .",
    "none of these control factors can explain the result found here .",
    "the differences exhibited are statistically significant and robust and thus reflect an inherent difference in the satellite population of galaxies in and not in filaments .",
    "we have also examined the mean radial distribution of satellites brighter than a @xmath18-band magnitude of @xmath71 in appendix  [ appendix : profile ] and found no significant difference in the projected spatial distribution of satellites in or not in filaments in spite of the obvious difference between the total numbers of satellites .",
    "previous numerical studies have shown that the abundance of dark matter subhaloes may depend on the environment : haloes in filaments may have more subhaloes than those in other cosmic web environments ( cautun et al . in preparation",
    "the properties of subhaloes in filaments can be also different from those in the other environments and this may affect galaxy formation since the satellite lf is a result of the gas physics that regulate star formation in small haloes .",
    "our results thus suggest that galaxy formation itself may be more efficient in subhaloes that are born in and accreted through filaments",

    "we perform a few more tests to see if our estimated satellite lfs are also robust in terms of other possible incompleteness or biases . in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] ( titled : `` varying the magnitude limit @xmath77 '' ) , we reduce the faint magnitude cut of the input catalogue used for searching for satellites . the resulting satellite lfs at the bright end is nearly identical .",
    "such a cut causes only small variations in the faint end of the satellite lfs .",
    "a similar situation is seen if we vary the surface brightness cut for the input catalogue ( upper right of fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] ) .",
    "figure  5 of @xcite shows that the galaxy catalogue is not complete due to preferentially missing low surface brightness galaxies . with the bright magnitude cut",
    ", such incompleteness is greatly reduced . therefore varying the surface brightness cut",
    "does not affect the satellite lfs . in the region close to the primary galaxies , spiral arms fragments",
    "could be occasionally erroneously misclassified as separate galaxies .",
    "moreover the completeness in the region close to primary is poor since the light of the central galaxy dominates this region .",
    "for such incompleteness , we compare the satellite lfs estimated with and without excluding the galaxies within a radius of 1.5 times the petrosian @xmath78 of the primary galaxies , shown in the lower left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] ( entitled `` varying the inner radius cut '' ) .",
    "the result shows that such incompleteness is not important in the computation of the satellite lf .",
    "this is because the @xmath78 is small .",
    "we thus infer that objects found at these distances contribute little to the mean satellite lfs . in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] , we test the dependence of the estimated satellite lfs on the redshift of primary galaxies .",
    "the primary galaxies are split into subsamples at low and high redshift according to the median of the redshift distribution of all isolated galaxies in the magnitude bins .",
    "the satellites lfs estimated from the sample of primary galaxies at low redshift are compared with those from the sample of primary galaxies at high redshift , shows that only for the @xmath79 bin is the satellite lfs slightly different . however , such variation is not enough to account for the difference between the satellite lfs of in - filaments galaxies and not - in - filaments galaxies . for tests of the dependence on the redshift of primary galaxies",
    "we refer the reader to the section  [ sec : redshift ] for more details .    in summary ,",
    "our tests show that our estimated satellite lfs of isolated primaries , especially the bright end , are quite robust to parameter selections , incompleteness or biases .",
    "there is thus no evidence that the differences in the satellite lfs of in - filaments and not - in - filament galaxies is anything other than a real physical effect .",
    "the difference at the bright end of the satellite lfs for these two subsamples is most significant in the brightest two magnitude bins .",
    "we therefore show the radial distribution of satellites in and not in filaments ( for @xmath80 ) in figure  [ fig : fig4_pro ] . in spite of the fact that the total number of satellites depends strongly on whether the primary is inside a filament or not , the mean radial distributions of satellites in these two environments are remarkably similar to each other .",
    "however for the magnitude bin @xmath44 , the radial distribution of satellites brighter than @xmath71 magnitude in @xmath18 band seems slightly less centrally concentrated in filaments than not - in - filaments .",
    "this may be caused by the limited volume of the primary galaxies in filaments , since the result is relative noisy ."
