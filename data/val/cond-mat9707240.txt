    "in contrast to neutral polymers polyelectrolytes are bearing ionizable groups , that are able to dissociate into charged polymer chains and small counter - ions .",
    "the interest in polyelectrolytes reaches back to the early days of polymer science ( see e.g. @xcite ) , due to their fundamental importance in biology , biochemistry as well as in industrial applications .",
    "proteins , nucleic acids and superabsorber materials are only a few examples out of the wide range of practical interest in polyelectrolytes .",
    "nevertheless they belong to the least understood systems in macromolecular science @xcite .",
    "the reason why they are much less understood than for example neutral polymers lies in the difficulty to apply renormalization group theories and scaling ideas to systems in which long range ( i.e. coulomb ) forces are present , which means that the range of the forces is of the order of the polymer size .    for many applications knowledge about",
    "the elastic behavior of polyelectrolytes is of fundamental importance .",
    "one of them is , for example , to understand the elastic behavior of superabsorber materials , i.e. , polyelectrolyte networks and their thermodynamic properties .",
    "most important amongst them is naturally the swelling behavior .    the elastic and the thermodynamic properties of classical networks formed by crosslinking of neutral polymer chains",
    "have been considered by simple and successful theories @xcite .",
    "the success of these theories lies in the fact that most of them are based on the assumption that the elasticity of the entire network is roughly given by the elasticity of a representative single chain in the cross - linked network ( see for example @xcite , @xcite for reviews ) . many theories including those which consider entanglements , work very well for dry networks , i.e. , networks that are not swollen by a good solvent .",
    "the case where the networks are at equilibrium swelling at the so - called @xmath3 point , when the blob size is precisely identical to the radius of gyration of the mesh @xcite is especially interesting . in this case",
    "the network elasticity can be computed by the knowledge of the conformational behavior of a single swollen chain @xcite .",
    "naturally these simple theories are suitable for many purposes but are , of course on the other hand , unable to answer difficult questions such as the liquid solid transition , etc @xcite , but this is not the subject of the present paper .",
    "we would like to address another important issue of the subject of network elasticity . in all theories",
    "the effects of interactions have been neglected . in the classical theories",
    "it was assumed by purpose of mathematical simplicity that any interactions between the chains to do not contribute to the elastic properties .",
    "this is most likely valid for neutral polymer networks , because in dense systems the excluded volume forces between the chains are screened to a large extend . in polyelectrolyte networks",
    "this is definitely not the case , because strong interactions between monomers rule the conformational behavior @xcite .",
    "indeed little is known about the interplay of elasticity ( conformation ) and strength of the interactions in the theory of network elasticity .    to get a first insight and physical feeling for the interplay of these effects , it is useful and legal to consider single chain elasticity in weakly charged and flexible polyelectrolyte chains , although the simple generalizations as carried out for neutral networks are not promising . on the other hand simple scaling considerations as done for excluded volume chains @xcite",
    "can not be employed _ a priory _ , because several independent length scales are involved .",
    "the first is ( apart from the chain length ) the range of the electrostatic interaction . for simplicity",
    "we use here a screened debye potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 defines the screening length of the electrostatic interactions . the other scale , in neutral saw polymers introduced as pincus blob size @xmath6 via the relation @xmath7 , defines the elastic properties as a function of the excluded volume interaction by the assumption that within scales @xmath6 the chains shows excluded volume behavior .",
    "@xmath0 is the external force acting at the chain ends .",
    "( since we assume @xmath8 constant , the same force acts on each segment along the chain ) .",
    "similar treatment is here not possible , because the interplay between @xmath9 and @xmath6 is unknown .",
    "it has been shown only recently , how a field theory can be set up for the critical behavior , i.e. , chain length @xmath10 of undeformed polyelectrolyte chains @xcite .    as a first step",
    "we calculate the elastic response of a single polyelectrolyte chain in solvent .",
    "therefore we apply an constant external force on the ends of the chain , which corresponds to the application of an external field . here",
    "we follow the simple idea in classical rubber theory , but determine the new propagator of the extended _ interacting _ chain . to do so",
    ", we employ a variational principle and calculate the effective propagator of the chain , which allows statements about the influence of conformation * and * interactions on the elasticity .",
    "although this procedure seems to be oversimplified for several reasons .",
    "the first is that it can not be expected that polyelectrolyte networks can be described by effective single chain models as in networks with short range interactions .",
    "the second reason is that fluctuations are expected to play an important role .",
    "thirdly , the debye - hckel approximation for the electrostatic potential does not seem to be sufficient .",
    "this can be seen in @xcite where the debye - hckel potential simply appears by a random phase approximation in a gaussian density functional theory .",
    "moreover there is great evidence from numerical simulation that the debye - hckel approximations fails under certain circumstances @xcite .",
    "however , the use of the debye approximation together with the assumption that the non interacting chain is gaussian limits the model to weakly charged and flexible polyelectrolytes . nevertheless , despite these drawbacks , we expect first principal result from the theory below .",
    "as such a result we derive the elastic modulus of the single polyelectrolyte chain and compare it the the well known cases , i.e. , free chain and excluded volume chain . as a side remark",
    "we mention that the same method can be used to re - derive the pincus blob model for pure excluded volume chains . in this case",
    "the renormalized propagator can be determined in a field theoretic @xmath11 - expansion @xcite    the starting point of the calculation is the green function of the free chain without interactions . the green function can be viewed as the fourier - laplace transform of the distribution function for the chain ends .",
    "it will be shown that the force in the system is treated through the analytic continuation of the fourier transformed greens function to the complex plane as will be shown in section two .",
    "after having introduced a field theory the problem is mapped on a gaussian field theory with a propagator that formally in the fourier space can be written down exactly by making use of the proper self energy . according to the well known feynman variational inequality the sum of the gaussian free energy and the mean - value of the interacting potential has to be minimized with respect to the proper self energy , which is our variational parameter .",
    "this leads to a non - linear integral equation for the proper self energy , which can be solved systematic approximations .",
    "the result of this consideration is that the chain is stretched in the long ranged limit proportional to the applied force parallel to the force and is pushed proportional to the force perpendicular to it .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the simulation , that is also presented in this paper .",
    "moreover we support the computations by intuitive physical arguments .",
    "the variational calculation and simulation indeed support a scaling picture of the deformation of the polyelectrolyte chain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the mathematical model and provide the definitions . in section 3 we introduce a field theory and calculate the variational equation for the proper self energy . in section 4 this variational equation",
    "is solved approximately .",
    "the results of the analytic calculation are presented in section 5 .",
    "the results of the computational simulation are presented in section 6 .",
    "section 7 is provided with some scaling considerations .",
    "let us first introduce the standard model which is employed here .",
    "since we restrict ourselves to flexible chains which are weakly charged the edwards model is the appropriate tool .",

    "this deformation process corresponds to the first regime in the simulation , i.e. , for forces @xmath159 .    for larger forces ( @xmath160 )",
    "the blob size @xmath161 is no longer important , because the parts of the chain inside the blobs become deformed .",
    "this corresponds to a new pincus regime , where the relevant blob size is now given by @xmath162 .",
    "the simulation clearly divides both regimes at forces @xmath163 .",
    "note that this fact has been already used in the analytical calculation above .",
    "the latter situation is very similar to the case considered by rabin and alexander , when the stretching of polymer brushes has been discussed @xcite .",
    "thus the blob size becomes diminished according to the idea pointed originally out by pincus .",
    "this can be seen clearly from the simulations .",
    "the pincus regime starts then at @xmath164 .",
    "in the previous sections we analyzed the force - size relationship of a single polyelectrolyte chain in a solvent .",
    "first we made theoretical considerations on this problem .",
    "then we compared our results with computer - simulation data and some scaling considerations . in every three cases we find a transition from one to another regime at forces which are about @xmath165 where @xmath166 the debye - hckel screening length in the assumed debye - hckel potential .",
    "the most important result of the present paper is the coupling between conformational degrees of freedom and the interactions in the elastic response of a single chain .",
    "the force is still proportional to the thermal energy @xmath167 , typical entropy elastic chains , but the single chain modulus becomes strongly influenced by the interactions , via the debye screening length @xmath168 .",
    "moreover the simulation data are in agreement with our theoretical predictions , that in the first regime the end - to - end distance of the chain depends linearly on the applied force in the long range limit of the debye - hckel potential , which means in solvents with low salt concentration . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will extend this model and theoretical approach to the case of many crosslinked chains @xcite and make further predictions on the elasticity of polyelectrolyte networks .",
