    "homology can be thought of as a way of using certain subspaces of a variety @xmath1 to describe topological invariants of @xmath1 .",
    "equivariant homology arises in the setting of a variety @xmath1 with the action of a group @xmath0 .",
    "since group actions typically `` fatten '' a space ( see figure [ fattening ] ) , information about both the group and an underlying skeleton in @xmath1 can be used to recover topological information about @xmath1 .    in this paper , we follow the approach of goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson in @xcite , who identify a particular skeleton inside @xmath1 which they use to turn the problem of computing equivariant cohomology into a combinatorial puzzle .",
    "the simplest possible skeleton is a point , but it would be a terribly dull world if the topology of every variety with a group action could be reduced to a point .",
    "the next simplest is a graph , to which the gkm method reduces all suitable varieties .",
    "their main result is to show that if the @xmath0-action on @xmath1 satisfies certain conditions , including having a finite number of fixed points and a finite number of one - dimensional orbits , then the equivariant cohomology of @xmath1 is a submodule of the equivariant cohomology of the set of fixed points in @xmath1 , which is naturally a module over a polynomial ring .",
    "moreover , this submodule can be identified explicitly using relations imposed by the one - dimensional orbits .",
    "all of this data can be encoded in a graph whose vertices correspond to fixed points and whose edges correspond to one - dimensional orbits .",
    "group actions on varieties had been used to obtain topological data long before the paper of goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson .",
    "biaynicki - birula used group actions to decompose varieties into a collection of attracting cells that could be used to describe cohomology , in something like an algebraic analogue of morse theory @xcite . working in symplectic geometry",
    ", kirwan and many others had studied symplectic reductions , namely quotients of a variety by its group action , and had extracted cohomological information using fixed points and their attracting sets .",
    "* theorem 5.4 ) in fact proves in the symplectic setting that the equivariant cohomology of @xmath1 is a submodule of the equivariant cohomology of the fixed points .",
    "an early paper of chang and skjelbred identifies the image of the equivariant cohomology of @xmath1 inside the equivariant cohomology of the fixed points , for more general topological spaces @xmath1 ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2.3 ) .",
    "even earlier contributions came in different forms from borel , atiyah , hsiang , and quillen , among others , as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.7 ) .",
    "the combinatorial data associated to group actions on a variety had also been studied , especially via the moment map .",
    "the moment map , discussed at length in section [ moment map ] , can be thought of here as a combinatorial way to collect data about the group orbits in @xmath1 .",
    "kostant showed that if a torus @xmath2 acts on a coadjoint orbit in the cotangent space @xmath3 to @xmath2 , then the image of the moment map is a convex polytope @xcite .",
    "this theorem inspired a series of papers by various authors , including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite which extended the result to more general groups acting on more general varieties , collectively proving that the image of the moment map is some union of convex polytopes .",
    "what goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson do in their approach to equivariant cohomology is to put these two schools together , using the combinatorial data of the orbits of the group action from moment map theory to encode and interpret topological data of the attracting sets for fixed points from the study of algebraic group actions .",
    "many authors have since built on their work .",
    "we mention a sample of examples in this introduction and give others at relevant moments in the exposition .",
    "gkm theory has been extended to other cohomology theories : to equivariant intersection homology in @xcite and to equivariant k - theory in @xcite .",
    "the class of varieties for which the theory applies has been expanded , for instance in @xcite to torus actions without isolated fixed points .",
    "gkm theory is used to calculate the equivariant cohomology rings of grassmannians @xcite and regular varieties ( which have a unique fixed point with respect to a solvable group action ) in @xcite .",
    "the graphs used in gkm theory are studied in their own right in @xcite .    in order to make this exposition as elementary as possible",
    ", we make several assumptions throughout this paper .",
    "the first is that we work over the complex numbers , so the variety @xmath1 is a complex algebraic variety , the group @xmath0 is a complex linear algebraic group , and all cohomology has complex coefficients .",
    "the second is that the group @xmath0 is in fact an algebraic torus @xmath2 , so @xmath2 is a product of @xmath4 copies of @xmath5 .",
    "when a result is easier to present using the compact torus @xmath6 , we will use that instead , since the equivariant cohomology is the same regardless of whether @xmath7 or @xmath6 is used .",
    "the third assumption is that @xmath1 is nonsingular and complete .",
    "all of these assumptions can be relaxed , but we make no further mention of this .",
    "we also note that there are many things in @xcite which we do not discuss at all in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper provides an introduction to equivariant cohomology following gkm theory .",
    "section [ defining eq cohom ] gives several definitions of equivariant homology and cohomology .",
    "section [ main theorem ] then presents the main theorem due to goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson . in section [ examples ] , we give three different examples caculating equivariant cohomology .",
    "we include in section [ moment map ] a discussion of the moment map in general , which is an important context for the combinatorial graphs used in gkm theory .",
    "finally , section [ generators ] describes how to find a minimal set of generators for the equivariant cohomology , simplifying the explicit calculations that went before .",
    "many people contributed to the preparation of this paper through very useful conversations , including rebecca goldin , allen knutson , robert lazarsfeld , robert macpherson , and david nadler .",
    "tom braden , henry cohn , allen knutson , and robert lazarsfeld read drafts of this paper and provided helpful suggestions .",
    "the anonymous referee s comments were particularly valuable .",
    "the original version of this paper was presented the american mathematical society summer conference for young algebraic geometers .",
    "the author is extremely grateful to the conference organizers for this opportunity .",
    "let @xmath1 be an algebraic variety with an algebraic action of @xmath8 . to define the ordinary homology of @xmath1 , we would use the chain group consisting of formal linear combinations of maps @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a not - too - singular space whose precise characteristics we do not detail here . to incorporate the action of @xmath2",
    ", we modify the definition of the chain group as follows : @xmath11 details about one possible collection @xmath12 may be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the notion of oriented boundaries means that the map @xmath13 is in @xmath14 .",
    "orientations cancel in the usual way , so @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , we may take the homology of the chain complex @xmath16 to get the equivariant homology @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , consider the topological torus with the `` hula - hoop '' action of @xmath18 indicated in figure [ hula torus ] .",
    "there is only one free @xmath19-cycle up to homology , shown in figure [ 1-chain ] .",
    "once any given point @xmath20 on the @xmath19-chain is mapped into the torus , the @xmath18-equivariance of @xmath21 determines the rest of the image .",
    "any two such cycles @xmath22 and @xmath23 differ by the boundary of a @xmath24-chain , and so represent the same homology class .",
    "the class of this cycle thus generates @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , there is only one free @xmath24-cycle up to homology .",
    "the image of this cycle under @xmath21 must surject onto @xmath1 , since any vertical strip in the image is wrapped around the torus by @xmath18-equivariance of the map @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the class of the cycle given by @xmath1 itself generates @xmath26 .",
    "the reader can observe that the equivariant homology of @xmath1 with this @xmath18-action is exactly the same as the ordinary homology of @xmath18 .",
    "this is no coincidence .",
    "it is true because the torus is @xmath18 ( vertically oriented ) , fattened by a free hula - hoop @xmath18-action .",
    "the more general statement also holds .",
    "[ free action ] if a torus @xmath2 acts freely on the algebraic variety @xmath1 and @xmath27 denotes the quotient space of @xmath1 under this @xmath2-action , then @xmath28 .",
    "the proof follows from these definitions .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 need only be a principal @xmath2-bundle for this proposition to hold .",
    "the equivariant cohomology of @xmath1 may be defined as the cohomology of the chain complex @xmath29 .",
    "it is an exercise for the reader that proposition [ free action ] holds for equivariant cohomology , too .",
    "the following definition is more common in the literature .",
    "fix a @xmath2-action on @xmath1 .",
    "proposition [ free action ] says that equivariant cohomology would be easy to define if this @xmath2-action were free .",
    "consequently , our strategy is to modify @xmath1 slightly to obtain a space which does carry a free @xmath2-action .    to do this , take @xmath30 be a contractible space with a free @xmath2-action .",
    "for instance , the group @xmath31 acts naturally on each sphere @xmath32 by rotation . viewing @xmath32 as the unit sphere in @xmath33 , the element @xmath34 in @xmath18 sends @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this action is free , but unfortunately the space @xmath32 is not contractible . to correct for this ,",
    "observe that @xmath32 sits inside @xmath37 as the equator , and that all cycles of dimension at most @xmath38 are contractible in @xmath37 . by taking the union of @xmath32 for all @xmath39",
    ", we obtain the infinite sphere @xmath40 , which is contractible .",
    "this space @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "define @xmath42 to be the quotient @xmath43 ; it is called the classifying space of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , we may construct the classifying space @xmath44 using the example of @xmath41 given before . for each @xmath39 ,",
    "the quotient of @xmath32 by the rotation action of @xmath18 is @xmath45 .",
    "taking the union as before gives a space @xmath46 .",
    "intuitively , the space @xmath46 is constructed by adjoining cells as if to form @xmath47 , but without ever stopping . the diagonal action of @xmath2 on @xmath48 is free , since the action on @xmath30 is free .",
    "define @xmath49 to be the quotient @xmath50 .",
    "this is the total space of a fiber bundle with base @xmath42 and fiber @xmath1 : @xmath51 we define the equivariant cohomology of @xmath1 to be @xmath52    to see what this definition means , we work through the example when @xmath1 is a point and @xmath31 . in this case",
    "this is @xmath54 by definition , and equals @xmath55 .",
    "recall that @xmath56/(t^{k+1})$ ] is generated by the class @xmath57 $ ] of an embedded @xmath58 together with a normal vector .",
    "the argument does not generalize precisely , because it uses poincar duality .",
    "however , the restriction @xmath59 is an isomorphism as long as @xmath60 is at most @xmath61 .",

    "equivariant cohomology satisfies the same canonical properties as ordinary cohomology .",
    "in particular , the following hold :    1 .",
    "functoriality ; 2 .   a ring structure ; 3 .   excision ; 4 .   the mayer - vietoris sequence ; 5 .   the knneth formula",

    "existence of chern classes ,    where all subsets and maps are assumed to be equivariant .",
    "for instance , we can use these properties to show that @xmath63 is a module over @xmath64 .",
    "applying functoriality to the map @xmath65 allows us to pull back each class in @xmath64 to @xmath63 .",
    "the ring structure then permits us to multiply classes coming from @xmath64 with classes in @xmath63 .",
    "of course , the same procedure can be followed in ordinary cohomology , which brings us to a major difference between equivariant and ordinary cohomology : @xmath64 is a very interesting ring , rather than a field .",
    "( one result of this is that the knneth formula and poincar duality in equivariant cohomology may look slightly unfamiliar . )    to identify the ring @xmath64 , suppose the point is acted upon by @xmath66 .",
    "write @xmath67 for the lie algebra of @xmath2 , namely the tangent to @xmath2 at the identity , and write @xmath3 for its dual , the cotangent space . then by the same argument as before @xmath68 , which by the knneth formula is @xmath69 $ ] .",

    "one way to compute the ordinary cohomology of a fiber bundle @xmath49 is to use a leray spectral sequence .",
    "this is in general a complicated problem .",
    "consequently , we restrict to a special class of varieties @xmath1 for which this spectral sequence degenerates in the sense of the next definition .",
    "fix a variety @xmath1 with an action of @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is equivariantly formal with respect to this @xmath2-action if @xmath73 in the spectral sequence associated to the fibration @xmath74 .    in algebraic terms",
    ", equivariant formality implies that @xmath63 is a free module over @xmath64 .",

    "whenever we compute an example of @xmath63 , we will also give generators for @xmath63 as a module over @xmath64 that coincide with module generators for @xmath84 .",
    "in practice , many varieties of interest are equivariantly formal .",
    "for instance , @xcite note that all of the following are equivariantly formal :    1 .   a smooth complex projective algebraic variety ( with respect to any linear algebraic @xmath2-action ) ; 2 .   a variety whose ordinary cohomology vanishes in odd degree ( with respect to any @xmath2-action ) ; 3 .   a variety with a @xmath2-invariant cw - decomposition ; and 4 .   a compact symplectic manifold with a hamiltonian @xmath2-action , where @xmath2 is a compact torus .",

    "our approach to describing @xmath63 in section [ examples ] was to find the most general element of @xmath63 that could be associated to each fixed point .",

    "we continued until all vertices were labelled , each time selecting a lowest neighbor of labelled vertices and determining the most general element of @xmath70 that could be associated to that neighbor while satisfying the edge relations to already labelled vertices .",
    "we now give a computationally simpler and more systematic method for constructing elements of @xmath63 given a moment graph for @xmath1 .",
    "denote the edge between vertices @xmath307 and @xmath272 by @xmath308 and denote the direction of this edge @xmath309 . fix a vertex @xmath273 and label all vertices @xmath272 such that @xmath290 in the partial order with the function @xmath139 .",
    "now , if @xmath307 is a vertex for which each neighbor @xmath310 has been labelled with @xmath311 , associate to @xmath307 a minimal degree element @xmath312 satisfying @xmath313 continue this process until all vertices have been labelled .",
    "this gives a cohomology class associated to @xmath273 , which we will examine in more detail later .",
    "it requires some proof even to see that an element of @xmath63 can be produced by the process described .",
    "however , this algorithm , which is described in ( * ? ? ? * section 1.4 ) , not only works but in fact gives a minimal set of generators for @xmath63 as a module over @xmath70 in many cases .",
    "@xcite gives conditions for the moment graph which ensure that these cohomology classes actually generate the cohomology ring .",
    "to see how the algorithm works , first consider the function associated to @xmath273 itself by this construction .",
    "we indicate the partial order by directing the edges of the moment graph , so the edges pointing down from @xmath273 are labelled @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath79 , @xmath314 as indicated in figure [ generator picture ] .",
