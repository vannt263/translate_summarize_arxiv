    "electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , i.e. the  mechanism of generating the  @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson masses , is one of the  most important theoretical issues of the  present - day particle physics .",
    "several viable scenarios are available in the  current literature ( for a  review , see e.g. ref .  ) and it is clear that only experiments can resolve this long - standing puzzle . in this respect , we are in a  rather fortunate situation now , since the  first preliminary results from lhc experiments are already coming and we can expect some important hints to the nature of ewsb in the  horizon of one year .",
    "a  simple way of implementing the  ewsb is the  `` textbook '' higgs mechanism that leads inevitably to one or several elementary scalar bosons in the  physical spectrum .",
    "while the  obvious paradigm for such a  scheme is the  current standard model ( sm ) , there are other highly popular theories built along these lines : most notably , models involving supersymmetry have been intensely studied during the  last two decades or so , since they alleviate the  famous hierarchy problem ( i.e. that of stabilizing the  scale of the  higgs boson mass ) considered by many to be a  technical flaw of the  sm.@xcite needless to say , models with elementary scalars are most convenient from the  calculational point of view , since they are perturbatively renormalizable",
    ". it also means that the  tree - level scattering amplitudes are unitarized automatically in the  high energy limit if the  higgs particles are not too heavy.@xcite    taking into account the  hierarchy problem , a  radical alternative would be a  model with no higgs scalars at all .",
    "the  oldest example of such a  higgsless version of the  ewsb is the  technicolor and its various ramifications ( cf .",
    "ref .   for a  review ) , for which the  original conceptual paradigm is the  chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . while such a  scheme is obviously quite attractive a  priori , the  application of the  ideas of dynamical symmetry breaking in the  area of electroweak interactions runs into specific difficulties and thus remains problematic so far .    with the  advent of modern applications of the  higher - dimensional theories of  the  kaluza - klein  ( kk ) type ,",
    "new attempts to attack the  ewsb problem have been made during the  last decade and models with compact extra dimensions have thus become increasingly popular ( for a  review , see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "a  particularly attractive scenario is ewsb via a  non - trivial choice of boundary conditions . although the  underlying higher - dimensional theory is non - renormalizable , the  unitarity breakdown is postponed to the  cutoff scale of the  effective 4d theory , which is related to the  size of the  extra dimension",
    ". `` bad high energy behavior '' of scattering amplitudes is prevented by the  exchange of kk excitations rather than through elementary scalar particles .",
    "these models thus belong to the  class of higgsless theories .",
    "it is worth noting that the higher - dimensional theory can be viewed as a  limiting case of deconstructed 4d `` moose '' theory.@xcite such an approach recieved a  considerable attention including the formulation of kk equivalence theorem.@xcite although the  deconstruction formalism can successfully restore the  higher - dimensional theory , it is still quite instructive to study the formulation of the effective 4d theory from higher dimensions and the scattering of vector bosons without relying on  the  kk equivalence theorem .",
    "this approach has been already intensively studied ( see in  particular refs .  ) , but in our opinion there are still some points that need clarification , because the  results presented in the  literature so far are not sufficiently general and complete , even at the  level of simplified toy models .",
    "we consider a  pure gauge theory on flat background with one extra finite space dimension and shortly review its construction .",
    "we examine which choices of boundary conditions are allowed by the  principle of least action and the  requirement of gauge independence of scattering amplitudes in a  simple @xmath2 toy model .",
    "we demonstrate that all of the  allowed choices lead to the  theory with scattering amplitudes that do not exhibit power - like growth in the  high energy limit . in this way ,",
    "previous results of other authors are extended and generalized .",
    "we start with the  5d yang - mills lagrangian on flat background , where the  extra space dimension is restricted to a  finite interval , conventionally denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "this may be written as @xmath4    the @xmath5 part contains a  quadratic term mixing fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but we can eliminate it by adding a  suitable gauge fixing term to the  lagrangian . since the  compactification procedure generally breaks 5d lorentz invariance , we do not need to limit ourselves to 5d invariant gauge fixing terms@xcite and are free to choose @xmath8    such a  term is still invariant under the  usual 4d lorentz transformations and exactly cancels the  cross term . furthermore , after the  kk expansion , which we perform later in the  section  [ sec : effective - lagrangian ] , the  part independent of @xmath7 agrees with the  usual lorenz - type gauge fixing term for each kk mode of @xmath6 and the  propagators of vector modes have a  form known from r@xmath9 gauge of the  standard model .",
    "the  unitary gauge is given by the  limit @xmath10 .",
    "all massive scalar modes are unphysical ; they are eliminated in the  unitary gauge , playing a  similar role as the  would - be goldstone bosons in the  standard model .",
    "when using the  variational principle of least action , we have to keep the  boundary terms coming from the  integration by parts in the  direction of the  extra space dimension",
    ". remember that it has a  finite length , so there is no reason to assume a  priori that the  fields ( or their variations ) vanish at the  endpoints of the  interval .",
    "one thus gets @xmath11 - \\int { \\textrm d}^4 x \\big [ f^{a 5 \\nu } \\delta a^a_\\nu \\big]_0^{\\pi r } \\,\\text{,}\\\\    \\delta s_\\text{g.f . } = { } & \\int { \\textrm d}^4 x \\int_0^{\\pi r } { \\textrm d}y \\ , \\bigg[\\left ( \\frac 1 \\xi \\partial^\\nu\\partial^\\mu a^a_\\mu - \\partial^\\nu\\partial_5 a_5^a \\right ) \\delta a^a_\\nu + { } \\notag\\\\    & { } + \\left ( \\xi \\partial_5\\partial_5 a_5^a - \\partial_5 \\partial^\\mu a^a_\\mu",
    "\\right ) \\delta a_5^a \\bigg ] + \\int { \\textrm d}^4 x \\left [ \\left ( \\partial^\\mu a^a_\\mu - \\xi \\partial_5 a_5^a \\right ) \\delta a_5^a",
    "\\right]_0^{\\pi r } \\,\\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus have the  equations of motion plus some consistency conditions on the  fields at the  endpoints @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "whatever boundary conditions we impose on the  gauge fields , we obviously need to ensure that the  two boundary terms vanish , i.e.    [ eq : bc - restrict1]@xmath14_0^{\\pi r } = { } & 0 \\,\\text{,}{\\label{eq : bc1}}\\\\    \\left [ \\left ( \\partial^\\mu a^a_\\mu - \\xi \\partial_5 a_5^a \\right ) \\delta a_5^a",
    "\\right]_0^{\\pi r } = { } & 0 \\,\\text{.}{\\label{eq : bc2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there are many possibilities how to satisfy ( [ eq : bc - restrict1 ] ) .",
    "the  least complicated way is to ensure that the  expressions vanish for every gauge field at each boundary separately , in other words require that the  variation itself or its coefficient is zero .",
    "assuming that we impose the  same boundary conditions for all colors of gauge fields ( but we can impose different conditions at each endpoint of the  interval ) , we have three general choices of boundary conditions , namely    [ eq : bc]@xmath15    the  last option simply means requiring that the  variations vanish ( @xmath16 ) at the  boundary .",
    "later on we show that this choice leads to the  theory with @xmath17-dependent scattering amplitudes , thus we will omit this option from our discussion for the  moment .    before proceeding with our examination of possible boundary conditions ,",
    "we make several assumptions to simplify the  problem a  little :    the  gauge group is @xmath2 .",
    "since we want to construct two charged bosons @xmath18 with the  same masses , we will always impose the  same boundary conditions on the  fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we consider only the  dirichlet ( @xmath21 ) and neumann ( @xmath22 ) boundary conditions , thus we assume that all constants in ( [ eq : bc ] ) are zero .    when reading ref .  , one could easily get an  impression that we can impose an  arbitrary combination of those boundary conditions at each endpoint of the  interval and for each color of gauge fields .",
    "this is not quite true , because the  expression ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) mixes fields of different colors , so when imposing different boundary conditions on different colors of gauge fields , we need to be sure that this term still vanishes .",
    "the  above simplification leaves us with 16 different combinations of boundary conditions   two boundaries @xmath23 two possible boundary conditions for each of two types of bosons , but seven ( almost a  half ) of them do not satisfy the  condition ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) .",
    "those are the  cases with the  condition ( [ eq : bc - nd ] ) for @xmath24 and ( [ eq : bc - dn ] ) for @xmath25 at the  same endpoint of the  interval . as an  explicite example",
    "let us write down the  expression ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) for the  color @xmath26 : @xmath27 \\delta a^1_\\nu = { \\mathsl{g}^{}_{5 } } a^3_5 a^{2 \\nu } \\delta a^1_\\nu \\neq 0\\ ] ]",
    "to get the  effective 4d fields one can use the  kk expansion , i.e. decompose all fields into an  infinite series of eigenfunctions @xmath28 of the  operator @xmath29 .",
    "the  decomposition of the  vector field @xmath30 is then given by @xmath31 and the  @xmath28 is then called the  wave function ( in the  extra dimension ) of the  mode @xmath32 .",
    "similar decomposition can be done for scalar fields @xmath7 with a  different set of the  wave functions due to the  different boundary conditions .    as long as the  imposed",
    "boundary conditions keep the  operator @xmath29 hermitian with respect to the  scalar product @xmath33 , we are guaranteed that its eigenfunctions satisfying @xmath34 form a  complete orthonormal basis . in this basis each mode @xmath35 of the  infinite kk tower obeys 4d equation of motion @xmath36 , thus it is effectively 4d vector boson with mass @xmath37 .",
    "we get the  effective 4d lagrangian by means of a  simple integration over the  extra space dimension . the  result . ]",
    "can be split into several parts : @xmath38    [ eq : l4d1]@xmath39    the  result contains the  free field lagrangian for the  infinite tower of vector and scalar fields   each vector mode has the  lorenz - type gauge fixing term and clearly all scalars are unphysical and are eliminated in the  unitary gauge ( except if there is a  massless mode ) .",
    "further , there is an  interaction of vector bosons only , which has a  well known yang - mills structure and an  interaction that involves at least one scalar particle in every vertex .",
    "all the  effective 4d couplings @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are defined by an  integral of wave functions . in our analysis",
    "we will need only three of them , explicitly    [ eq : couplings]@xmath45",
    "we require that the  scattering amplitude of process @xmath46 does not depend on  the  gauge parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the  gauge parameter is present only in the  part of vector propagator that is proportional to @xmath47 and the  mass of a  scalar field ( thus also in its propagator ) , so the  only relevant ( lowest order ) diagrams are the  @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 channel exchange of a  scalar or vector particle .",
    "the  gauge dependent terms must cancel out in each channel separately . let us take a  look at e.g. the  @xmath48 channel : @xmath51 \\left[\\epsilon(p ) \\cdot \\epsilon(r)\\right ] + \\dots \\,\\text { , } { \\label{eq : r - vector}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52 \\left[\\epsilon(p ) \\cdot \\epsilon(r)\\right ] \\,\\text{.}\\ ] ] in order to have any chance of cancellation between the  corresponding modes of exchanged vector and scalar particles , we obviously need @xmath53 .",
    "this means that we need to impose either the  same boundary conditions on @xmath7 as on @xmath6 , or the  opposite boundary conditions ( meaning every dirichlet condition imposed on a  vector field implies the  neumann condition on the  scalar field of the  same color at the  same boundary and vice versa ) .",
    "one can easily check that the  gauge dependent parts cancel out , if the  couplings and masses satisfy the  relation @xmath54 which can be recast in terms of the  integrals of wave functions as follows @xmath55    let us examine the  relation between the  wave functions @xmath56 of the  vector modes and @xmath57 of the  scalar modes .",
    "if we use the  boundary condition ( [ eq : bc - dd ] ) , then the  functions are the  same and obviously we can not get gauge independent scattering amplitudes .",
    "the  same conclusion was also reached in ref .   using a  different line of argumentation , based on the  requirement of",
    "consistently defined restricted class of 5d gauge transformations . on the  other hand ,",
    "if we use an  arbitrary combination of boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc - dn ] ) and ( [ eq : bc - nd ] ) , then one of the  functions is sine and the  other cosine with the  same arguments , and the  relation for every massive mode of color @xmath58 reads @xmath59",
    ".    there could still be a  problem coming from massless modes , but since we have already established that the  only consistent boundary conditions are ( [ eq : bc - dn ] ) and ( [ eq : bc - nd ] ) , there can be only a  massless scalar , or a  massless vector particle , but not both of the  same color .",
    "the  massless scalar is not a  problem , because the  gauge parameter is present only in the  term @xmath60 . for a  massless vector boson ,",
    "the  relevant term is proportional to the  expression ( [ eq : couplings - gg ] ) , which contains @xmath61 under both integrals .",
    "since the  wave function of a  massless mode is a  simple constant , this term does not contribute to the  scattering amplitude at all .",
    "the  conclusion of this section is that we can impose an  arbitrary combination of boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc - dn ] ) and ( [ eq : bc - nd ] ) on the  gauge fields as long as it satisfies ( [ eq : bc - restrict1 ] ) .",
    "this fact allows us to pass to the  unitary gauge , which simplifies significantly further calculations .",
    "let us now calculate the  energy dependence of the  invariant matrix element for the  ( generally inelastic ) scattering of gauge bosons without any assumptions regarding the  color or the  kk mode number of the  gauge bosons in the  initial or final state .",
    "we consider the  high energy limit and expand all quantities in powers of energy ( more precisely in the  powers of mandelstam invariant @xmath48 ) keeping only the  divergent parts , and show that they indeed cancel out automatically without introducing an  additional higgs field .",
    "we do not employ a  hard cutoff on the  spectrum of the  kk modes and keep the  whole infinite towers of the  kk excitations .",
    "this is justified due to the  fact that the  contributions from the  highest kk modes are suppressed in the  high energy limit ( for a  detailed discussion see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the  lowest order diagrams for this process involve the  direct four - boson interaction , the  @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 channel exchange of kk vector excitations and possibly the  exchange of massless scalar in all channels as well .",
    "we carry out the  calculation in the  center of mass reference frame .",
    "let us denote the  scattering angle by @xmath63 and for the  sake of simplicity introduce a  shorthand notation @xmath64 .",
    "the  energy expansion of the  contribution of the  contact four - boson interaction is given by @xmath65 + { } \\notag\\\\    & + \\left(\\frac s 4\\right)^{\\phantom{2 } } \\frac{4\\overline m^2 { { \\mathsl{g}^{2}_{\\pmb{abcd}}}}}{m_{\\pmb a } m_{\\pmb b } m_{\\pmb c } m_{\\pmb d } } \\bigg [ f^{eab}f^{ecd } ( -\\cos\\theta ) + { } \\notag\\\\    & + f^{eac}f^{ebd } \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{2 } + f^{ead}f^{ebc } \\frac{1 + \\cos\\theta}{2 } \\bigg ] + { \\mathcal o(1)}\\,\\text{. } { \\label{eq:4v}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the  contributions of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 channel exchange of kk vector excitations are infinite sums over all kk modes group the  color @xmath58 of exchanged gauge boson is fixed by the  colors of the  bosons in the  initial and final state , thus we actually sum only over the  kk index  @xmath66 . ] , which may be massive as well as massless .",
    "thus , with regard to the  different form of vector propagator for massive and massless modes , it is convenient to split them in two parts , namely @xmath67 and @xmath68 , corresponding to the  longitudinal ( @xmath69 ) and the  diagonal ( @xmath70 ) parts of the  propagator respectively . since the  @xmath49 and @xmath50 channels differ only in the  simultaneous exchange of indices @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and sign change of @xmath73 , from now on we will explicitly display only the  results for the  @xmath48 and @xmath49 channel .",
    "terms corresponding to the  longitudinal part of boson propagator can be expanded in the  powers of energy as follows :    [ eq : st - qq]@xmath74    similarly , after quite a  long calculation , one gets the  terms corresponding to the  diagonal part of boson propagator in the  form    [ eq : st - diag]@xmath75 + { \\mathcal o(1)}\\,\\text{,}\\\\    { \\mathcal{m}}^{\\text{(}t\\text{)}}_\\text{(diag ) } & = \\sum_{k \\geq 0 } \\frac{{{\\mathsl{g}^{}_{\\pmb{eac}}}}{{\\mathsl{g}^{}_{\\pmb{ebd } } } } f^{eac}f^{ebd}}{m_{\\pmb a } m_{\\pmb b } m_{\\pmb c } m_{\\pmb d } } \\bigg [ \\left(\\frac s 4 \\right)^2 ( 3 - 2\\cos\\theta - \\cos^2\\theta ) + { } \\notag\\\\    & \\qquad\\quad { } + \\left(\\frac s 4\\right ) \\big(-m_{\\pmb e}^2 \\,\\frac{3 + \\cos\\theta}{2 } + 8\\overline m^2 \\cos\\theta \\big)\\bigg ] + { \\mathcal o(1)}\\,\\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the  only scalar mode that can be present in the  theory is massless and the  corresponding contributions to the  invariant matrix elements read    [ eq : st - scalar]@xmath76    owing to the  relation ( [ eq : couplings - gg - ee ] ) for all massive modes ( @xmath77 ) of color @xmath58 these terms give us in combination with @xmath67 the  sum over the  complete orthonormal set of functions @xmath78 in each channel .",
    "it is a  matter of simple exercise to derive the  sum rule @xmath79 which implies that terms growing as the  fourth power of energy in the  @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 channel contributions ( [ eq : st - diag ] ) cancel against the  terms from ( [ eq:4v ] ) corresponding to the  contact four - boson interaction .",
    "let us present some additional sum rules that are valid for all the  remaining consistent boundary conditions .",
    "the  combination of contributions ( [ eq : st - qq ] ) and ( [ eq : st - scalar ] ) gives rise to the  sum of terms containing two couplings of the  type @xmath80 .",
    "the  index of kk mode is present only through these couplings , thus we can write down the  first sum rule @xmath81    the  second type of sum contains the  kk index not only in the  couplings , but also in the  mass of the  exchanged vector mode , explicitly @xmath82    in order to get all terms of the  invariant matrix element in a  similar form , we need one more formula , which follows directly from the  relation between wave functions and masses ( [ eq : eigenfunctions ] ) and the  coupling definition ( [ eq : couplings-4v ] ) : @xmath83 \\,\\text{.}\\ ] ]    now we gather all the  remaining divergent terms from the  contact four - boson interaction ( [ eq:4v ] ) and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 channel exchange of vector and scalar modes ( [ eq : st - qq ] ) , ( [ eq : st - diag ] ) and ( [ eq : st - scalar ] ) , employ the  derived sum rules and the  relation ( [ eq : g4-int ] ) . interestingly enough , the  resulting invariant matrix element for the  process in question then takes on quite a  simple form @xmath84    the  whole divergent part of the  matrix element is proportional to the  expression @xmath85 .",
    "however , this is zero due to the  familiar jacobi identity .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath86 scattering amplitude of longitudinal gauge bosons contains no terms growing indefinitely with the  energy .",
    "we have shown this fact without any assumptions regarding the  colors or the  kk mode numbers of the  gauge bosons in the  initial and final state .",
    "note that the  elastic scattering of two identical longitudinal vector modes studied in ref .   is a  special case contained in our general formulae .",
    "since all the  gauge fields satisfy the  same boundary conditions , the  masses and wave functions ( thus , couplings as well ) are color - insensitive and are uniquely identified by their kk indices .",
    "this implies that there is no contribution from ( [ eq : st - qq ] ) and ( [ eq : st - scalar ] ) to the  scattering amplitude .",
    "furthermore , in this special case it is possible to combine ( [ eq : e2-sum2 ] ) and ( [ eq : g4-int ] ) to one compact sum rule @xmath87 .",
    "we have studied the  gauge sector of a  5d toy model with ewsb triggered by a  non - trivial choice of boundary conditions in the  fifth dimension .",
    "this class of models has already been intensively studied in the  literature , but many authors prefer a  more traditional approach to the  extra dimensions known as _ orbifolding _   one starts with an  infinite extra dimension and compactifies it by a  set of identifications ( most commonly to @xmath88 orbifold ) ; such a  procedure then implies certain boundary conditions for the  fields .",
    "another already studied possibility that we have also chosen in this work , is the  interval approach , where one starts straight away with a  finite space interval and then figures out , what the  consistent boundary conditions are .",
    "we have derived the  set of consistent boundary conditions for a  simple model with @xmath2 gauge symmetry solely from the  principle of least action and the  requirement of gauge independence of scattering amplitudes .",
    "any choice belonging to this set leads to the  theory with well - behaved scattering amplitudes of longitudinal vector bosons , i.e. all terms growing as positive power of energy cancel out .",
    "this was explicitly demonstrated on a  general @xmath86 scattering process without any assumptions regarding the  colors or kk mode numbers of the  gauge bosons in the  initial and final state ( and without relying on the kk equivalence theorem ) .",
    "previously published results of other authors ( see refs .  ) covered only certain special cases of this model ( e.g. a  special choice of boundary conditions , or the  discussion of an  elastic scattering process only ) .",
    "our present work is therefore an  improvement and generalization of these earlier results .",
