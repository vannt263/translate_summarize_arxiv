    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has uncovered strong oscillations of x - ray flux during x - ray bursts in several low mass x - ray binaries ( strohmayer et al .",
    "current interpretation favors a rotation mechanism for the burst oscillations : asymmetric nuclear burning leaves a ` hot spot ' which rotates with the neutron star and produces a strong modulation ( strohmayer et al .",
    "the frequency of the burst oscillation is then the spin frequency of the neutron star , or twice the spin frequency for two spots ( miller 1999 ) .",
    "oscillations have been discovered in x - ray bursts from the following systems : 4u 1728 - 34 ( 363 hz , strohmayer et al . 1996 ; strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) , ks  1731 - 260 ( 524 hz , smith , morgan & bradt 1996 ) , a source near the galactic center ( 589 hz , strohmayer , jahoda & giles 1997 ) , aql x-1 ( 549 hz , zhang et al . 1998 ) , 4u 1636 - 536 ( 581/290 hz , strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 , miller 1999 ) , and 4u 1702 - 429 ( 330 hz , markwardt , strohmayer & swank 1999 ) .",
    "the observed frequencies are close to the 401 hz spin frequency of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , further strengthening the identification of these frequencies with the neutron star spin .",
    "the detailed energy dependence of these burst oscillations is one avenue that remains to be explored . here",
    "i show that the low energy photons in a burst oscillation from aql x-1 lag the high energy photons by roughly 15% of the oscillation period .",
    "lags of the same sign and similar magnitudes have also been detected in other fast signals from low mass x - ray binaries : the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations , qpos ( vaughan et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , kaaret et al . 1999 ) and the sax j1808.4 - 3658 pulsed emission ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) .",
    "a simple mechanism of doppler shifted emission may explain these lags .",
    "strong doppler effects are expected to be important since the fast spin rates imply high speeds ( @xmath1 ) . as a hot spot on",
    "the spinning neutron star approaches the observer ( at early phases ) the emission is doppler boosted and blue shifted , as it recedes ( at later phases ) the emission is deboosted and red shifted . at early phases the spectra are also attenuated due to the smaller projected area .",
    "the result is that low energy photons are preferentially emitted after the high energy photons .",
    "a quantitative test of this doppler delay scenario matches the observed low energy lags in aql  x-1 well .",
    "the possibility of doppler effects and the fact that they may manifest in pulse phase spectroscopy has been noted before by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in the next section",
    "i present the measurement of the lag in the x - ray burst from aql x-1 . in section  3",
    "i describe a simple model for the relativistic effects and compare the predicted delays to those observed .",
    "section  4 discusses these results in a broader context .",
    "for this analysis i consider the x - ray burst from aql  x-1 starting 1 1997 march 1 23:27:40 utc ( see zhang et al . 1998 for a report of this burst ) .",
    "i use data from the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) in an ` event ' mode with high time resolution ( 122@xmath2sec ) and high energy resolution ( 64 channels ) .",
    "a section of the lightcurve is shown in figure  1 ( top ) .",
    "there are gaps in the event mode data since the required telemetry rate is high . within the 4 second time window shown in figure  1 ( top ) ,",
    "the power density spectrum for all the channels shows a strong oscillation at 549.7 hz ( figure  1 , bottom ) . in the following",
    "i calculate fourier transforms within this time window .",
    "phase delays in a signal between two energy bands are quantified by means of cross spectral analysis ( van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ; for more information see vaughan et al . 1994 ; nowak et al .",
    "the cross spectrum is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the measured complex fourier coefficients for the two energy bands at a frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the phase lag between the signals in the two bands is given by the argument of @xmath6 ( its position angle in the complex plane ) .",
    "the error in the phase lag is calculated here from the coherence function uncorrected for counting statistics ( nowak et al .",
    "the cross correlation code used here has been employed to calculate phase lags in black hole candidates ( ford et al .",
    "1999 ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 and kilohertz qpos and matches the results reported in the literature .",
    "figure  2 shows the resulting phase lags from the cross spectra of the 4 seconds of data described above .",
    "negative numbers indicate that the oscillations in the low energy band ( 3.55.7 kev ) lag those in the higher energy bands .",
    "the lags are calculated by averaging the signal in the range 549.6550.1 hz .",
    "the delays in each band up to 30 kev ( where background dominates ) are 3@xmath7 significant .",
    "the delay between 3.55.7 kev and the entire 5.743.6 kev band is @xmath8 rad , 5@xmath7 significant .",
    "deadtime effects can in principle affect the measured phase lag .",
    "the data considered here are in the tail of the burst ( rate of 9280 c / s , full energy band ) where deadtime is less important .",
    "one method of correcting for deadtime is to subtract a cross vector averaged over high frequencies where no correlation is expected ( van der klis et al .",
    "employing this correction does not change the values measured here .    due to the data",
    "gaps it is not possible to perform cross correlations on long stretches of data earlier in the burst .",
    "cross correlations on 0.5 sec intervals of data earlier in the burst return large errors on phase delays with inconclusive results .",
    "as a simple model for the lags i consider discrete hot spots on the surface of the rotating neutron star . the rest frame emission of the clump is a blackbody .",
    "the observed spectrum at frequency @xmath9 at spin phase @xmath10 is : @xmath11 ^ 3\\ ] ] @xmath12^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lorentz factor , @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 the rest frame temperature ) , @xmath2 is the sine of the angle between the spin axis and the line of sight , and @xmath17 is a normalization . the above formula is a relativistic transformation of the blackbody which shifts @xmath18 and modifies the normalization such that @xmath19 is conserved ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the @xmath20 term is an area projection factor , with @xmath21 the angle between the normal and line of sight in the rest frame ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the phase angle , @xmath10 , is defined such that phase zero is with the spot approaching the observer directly .",
    "the spots are considered small and isotropically emitting in the rest frame .",
    "i take @xmath16=1 kev , @xmath23 .",
    "these are values appropriate for the neutron star ; a more exact value of @xmath16 is in principle possible from the spectral fits but this depends on the fraction of the surface contributing to the modulated hot spot emission .",
    "a more exact value of @xmath24 depends on the neutron star radius .",
    "i also take @xmath25 , i.e. a line of sight through the equator .",
    "the spin frequency is 275 hz and two antipodal hot spots produce an oscillation at 550 hz .",
    "such a geometry , where the @xmath26550 hz signal is a harmonic of the spin , is suggested by recent results on other burst oscillations ( miller 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are blackbodies whose temperature shifts by 10% over the period . averaged over phase , the spectrum is approximately blackbody in shape with @xmath18 within 1% of the input @xmath16 .",
    "the spectra as a function of @xmath10 , folded through the rxte response matrix , yield lightcurves of count rates in various energy bands . from these lightcurves",
    "i calculate the phase lag in the 550 hz signal with the fft and cross - correlation programs used in the measurements above .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown with the data in figure  2 .",
    "there are no free parameters , only the assumptions taken above .",
    "the calculated lags will decrease if @xmath16 is increased or @xmath24 is decreased .",
    "the smaller delay for higher @xmath16 happens since the peak of the lightcurves comes later in phase for higher energy photons , corresponding to a smaller delay between high and low energy photons .",
    "observing at higher inclinations ( decreased @xmath2 ) will also decrease the lag .",
    "the lightcurves that yield these predicted lags generally have maxima at earlier phases for higher energies and are more sharply peaked in shape at higher energies .",
    "this simple model neglects general relativistic effects ( e.g. strohmayer 1992 , miller & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "two main factors from gr will effect the observed light curves .",
    "gravitational bending makes the spots observable at @xmath27 or @xmath28 , stretching the pulse .",
    "light travel time delays , longer for more extreme bending , will also shift the pulse .",
    "these effects depend on the compactness of the star .",
    "given the quality of the present data , a more detailed treatment including these effects is not justified .",
    "an overall gravitational redshift also means that @xmath18 in the local frame is higher , as in x - ray burst spectral models .",
    "the previous sections show that low energy photons lag high energy photons in the oscillation signal of an x - ray burst from aql x-1 .",
    "the sign and magnitude of the lags are in agreement with the simple model considered in section  3 of two hot spots on the neutron star producing a doppler boosted and shifted spectra as the star rotates .",
    "this doppler delay mechanism for producing low energy lags may describe not only the lags in the x - ray burst oscillations but also the lags in the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) and the ( lower frequency ) kilohertz qpos ( vaughan et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; kaaret et al .",
    "both show a lag of low energy photons relative to high energy photons with magnitudes of roughly @xmath26100 @xmath2sec ( @xmath29 rad ) for sax j1808.4 - 3658 and @xmath2630 @xmath2sec ( @xmath30 rad ) for the kilohertz qpos in similar energy bands to those considered here .",
    "some models link the frequency of the kilohertz qpos to a keplerian motion in the disk ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 , stella & vietri 1999 ; but see titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "if any of the kilohertz qpos is a result of keplerian motion , one might expect a soft lag due to doppler delays .",
    "such lags have been observed in what is likely the lower frequency of the two qpos .",
    "doppler delays are an alternative to previous mechanisms invoked to produce lags .",
    "comptonization has been one process used to explain low energy lags in sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) .",
    "low energy lags are produced if high energy photons are injected into a relatively cool comptonizing cloud .",
    "this is the opposite of the situation normally considered : comptonization by a hot cloud in the same region .",
    "a hot cloud produces a lag of high energy photons , as shown quantitatively for fast signals by lee & miller ( 1998 ) .",
    "another mechanism suggested for low energy delays is an extended , cooling hot spot with lower energy photons from the outer regions ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) .",
    "more measurements of phase lags in x - ray burst oscillations are clearly needed , in particular in the @xmath26350 hz oscillations which are likely from single spots .",
    "improved statistics will also yield a better test of the predicted energy dependence of the lags .",
