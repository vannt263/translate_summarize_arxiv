    "supernova ( sn ) 1987a occurred in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "it has been extensively studied in all wavelengths from radio to @xmath1-ray .",
    "the initial short outburst of radio emission @xcite is attributed to the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated by the sn shock propagated in the free wind of presupernova star , which was the blue supergiant ( bsg ) @xcite .",
    "after about 3 years radio emission was detected again @xcite as well as the monotonically increased x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "this second increase of emission is attributed to the entrance of the outer sn shock into the thermalized bsg wind and then in the h  ii region occupied by much more dense matter , consists of the swept up wind of red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitor star @xcite .    to describe the observed properties of nonthermal emission of sn  1987a we use here a nonlinear kinetic theory .",
    "it couples the particle acceleration process with the hydrodynamics of the thermal gas @xcite .",
    "therefore in spherically symmetric approach it is able to quite definitely predict the evolution of gas density , pressure , mass velocity , together with the energy spectrum and the spatial distribution of cosmic ray ( cr ) nuclei and electrons at any given evolutionary epoch @xmath4 , and the properties of the nonthermal radiation produced in snrs due to these accelerated crs .",
    "the application of this theory to individual snrs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) has provided the explanation of the observed snr properties under the assumption of strong interior magnetic field .",
    "it was also shown that this strong field leads to the concentration of the highest - energy electrons in a very thin shell just behind the shock .",
    "recent observations with the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray telescopes in space make it possible to resolve such filamentary structures , which are the result of strong synchrotron losses of the emitting multi - tev electrons in strong magnetic fields downstream of the outer sn shock @xcite .",
    "application of the nonlinear theory to sn  1987a @xcite explained the properties of the observed radioemission .",
    "it predicted also the continuous increase of radioemission with roughly constant rate during the period from 1999 to 2006 yr , which was confirmed by further measurements @xcite .",
    "we analyze here radio data for more extended period of observation @xcite together with the chandra measurements of x - ray emission @xcite which provides a strong constraint on the amount of the nonthermal synchrotron emission at the same energies 0.5 - 10  kev . it is demonstrated that this constrain gives the evidence of strongly enhanced ( amplified ) magnetic field inside the snr , that in turn provides a better fit of radio data than in our previous study .",
    "we use canonical values of stellar ejecta mass @xmath5 , distance @xmath6  kpc , hydrodynamic explosion energy @xmath7  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "during an initial period the shell material has a broad distribution in velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the fastest part of this ejecta distribution can be described by a power law @xmath9 .",
    "we use a value @xmath10 appropriate for sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) creates a strong shock there which heats the thermal gas and accelerates particles diffusively to a nonthermal cr component of comparable energy density .",
    "strongly nonuniform csm is a result of interaction of progenitors winds : dense slow rsg wind and subsequent fast and diluted bsg wind . during initial period after the explosion the sn shock propagated in the free bsg wind and reached after about a day @xmath11 the termination shock in bsg wind , situated at the radial distance @xmath12  cm @xcite .",
    "after that the sn shock propagates in the thermalized bsg wind of density @xmath13",
    ". considerable rapid decrease of the sn shock speed occurred during the days @xmath14 @xcite showed that sn shock entered the h  ii region of density @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we model the csm density distribution at distances @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18  cm is the contact discontinuity between two winds , @xmath19 is the scale of the smooth transition between them .",
    "the analysis of the rapidly increasing x - ray emission provides the evidence that h  ii region in turn is not uniform : at day @xmath20 the sn shock begins to interact with the dense inner ring .",
    "its radial behavior can be represented in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22  cm , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "such a gas radial profile is close to what was extracted from the above analysis @xcite .",
    "we adopt here for the gas number density @xmath25 the following values : @xmath26  @xmath27 , @xmath28  @xmath27 and @xmath29  @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the mass of proton .",
    "the value @xmath28",
    "@xmath27 which is by a factor of 1.5 lower than was used in our previous study @xcite , provides a good compromise between the sn shock dynamics seen in radio and in x - ray emissions ( see below ) .",
    "note , that the actual structure of the h  ii region , especially the dense inner ring , is essentially nonspherically symmetric .",
    "nevertheless since our spherically symmetric theory reproduces the sn shock evolution @xmath31 consistent with the existing data , one can expect that it gives a good estimate for the production of crs and their subsequent nonthermal emission .",
    "a rather high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath32  mg is needed to reproduce the observed steep radio spectrum @xcite .",
    "we believe that the required strength of the magnetic field have to be attributed to nonlinear field amplification at the sn shock by cr acceleration itself . according to plasma physical considerations @xcite , the existing csm magnetic field",
    "can indeed be significantly amplified at a strong shock by cr streaming instabilities .",
    "in fact , for all the thoroughly studied young snrs , the ratio of magnetic field energy density @xmath33 in the upstream region of the shock precursor to the cr pressure @xmath34 is about the same @xcite . here",
    "@xmath35 is the far upstream field presumably amplified by crs of highest energy , @xmath36 is the total shock compression ratio . within an error of about 50 percent we have @xmath37 cr pressure in young snrs",
    "has a typical value @xmath38 , therefore we adopt here upstream magnetic field @xmath39 since the process of magnetic field amplification is not included in our theory we simply postulate the existence of far upstream field @xmath40 given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "the spectrum of crs produced by strong modified shock is very hard so that crs with highest energies have a largest contribution in their energy content .",
    "these the most energetic crs produce field amplification on their spacial scale that is the precursor size .",
    "therefore crs with lower energies already see the amplified field @xmath40 .",
    "we will argue that such a high field , that is by a factor of ten larger than used in our previous study @xcite , is indeed required to fit the x - ray data .",
    "it also gives a better fit of radio data .",
    "we start our consideration from the snr evolutionary epoch @xmath41  d , when the outer sn shock has a radius @xmath42 and speed @xmath43  km / s .",
    "these values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 according to our calculations @xcite correspond to the end of sn shock propagation in the free bsg wind region @xmath46 .",
    "we neglect the contribution of crs accelerated in the region @xmath46 , because due to a high gas density the number of crs produced in the region @xmath16 very soon becomes dominant .",
    "calculated shock radius @xmath44 and speed @xmath45 shown in fig.[f1]a as a function of time are in satisfactory agreement with the values obtained on the basis of radio and x - ray measurements .",
    "note that radio data compared with x - ray data gives larger shock size at any given time @xmath4 and calculated radius @xmath31 goes between these two sets    to fit the spectral shape of the observed radio emission we assume a proton injection rate @xmath47 , which is a fraction of gas particles involved into the acceleration at the from of sn shock .",
    "this leads to a significant nonlinear modification of the shock : as it is seen in fig.[f1]b total shock compression ratio @xmath48 is essentially larger and a subshock compression ratio @xmath49 is lower than classical value 4 .    since the sn  1987a is very young crs despite of very efficient acceleration",
    "accumulated only 7% of the explosion energy @xmath50 ( see fig.[f1]c ) .",
    "note that the injection is expected to be strongly suppressed at the quasiperpendicular part of the shock , therefore one should renormalize the results for the nucleonic spectrum , calculated within the spherically symmetric model .",
    "the lack of symmetry in the actual snr can be approximately taken into account by a renormalization factor @xmath51 , which diminishes the nucleonic cr production efficiency , calculated in the spherical model , and all effects associated with it ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . with this renormalization",
    "the crs inside sn  1987a already contain @xmath52 since during the last 15  yrs the shock speed and the gas density are almost constant cr energy content grows roughly linearly with time .",
    "it gives the natural explanation of the linear increase of the radio emission detected during this evolutionary period .",
    "strongly modified sn shock generates cr spectrum @xmath53 , which is very steep at momenta @xmath54 , with index @xmath55 .",
    "cr electrons with such a spectrum produces synchrotron radioemission spectrum @xmath56 with spectral index @xmath57 , that very well corresponds to the experiment , as it is seen in fig.[f2 ] , where we present synchrotron energy spectra @xmath58 , calculated for five subsequent epoch together with the experimental data .",
    "note that cr spectrum has a concave shape : it becomes flatter at higher momenta @xmath59 . as a consequence synchrotron spectrum @xmath60",
    "is also concave as it is clearly seen in fig.[f2 ] at @xmath61  hz .",
    "radio data reveal this property in good consistency with theoretical prediction .    strong downstream magnetic field @xmath62  mg , that corresponds to the upstream field @xmath63  mg ( see fig.[f1 ] ) , provides synchrotron cooling of electrons with momenta @xmath64 that in turn makes synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies @xmath65  hz very steep ( see fig.[f2 ] ) . concave shape of electrons continuously produced at the shock front together with their synchrotron cooling lead to a formation of two peaks in synchrotron energy spectrum @xmath58 .",
    "the first one at @xmath66  hz corresponds to cr electron momentum @xmath67 above which synchrotron energy looses are relevant , whereas the second peak at @xmath68  hz corresponds to the maximum momentum @xmath69 of accelerated electrons . under this condition calculated synchrotron flux at frequency @xmath70  hz , which corresponds to the photon energy @xmath71  kev ,",
    "is below the measured flux at the epochs @xmath72  d. since the contribution of the nonthermal radiation in the observed x - ray emission of sn  1987a is not very well known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed x - ray flux has to be considered as the upper limit for the expected nonthermal emission . at early epoch @xmath73",
    "d however the calculated flux exceeds the measured one ( see the curve , corresponding @xmath74  d in fig.[f2 ] ) .",
    "this can be considered as indication , that the actual magnetic field @xmath40 is few times larger then given by the eq.(3 ) .",
    "to illustrate the situation expected at considerably lower magnetic field we present in fig.[f3 ] synchrotron energy spectra calculated at the same set of parameters as before except magnetic field , which was taken @xmath75  @xmath76 g independent of time .",
    "since the interior magnetic field @xmath77  mg ( @xmath78 ) is essentially lower in this case , synchrotron losses of high energy cr electrons are considerably smaller compared with the previous case .",
    "due to this fact synchrotron spectra considerably exceeds at any given epoch the measured chandra flux .",
    "therefore we can conclude , that the actual interior magnetic field strength is not lower than @xmath79  mg .",
    "projected radial profile of the nonthermal x - ray emission at high interior magnetic field @xmath80  mg is characterized by an extremely sharp peak of thickness @xmath81 just behind the sn shock . since the thermal x - rays have much wider radial distribution it provides the possibility for experimental determination of the nonthermal x - ray contribution in the observed emission .",
    "experimental determination of the x - ray spectrum at @xmath82  hz ( @xmath83  kev ) is the another possibility to discriminate the nonthermal emission .",
    "such kind of measurements can be done with space instrument suzaku .",
    "completely different possibility to have the synchrotron flux , which fit the radio data and goes below chandra data , is low field scenario , when the magnetic field is as low as @xmath84  @xmath76 g . in such a case",
    "the cutoff frequency of synchrotron spectrum @xmath85 is lower than @xmath86  hz and calculated fluxes go down exponentially at @xmath87 below chandra points .",
    "however the value @xmath84",
    "@xmath76 g is unrealistically small for such a dense medium , which we have in sn  1987a .",
    "in addition the effective energy of electrons @xmath88 which radiate at @xmath89  ghz in the interior field @xmath80  @xmath76 g is about 5  gev .",
    "the electron spectrum at gev - energies is characterized by a power low index @xmath90 that is considerably smaller than what is required for the observed radio spectrum . note that as it is seen in fig.[f3 ] even the field @xmath91  mg is too small to have a good fit of radio data as in fig.[f2 ] . therefore low field scenario should be rejected .",
    "calculated @xmath1-ray integral flux shown in fig.[f4 ] at all energies is dominated by the @xmath92-decay component .",
    "since the sn shock is strongly modified @xmath1-ray spectrum at energies @xmath93  tev is very hard : @xmath94 . at the current epoch",
    "the expected @xmath1-ray energy flux at tev - energies is about @xmath95  erg/(@xmath3s ) and during the next four years it expect to grow by a factor of two .",
    "this flux is by a factor of five lower compared with our previous prediction @xcite , because we use here renormalization factor @xmath96 , which reduces the number of accelerated crs calculated within spherically symmetric approach .",
    "the existence of strongly asymmetric csm structure , which is dense inner ring , makes our prediction of @xmath1-ray flux uncertain .",
    "according to the rough estimate this uncertainty is not very large , about a factor of two , due to the stronger sn shock deceleration in denser medium . at the moment",
    "there are only upper limits of tev emission obtained by cangaroo @xcite and hess @xcite instruments ( see fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "the kinetic nonlinear model for cr acceleration in snrs has been in detail applied to sn  1987a , in order to compare its results with observational properties.we find that quite a reasonable consistency with most of the observational data can be achieved .",
    "the evidence of the efficient cr production leading to a strong shock modification comes from radio data .",
    "significant shock modification leads to the steep and concave cr spectrum which very well fits the observed radioemission spectrum , under the condition of extremely high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath32  mg . to be consistent also with the chandra measurements of the x - ray flux , which has to be considered as an upper limit for the nonthermal x - ray emission , even larger interior field",
    "@xmath0  mg is needed .",
    "such a high field provides a strong synchrotron losses of cr electrons emitting nonthermal x - rays , that makes the high frequency part of the synchrotron spectrum much more steeper and provides a consistency with the experiment .",
    "the expected @xmath92-decay @xmath1-ray energy flux at the current epoch is about @xmath95  erg/(@xmath3  s ) at energies @xmath97  tev .",
    "therefore the detection of @xmath1-ray emission at these energies would imply clear evidence for a hadronic origin and for a strong magnetic field amplification inside sn  1987a ."
