    "the main title of this paper is , apart from the term multiplex , literally identical to a forney , gallager and co - workers paper issued more than one decade ago [ for et al .",
    "84 ] , which analyzed the benefits of coded - modulation techniques .",
    "the large success achieved by ungerboeck s coded - modulation came from the way of introducing redundancy in the encoder [ ung 82 ] . in classical channel coding ,",
    "redundant signals are appended to information symbols in a way somewhat analogous to time division multiplex tdm ( envelope interleaving ) .",
    "it was believed that introducing error - control ability would increase bandwidth .",
    "an efficient way of introducing such an ability without sacrificing rate nor requiring more bandwidth consists in adding redundancy by an alphabet expansion .",
    "this technique is particularly suitable for channel in the narrow - band region .",
    "a similar reasoning occurs in the multiplex framework where many people nowadays believe that mux must increase bandwidth requirements .",
    "+   + one of the most powerful tools in communications is the fourier transform , specially its discrete version dft . on the other side ,",
    "applications of finite field have a renewed explosion of interest in the last decades .",
    "a discrete fourier transform for finite fields ( ffft ) was introduced by pollard [ pol 71 ] .",
    "it has successfully applied to perform discrete convolution and as a tool of image processing [ ree et al .",
    "77 , ree - tru 79 ] among many other applications .",
    "besides classical ffft we are concerned with a new finite field discrete version [ cam et al .",
    "98 ] of the integral transform introduced by r.v.l .",
    "hartley [ har 42 , bri 92 ] .",
    "alike classical galois - fourier transforms [ bla 79 ] , finite field hartley transform ght [ cam et al .",
    "98 ] defined on a gaussian integer set gi(@xmath0 ) contains some redundancy and only the cyclotomic coset leaders of transform coefficients are needed to be transmitted .",
    "this yields a new * efficient - bandwidth code division multiplex for band - limited channels*. these mux may present lower bandwidth requirements than tdm by using an argument somewhat analogous to coded - modulation .",
    "tradeoffs between extension of the alphabet and bandwidth are exploited in the sequel .",
    "+   + in the present work , the coded - modulation idea is adapted to multiplex : information streaming from users are not combined by interleaving ( like tdm ) but rather by signal alphabet expansion .",
    "the mux of users sources over a galois field gf(@xmath1 ) deals with an expanded signal set having symbols from an extension field gf(@xmath0 ) , @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the multiplex of @xmath3 band limited channels of identical maximal frequency @xmath4 leads to _ bandwidth requirements less than @xmath5 _ , in contrast with tdmed or fdmed signals .",
    "+   + the design of such an _ efficient bandwidth mux _ is based upon the finite field structure , specifically , it consists of applying finite - field fourier transforms ( ffft ) .",
    "this paper shows that the bandwidth compactness factor relatively to tdm depends on the length @xmath6 , the alphabet extension .",
    "+   + another point to mention is that the superiority of digital mux regarding analogic mux is essentially due to the low complexity of tdm .",
    "the majority of today multiplex systems follows plesiocrhonous ( pdh ) or synchronous ( sdh ) hierarchy . besides presenting higher spectral efficiency ( bits / s / hz ) than classical mux",
    ", the new cdm schemes here introduced are based on fast transforms so they also seem to be attractive from the implementation viewpoint .",
    "although most mux systems today be intended to optical fiber which are not yet bandlimited channels , multiplex has also been adopted on satellite channels .",
    "probably applications of such multiplex will be on transponders and specially on cellular communications .",
    "cable television ( catv ) can also have benefit by using such a technique .",
    "digital multiplex normally alludes time division multiplex ( tdm ) .",
    "however , it also can be achieved by coding division multiplex ( cdm ) .",
    "the cdm has recently been focus of interest , specially after the is-154 standardization of the cdma system for cellular telephone . in this section",
    "we introduce a new class of mux schemes based upon finite - field transforms which can be implemented by fast transform algorithms .",
    "_ classical multiplex increases simultaneously the transmission rate and the bandwidth by the same factor _ , keeping thus the spectral efficiency unchanged . in order to achieve ( slight ) better spectral efficiencies ,",
    "classical cdma uses waveforms presenting a non zero but residual correlation .",
    "+   + given a signal @xmath7 over a finite field gf(@xmath1 ) we deal with the galois domain considering the spectrum @xmath8 over an extension field gf(@xmath0 ) which corresponds to the finite field transform ( galois transform ) [ bla 79 , cam et al .",
    "+   + as an alternative and attractive implementation , the multiplex is carried out by a finite field transform ( ffft / ffht ) and the demux corresponds exactly to a inverse finite - field transform of length @xmath9 .",
    "each symbol on the ground field gf(@xmath1 ) have duration @xmath10 seconds .",
    "an @xmath3-user mux can be designed on the extension field gf(@xmath0 ) where @xmath9 . for the sake of simplicity , we begin with @xmath6=1 and consider a ( @xmath11)-channel mux as follows .",
    "typically , we can consider gf(3 ) corresponding to alternate mark inversion ami signaling .        a ( @xmath11)-cd consider digital carrier sequences per channel as versions of cas function over the galois ( complex ) field gi(@xmath1 ) . the cas ( cos and sin ) function is defined in terms of finite field trigonometric functions [ cam et al .",
    "98 ] , @xmath14 .",
    "+   + carrier 0 : + @xmath15 + carrier 1 : + @xmath16 + ... + carrier @xmath17 : + @xmath18 + ... + carrier @xmath19 : + @xmath20 .",
    "+   + the cyclic digital carrier has the same duration @xmath10 of a input modulation symbol , so that it carries @xmath3 slots per data symbol .",
    "the interval of each cas - symbol is @xmath21 and therefore the bandwidth expansion factor by multiplexing @xmath3 channels may be roughly @xmath3 , the same result as fdm and tdm / pam . + a first scheme of the multiplex is showed : the output corresponds exactly to the galois - hartley transform of the `` users''-vector @xmath22 .",
    "+ therefore , it contains all the information of the channels .",
    "each coefficient @xmath23 of the spectrum has duration @xmath21 .",
    "these carriers can also be viewed as spreading waveforms .",
    "an @xmath3-user mux has @xmath3 spreading sequences , one per channel .",
    "the requirements to achieve welch s lower bound according to massey and mittelholzer [ mas - mit 91 ] are hold by @xmath24 sequences .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 $ ] presents both orthogonal rows and columns and have the same energy. +   + a naive example is present in order to illustrate such an approach .",
    "a 4-channel mux over gf(5 ) can be easily implemented @xmath26 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that such signal are not fdmed nor tdmed .",
