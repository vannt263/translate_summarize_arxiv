    "networks abound in various fields ; a network is a collection of nodes and links , where a link connects a pair of nodes .",
    "most real - world networks are not entirely regular or random and have prominent properties as modeled by , for example , small - world , scale - free , hierarchical , and modular networks @xcite . in such networks ,",
    "some nodes are considered to be more important than the others .",
    "depending on the definition of importance , various centrality measures , which quantify the relative importance of different nodes , have been proposed .",
    "the most frequently used centrality measures are perhaps the degree ( i.e. , the number of links owned by a node ) and the betweenness ( i.e. , the normalized number of shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes passing through the node in question ) @xcite .",
    "new centrality measures have also been proposed in the field of complex networks @xcite .",
    "although many centrality measures are available , very few of these describe the importance of nodes in collective behavior of nodes on networks ( see @xcite ) . in a previous study",
    ", we proposed a centrality measure called the influence @xcite .",
    "the influence of a node denotes its importance in different types of dynamics .",
    "it represents the amplitude of the response of a synchronized network when an input is given to a certain node @xcite , the fixation probability for a newly introduced type ( e.g. , new information ) at a node in voter - type evolutionary dynamics @xcite , the stationary density of a simple random walk in continuous time @xcite , the so - called reproductive value of a node @xcite , and the influence of a node in the degroot s model of consensus formation @xcite .",
    "it makes sense to consider the influence only in directed networks ; in undirected networks , the influences of all the nodes take an identical value . in principle , the influence as a centrality measure is close to the pagerank , which was originally developed for ranking websites @xcite .    to assess the influence ( and also the pagerank ) in real complex networks",
    ", it is not sufficient to take into account the local property of the node , such as the degree .",
    "the global structure of networks such as the small - world property , modular structure , and self - similarity @xcite generally affects the influence values .    in the present study",
    ", we analytically determine the influence of nodes in model networks such as weighted chain , directed multipartite networks with a hierarchical structure , and a directed version of the watts - strogatz small - world network @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we exploit the symmetry in networks and the relationship between the enumeration of directed spanning trees and the influence .",
    "we reveal the discrepancy between the actual influence and that predicted by the mean - field approximation ( ma ) , which takes into account only the degree .",
    "in fact , the nodes that occupy globally important positions in terms of influence are generally different from those that are locally important .",
    "the globally important nodes govern the above - mentioned dynamics on networks . finally , to demonstrate the application of the influence as a centrality measure",
    ", we analyze a system of coupled oscillators and show that nodes with large influence values entrain other nodes relatively easily , i.e. , with a relatively small coupling strength .",
    "consider a directed and weighted network having @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the weight of the directed link from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "we set @xmath4 when the link is absent .",
    "the influence of node @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "we define @xmath5 as the solution for the following set of @xmath0 linear equations : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the indegree of node @xmath1 , and the normalization is given by @xmath8 .",

    "when node @xmath1 has many incoming links , node @xmath1 is interpreted to be governed by many nodes .",
    "then , @xmath5 can be small because of the divisive factor @xmath9 in eq .  .",
    "the rationale for the definition given in eq .",
    "is that @xmath5 represents the importance of nodes in different types of dynamics on networks , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "values of @xmath5 for two example networks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example nets ] .    note that @xmath10 for any network with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is the outdegree . the undirected network is included in this class of networks .",
    "therefore , the influence has a nontrivial meaning only in directed networks .",
    "this situation also holds true in the case of the pagerank ; in undirected networks , the pagerank is a linear function of the degree of node @xcite .",

    "does not satisfactorily describe @xmath5 in certain practically important types of networks , including the watts - strogatz small - world network .",
    "for these networks , we calculate the exact @xmath5 by using different methods .    the value of @xmath5 can be associated with the number of directed spanning trees rooted at node @xmath1 , as described below .",
    "equation   implies that @xmath5 is the left eigenvector of the laplacian matrix @xmath16 , whose ( @xmath17 ) element is equal to @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",

    "therefore , considering the fact that @xmath16 has eigenvalue 0 , we obtain @xmath29 equation   indicates that @xmath30 $ ] is the left eigenvector of @xmath16 with eigenvalue 0 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath31    according to the matrix tree theorem @xcite , @xmath32 is equal to the sum of the weights of all directed spanning trees of @xmath33 rooted at node @xmath1 .",
    "the weight of a spanning tree is defined as the product of the weights of the @xmath34 links used in the spanning tree .",
    "therefore , we can calculate @xmath5 by enumerating the spanning trees .",
    "in this section , we analytically calculate the influence for several networks . through these calculations , we show that the influence extracts the globally important nodes , which is beyond the scope of the ma : @xmath35 .",
    "such nodes are located upstream in the hierarchy that is defined by the directionality of the links or around the source of a valuable directed shortcut .",

    "thus , the condition for the entrainment is given by @xmath207    in general , entrainment @xcite and synchrony @xcite are easily realized for feedforward networks .",

    "first , we consider the case in which node @xmath196 coincides with the root node in the directionally biased random network , i.e. , @xmath130 .",
    "this case was analyzed in our previous studies @xcite . in the entrained state ,",

    "however , the effective link weight in the redrawn network is equal to @xmath53 , because most links in the original network are backward links with weight @xmath53 . by assuming that all links in the redrawn network have weight @xmath53 , the result for unweighted directed random graph @xcite translates into @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the layer number in the redrawn network .",

    "in this paper , we have analyzed the centrality measure called the influence in various networks .",

    "we have analytically shown that the source of the shortcut in a directed version of the watts - strogatz small - world network and the root node in hierarchical networks have large influence values .",
    "this is not accurately predicted if we approximate the influence of a node by its degree .",

    "we also analyzed the effect of the location of a pacemaker on the capability of entrainment in a system of coupled phase oscillators .",
    "the pacemaker located at a node with a large influence value entrains the other oscillators relatively easily .    in the analysis of some model networks , including the watts - strogatz small - world network , we used the method based on the enumeration of directed spanning trees",
    "this method can be applied to the estimation of the pagerank of nodes , because the pagerank can be mapped to the influence if we reverse links and rescale the link weight @xcite .",
