    "massive stars strongly influence the environment in which they have formed by stellar winds , ionizing radiation and supernova explosions .",
    "an ionization front which expands into the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) and hits a dense clump may compress it so heavily that gravitational collapse might be triggered .",
    "on the other hand , ionization heats up the material and can photoevaporate the clump .",
    "the remaining material of this competition may form low - mass stars  @xcite or brown dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a shock with a dense clump is called `` cloud - crushing '' .",
    "the cloud - crushing scenario has been studied numerically both for supernova shocks and ionization fronts .",
    "the first extensive studies of the fate of the shocked cloud already showed that strong vortex rings can be produced  @xcite .",
    "the mixing properties of the cloud depend sensitively on the initial density distribution  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simulations of dense clumps exposed to an ionizing flux but without strong shocks show the generation of kinetic energy  @xcite and fragmentation of the clump  @xcite .",
    "radiation - gasdynamical simulations have also been used to match observations in h ii regions , especially the eagle nebula  @xcite .",
    "although ionizing radiation injects a significant amount of energy into the ism , it does not seem to be an important driving mechanism of interstellar turbulence on a global scale  @xcite .",
    "however , the cloud - crushing process generates a considerable amount of turbulence locally in the wake of the cloud .",
    "we find that the motion of the cloud material is mostly supersonic while the ambient gas behind the front moves only subsonically .",
    "the continuous heating limits the lifetime of the dense material , but the supersonic motions are maintained until the cloud disperses .",
    "this is contrary to the situation in jet - clump interactions , where the situation is less clear with some studies showing mostly subsonic motions  @xcite while others claim supersonic velocity fields  @xcite .",
    "we perform 3d radiation - gasdynamical adaptive mesh simulations with the flash code  @xcite , which is based on the paramesh library  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the refinement with respect to shocks we also make sure that we resolve the jeans length with a sufficient number of cells to avoid artificial fragmentation  @xcite . the jeans length is the critical scale for self - gravitating objects , and a dynamical increase of resolution would indicate a runaway collapse .",
    "however , the run discussed in this paper show collapse only temporarily .    additionally to the standard hydrodynamics and self - gravity",
    ", we include the ionization feedback from a massive star .",
    "the radiation feedback is included via a raytracing approach  @xcite .",
    "there are no radiation pressure terms in the euler equations ; in this module coupling between hydrodynamics and radiation takes place only through thermodynamics .",
    "we solve a rate equation for the ionization fraction including collisional ionization and photoionization as well as radiative recombination .",
    "the energy equation contains a photoionization heating rate ; the equation of state is isothermal .",
    "the computational domain has dimensions @xmath2 with an effective resolution of @xmath3 cells .",
    "we place a self - gravitating supercritical gas sphere with bonnor - ebert density profile  @xcite , with mass @xmath4 in the centre of the domain .",
    "it slowly rotates with an angular velocity of @xmath5 around the @xmath6-axis corresponding to a ratio of rotational to gravitational energy of @xmath7 . additionally to the rotational velocity , a turbulent velocity field with a magnitude of at most 50% of the sound speed",
    "the temperature of the bonnor - ebert sphere is @xmath8 , while the ambient gas has @xmath9 .",
    "the ionizing source is located at the left hand side of the computational domain at @xmath10 .",
    "it has a temperature of @xmath11 and a luminosity of @xmath12 , representing a b0 star .",
    "the radiation heats the interstellar gas to @xmath13 .",
    "when the simulation starts , the gas next to the source becomes ionized and heated .",
    "an ionization front accompanied by a shock expands into the ism .",
    "when the shock hits the clump , the clump material is swept away and thereby compressed heavily .",
    "the shock leaves behind a fully turbulent gas .",
    "the hot ionized gas is being mixed with the cold clump material while the radiation heats it up continuously .",
    "after the shock front passes the clump , the former clump disperses completely .",
    "the time sequence of this process is as following .",
    "the shock touches the outer edge of the clump at @xmath14 . at @xmath15",
    ", it reaches the clump centre at @xmath16 , and at @xmath17 , the front has totally enclosed the clump . of course , the dense material delays the shock , so that the wings of the front can propagate faster .",
    "they enter the shadow zone and meet in the middle at @xmath18 .",
    "the clash of these wings is an important driving mechanism of the turbulence seen in these simulations .",
    "it builds up an extended turbulent wake while the ionization front propagates further into the ism . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the shock reaches the boundary of the computational domain at @xmath20 .",
    "the simulation stops at @xmath21 when the cloud has dissolved .",
    "some of the stages of this time evolution are depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we start our analysis with a brief look at the energy balance in the flow ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the plot shows the total energy @xmath22 , internal energy @xmath23 and kinetic energy @xmath24 in @xmath25 as a function of time @xmath26 .",
    "the b star provides energy to the system by ionising material .",
    "this contribution is predominantly transferred into internal energy by the photoionization heating , only a small fraction is converted into kinetic energy . for example , at @xmath27 , the ratio of internal over kinetic energy is @xmath28 .",
    "since the luminosity of the star is constant in time , the energy transferred from the star to the gas in the computational domain grows linearly .",
    "this explains qualitatively the form of @xmath29 in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a quantitative analysis is difficult however , since geometric effects have to be taken into account appropriately .",
    "one would have to account for the fact that the star emits its radiation isotropically , while it is not at the centre of a spherically symmetric computational domain , but on one face of a cartesian box .",
    "the simulation shows that the cloud - crushing flow is largely dominated by supersonic motion .",
    "this is because the cloud material is cold , so that the sound speed is much lower than in the hot gas behind the ionization front , where a wind with @xmath30@xmath31 is observed .",
    "the cause of the wind is that the photoionization heating is stronger close the source , which leads to a pressure gradient and a corresponding flow .",
    "since the wind prevails in the largest part of the domain , namely the hot postshock gas , the mean mach number @xmath32 is always below unity , while the maximum mach number @xmath33 , which is reached at crushing , can be greater than @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] depicts @xmath33 and @xmath32 as a function of time .",
    "the maximum mach number traces the shock ahead of the ionization front . within a time of @xmath35",
    ", the shock accelerates up to a constant velocity of @xmath36 . for a short time of another",
    "@xmath37 the velocity seems to saturate , but the continuous photoionization heating accelerates the shock again up to @xmath38 . at this point , when @xmath33 is maximal",
    ", the shock collides with the dense clump . as it hits the high - density gas , the shock front moves more slowly .",
    "the gas decelerates , so that @xmath33 decreases again . however , the wings of the shock that were not affected by the clump can enter the shadow zone , which leads to a peak in @xmath33 after @xmath39 .",
    "then these wings collide , which stops the motion in @xmath40-direction , so that the mach number decreases further .",
    "but the collision of the wings also leads to an acceleration in positive @xmath41-direction , which can be seen in a series of peaks from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "after @xmath43 , the shock leaves the computational domain , resulting in a sharp drop in @xmath33 .",
    "this demonstrates that the highest mach numbers are only reached in the shock front itself , not in the shock - generated turbulence behind the front .",
    "the motion in the turbulent wake is mostly supersonic with @xmath44 below @xmath45 .",
    "the mean mach number grows continuously until the shock leaves the domain , whereafter @xmath32 declines slowly .",
    "the heating of the gas does not change @xmath32 .",
    "the different stages of the simulation can also be recognized in the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the mach number @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows mass - weighted pdfs at the moment of cloud - crushing ( @xmath46 ) and after the shock has left the domain ( @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) . at the crushing time , the high @xmath44 above @xmath49 all belong to the shock .",
    "the shock then excites supersonic turbulence in the wake , but away from the shock @xmath44 above @xmath45 is very rare . while most of the dense gas is supersonic , most of the domain is dominated by low mach number flows , both at crushing time and afterwards .",
    "the pdfs of the total mach number @xmath44 should be compared with the mach number given only by the turbulent velocity fluctuations , @xmath50 , which is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the local speed of sound .",
    "these plots are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "since the bulk motion in @xmath41-direction is no longer taken into account , the mach numbers are significantly lower . at the moment of cloud - crushing ,",
    "the turbulent mach number is only slightly supersonic , while it is totally subsonic afterwards .",
    "hence , the bulk motion of the shock ( and also the transport of momentum by the wind ) is important to reach the high mach numbers observed above .",
    "we are also interested in the fraction of mass which moves supersonically . in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "we plot the ratio of the mass of supersonic gas @xmath53 and the total gas mass in the computational domain @xmath54 . despite of the complicated mixing processes ,",
    "@xmath55 grows roughly linearly until the shock leaves the domain .",
    "it is surprising that a significant part of the gas moves supersonically , altough most of the energy input is converted into internal energy ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "when the shock front leaves the domain , more than @xmath56 of the gas in our domain is in supersonic motion .      in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we enlarge a part of figure  [ fig1 ] belonging to the snapshot at @xmath57 and show additionally to the mass density also the temperature and the velocity components @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the remains of the dense core have a temperature around @xmath60 , while the ambient ionized medium is at @xmath61 .",
    "the high temperatures in the environment give rise to the `` rocket effect '' , which accelerates the gas in positive @xmath41-direction  @xcite .",
    "this is because the cold gas at the surface of the clump facing the star becomes heated .",
    "thus , it expands into the postshock medium , carrying momentum with it , and consequently the clump accelerates .",
    "the cloud - crushing leads to vortical structures in the wake as can be seen from the lower plots in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the two largest structures around @xmath62 and @xmath63 or @xmath64 , respectively , even have slightly negative @xmath58 and so does a region around the tip of the former core at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . averaged over the whole volume",
    ", however , the wind , wich moves with @xmath67 , causes a bulk motion of the gas in positive @xmath41-direction . in order to measure the turbulent components of the velocity field ,",
    "it is better to focus on the transversal directions .",
    "the peak amplitude of the velocity component in @xmath40-direction , for example , is about half of the maximum velocity in @xmath41-direction .",
    "the large vortical structures discussed above have total velocities around @xmath68 .",
    "the upper vortex rotates clockwise , while the lower vortex rotates counter - clockwise .",
    "a connection to observations of molecular clouds can be made by looking at velocity profiles along a certain line - of - sight  @xcite .",
    "examplary , we show in figure  [ fig8 ] a profile for @xmath59 of the dense core after crushing at time @xmath69 ( compare also figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the width of the beam is @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while @xmath40 ranges over the whole box width .",
    "note that the profile is a mass - weighted histogram , not a normalized pdf .",
    "we do the same calculation again , but this time only considering gas that has @xmath72 ( low @xmath73 case ) or @xmath74 ( high @xmath73 case ) . from the figure",
    "we see that the high velocity tails are exclusively related to the high temperature gas .",
    "the peak at low velocities comes mainly from both the low temperature medium as well as a warm envelope with temperatures between the cuts @xmath75 . additionally to the histograms , we have fitted gaussians to the low and high @xmath73 data .",
    "their variance gives a measure for the turbulent velocity and can be related to the width of spectral lines that are being oberserved .",
    "in the midplane .",
    "the different snapshots are taken at times @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the turbulent wake behind the former clump at the last stage is clearly visible . ]    , internal energy @xmath23 and kinetic energy @xmath24 are shown as function of time @xmath26 .",
    "the major contribution to @xmath22 comes evidently from @xmath23 , while @xmath24 is between one and two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the point in time where the shock , which carries most of the kinetic energy , leaves the computational domain can be distinguished easily . ]",
    "is displayed amplified by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "the peaks in @xmath33 can be associated with events in the cloud - crushing scenario . ]     between times @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "the shock front shows up as a peak in the regime of high mach numbers for the first point in time . at @xmath47 ,",

    ", the turbulent field @xmath79 is slightly supersonic , while the flow in the wake is only subsonic .",
    "this shows that the bulk motion contributes significantly to the high total mach numbers . ]     as a function of time @xmath26 .",

    "the remains of the dense clump are still cold , while the material in the wake is already heating up . while @xmath59 is a measure for the turbulent velocity fluctuations , @xmath58 shows the bulk motion of the gas . ]     around the dense core after cloud - crushing at time @xmath69 ( in arbitrary units ) .",
    "the figure shows both the total data and the low temperature @xmath72 and high temperature @xmath74 cuts .",
    "clearly , the high velocity contributions stem from the high @xmath73 gas , whereas the peak around zero relates mainly to the low @xmath73 gas and a warm envelope with @xmath73 between the two cuts . also shown",
    "are gaussian fits to the low and high @xmath73 cuts that give insight into the strength of the turbulent velocity fluctuations and can be compared with observed spectral line widths . ]",
    "we have seen that cloud - crushing by ionization fronts can lead to short - living supersonic turbulence .",
    "altough only a minute fraction of the energy input is converted into kinetic energy , up to @xmath56 of the affected gas is supersonic . while it is mainly the cold gas that is highly supersonic , it is the hot gas that moves the fastest .",
