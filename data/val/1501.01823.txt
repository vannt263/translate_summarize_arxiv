    "the study of the variable x - ray emission from x - ray binaries has matured very rapidly in the last decades with the launch of several x - ray satellites in the 90 s , which led to a clear observational picture of black hole candidates in x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) . in particular a rich phenomenology of fast x - ray variability has been observed . since their discovery , black hole x - ray binaries ( bhb )",
    "have been known to display variability on various time scales @xcite and low - frequency quasi periodic modulation of the light curves ( known as quasi - periodic oscillations , qpo ) from these systems were already found in several sources observed by the japanese satellite _",
    "ginga_. sixteen years of operation of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte , december 30 , 1995 to january 3 , 2012 ) satellite have contributed immensely to the understanding of these systems and led to an extraordinary progress in the knowledge of the variability properties of bhbs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical power density spectrum ( pds ) from a bhb is composed by a variable band - limited noise continuum and by a number of qpos observed both at low ( mhz to few tens of hz ) and high ( tens to hundreds hz ) frequencies @xcite .",
    "qpos are thought to originate in the innermost regions of the accretion flows around stellar - mass black holes and the study of their properties can provide important clues on the physics of accretion onto bhbs and on the behavior of the matter in presence of strong gravitational fields .",
    "various models have been proposed in order to explain the quasi periodic variability and the noise continuum ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for a more recent model ) , but none of them , at the present time , can give a comprehensive explanation of all the observed phenomena .",
    "in black - hole binaries , low frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) are detected in the frequency range @xmath0 hz ; they are classified as type a , b and c qpos , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we focus on the type - c lfqpos ; for a complete classification of qpo types in black hole binaries see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "type - c qpos are observed in the hard and hard intermediate state of bhbs in outburst as strong , narrow peaks in the power density spectra with centroid frequency between @xmath10.1 and @xmath130 hz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "lfqpos usually appear as a complex structure composed by a primary peak ( whose frequency is usually associated to the fundamental frequency of oscillation ) and by a number of additional peaks whose frequency is in harmonic relation with that of the that of the primary peak ( therefore associated to harmonics and sub - harmonics of the fundamental frequency ) .",
    "these secondary peaks are commonly interpreted as the result of the fourier decomposition of the non - sinusoidal quasi - periodic signal responsible of the appearance of the lfqpos .",
    "however , questions whether there exists a harmonic relation between different qpo peaks and on the identification of the fundamental peak have been raised in recent works ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we investigate the relation between the properties of the fundamental peak and of the harmonic content component of the type - c lfqpos detected in a sample of six bhbs observed by rxte : , , , , , ; see reviews by @xcite and @xcite for details of these sources .",
    "from the rxte archive we select a sample of six bhbs where clear type - c qpos have been reported in the hard and hard - intermediate state .",
    "we analyzed 97 rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) @xcite observations of black hole candidates @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the references report the detection and analysis of the qpos in these sources .",
    "table  [ table : obsdet ] summarizes the details of the observations that we considered .",
    "we selected only observations where the sources were either in the low - hard state ( lhs , see * ? ? ? * ) or in the hard intermediate state ( hims ) , where lfqpos are detected @xcite .",
    "then we selected only those observations whose pds showed at least two peaks that appeared to be integer multiples of each other .",
    "we kept only those observations showing type - c qpos ( classified according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; type - c qpos are observed over a large frequency range ( @xmath10.1 - 30 hz , variable depending on the source ) , while type - b and -a qpos only show very small variations in frequency ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; type - c qpos almost always show harmonic peaks and type - b are also usually accompanied by a harmonic , while such harmonics are not usually seen for type - a qpos .",
    "a sample of type - c qpos is suitable for our purpose to study the behaviour of the multiple qpos in the same pds as a function of their frequency as they span a relatively larger frequency range compared to other types of lfqpos .    for our work ,",
    "it is important to identify the peak corresponding to the fundamental frequency .",
    "usually , the strongest peak is the fundamental , but there can be exceptions .",
    "we checked all pds and derived the identification of the fundamental from works in the literature : ",

    "we rebinned the light curves to obtain a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz and we selected events in the channels 035 ; these channels corresspond to energy range @xmath1213 kev for the observations of year 1998 to 1999 and @xmath1214 kev for later observations in table  [ table : obsdet ] , see @xcite for details of rxte / pca .",
    "we used the ghats package under gdl to produce pds for continuous 32 seconds long data segments ( leading to a minimum frequency of @xmath3hz ) and we averaged them to obtain one single pds per observation .",
    "pds were normalized according to @xcite and converted to square fractional rms ( see * ? ? ?",

    "pds fitting was carried out with the standard xspec fitting package by using a one - to - one energy - frequency conversion and a unit response .",
    "following @xcite , we fitted the noise components with a variable number of broad lorentzian shapes .",
    "the qpos were fitted with a number of lorentzians depending on the presence of harmonic peaks . for each lorentzian component we calculated the characteristic frequency ,",
    "given by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we fit the pds to obtain reduced @xmath5 and report qpos with significance @xmath6 , where n is the normalisation and @xmath7 is its one sigma uncertainty on n obtained with the chi - squared minimization .    in most of the cases ,",
    "one single lorentzian is sufficient to fit each peak in the pds .",
    "however , in some cases , more than one lorentzian component is necessary , usually when the qpo frequency changes on time scales shorter than the observation time ( see @xcite and references within for details ) . for those cases , following @xcite",
    ", we report the frequency of the lorentzian with higher rms as the qpo frequency . in these cases ,",
    "the fwhm is estimated as the fwhm of the sum of the two lorentzians and errors on fwhm are calculated as quadratic errors of the individual components . in figure",
    "[ fig : pds ] we show a typical pds ( observation 30191 - 01 - 28 - 00 of ) , fitted with a model of multiple lorentzians . one or more zero centered lorentzians are required to fit the low frequency noise .",
    "we refer to the lorentzians used to fit qpos as l@xmath8 , l@xmath9 and l@xmath10 respectively , where l@xmath9 is the primary peak associated to the fundamental frequency , and l@xmath8 and l@xmath10 are associated to the sub - harmonic and the second harmonic of the fundamental , respectively .",
    "the frequencies of the narrow peaks are in the ratio within the errors and the rms of l@xmath9 is always greater than l@xmath8 and l@xmath10 .",

    "we detected l@xmath8 or l@xmath12 or both simultaneously with l@xmath11 in the power spectra of 69 observations ( # 1 to 72 , except # 37 , 59 , 60 ) of the total 97 observations in our sample ( see table  [ table : obsdet ] for details ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fwhmq ] we show the fwhm of the fundamental peak and its harmonics plotted as a function of the centroid frequency of each peak . in both panels we overplot dashed lines corresponding to q = 3 , 5 and 10 , where q is the _ quality factor _ and it is defined as @xmath13 .",

    "we have performed constant and linear fits to the data , but the large scatter prevents a statistical analysis of the relative goodness of the models .",
    "we investigated whether the frequency  fwhm correlation is linear ( @xmath14 ) or constant for l@xmath8 , l@xmath11 , l@xmath12 . since the l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 seem to have the same frequency ",

    "we detect more than one peak superimposed to a broad - band flat - top noise , ( see table  [ table : obsdet ] for details of the qpos ) .",
    "the secondary peaks l@xmath8 , l@xmath12 have centroid frequencies consistent with @xmath10.5 , @xmath12 times the frequency of the fundamental l@xmath11 . in figure  [ fig : qpos ] we see more clearly that l@xmath8 , l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 have frequencies in the ratio 0.5:1:2 , therefore they form an harmonic series in frequency .",
    "the presence of harmonically related peaks in a pds might be the result of the fourier decomposition of the signal .",
    "however , a scenario where such peaks are independent signals , can not be ruled out .    from the top panel of figure  [ fig : fwhmq ]",
    "we observe that the fwhm of l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 increases with frequency of the qpo .",
    "the fwhm of l@xmath8 however has a weak dependence on frequency .",
    "these trends are seen more clearly after rebinning the points in frequency ( large gray points in figure  [ fig : fwhmq ] ) .",
    "the resulting large grey points indicate a monotonically increasing trend of the fwhm with frequency for l@xmath11 , l@xmath12 and also that the fwhm of l@xmath8 qpos has a very weak or no dependence on frequency .",
    "the qpos in this plot cover the frequency range @xmath1216 hz . in order to test whether the same relation extends to lower frequencies ,",
    "we include type - c qpos ( from * ? ? ?",

    "* ) which extend frequency down to @xmath10.1 hz , ( bottom panel in figure  [ fig : fwhmq ] ) .",
    "adding points for l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 at lower qpo frequencies from @xcite we show that the fwhm - frequency relation for these two components extends down to @xmath10.1 hz .",
    "the lower frequency qpos ( @xmath10.1 hz ) correspond to harder energy spectra , when the noise level is high and the qpo is not as well resolved from the continuum as in the softer states . in such cases the qpo parameters",
    "are less constrained , ( especially the fwhm ) and this may be the cause of the scatter observed in the fwhm of qpos with frequency around @xmath10.1 hz . the coherence of a qpo is quantified by the quality factor q. the width of a quasi - periodic signal can be ascribed to either amplitude modulation ( am ) or frequency modulation ( fm ) or a combination of the two .",
    "the often - considered case of finite time of the oscillation is a special case of amplitude modulation .",
    "if only a single peak is seen in the pds , it is not possible to establish whether the broadening of the peak is due to amplitude or frequency modulation .",
    "however if a harmonic is also present , then a constant fwhm of the peaks indicates amplitude modulation and a constant q indicates frequency modulation .",
    "we observe that l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 are almost along the line of constant q ( top panel of figure  [ fig : fwhmq ] ) .",
    "if they were exactly along the constant q line , we could conclude that they are frequency modulated .",
    "however they are broader at higher frequencies .",
    "one possibility is that this is due to an additional amplitude modulation , although different combinations of fm and am can not be excluded .",
    "the sub - harmonics ( l@xmath8 ) have a constant fwhm and are broader , indicating that the sub - harmonic must be subject to an additional amplitude modulation , as the fwhm of these points show a large scatter , it is however still possible that an underlying frequency modulation is present .",
    "a similar approach to the one we follow in this paper was presented by @xcite and @xcite for the type - c qpos detected in and respectively .",
    "they discuss the fwhm frequency relation between peaks , flat topped noise and peaked noise detected in the pds . in our paper",
    ", we consider only the l@xmath8 , l@xmath11 , l@xmath12 peaks detected in the sample of bhbs listed in table  [ table : obsdet ] .",
    "@xcite in their study of qpos detected in the bhb , find that the four features l@xmath17 , l@xmath18 , l@xmath19 , l@xmath20 , l@xmath21 form a harmonic series in frequency ( where l@xmath18 , l@xmath22 , l@xmath23 correspond to l@xmath8 , l@xmath11 , l@xmath12 respectively in this paper ; l@xmath17 is the flat topped noise and l@xmath20 is the peaked noise component , see figure 1 in @xcite for details and @xcite , @xcite for terminology and classification of features detected in pds of bhbs ) .",
    "@xcite conclude that not all the features in the harmonic series follow the same fwhm frequency relation .",
    "l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 have same evolution in fwhm with frequency , where as l@xmath8 does not follow the same trend . based on this difference and other analysis of the rms , energy spectra in frequency , they suggest that l@xmath8 is not an harmonic artefact , but is an oscillation which has additional modulations than that of l@xmath11 and l@xmath12",
    ". our result agrees with this interpretation . in the case of lfqpos in ,",
    "@xcite conclude that for l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 , the coherence decreases as frequency increases , which suggests frequency modulation of these components . while l@xmath11 and l@xmath12 are indistinguishable in their dependence of coherence on frequency , l@xmath8 has a much lower coherence than it would , had it followed the same coherence - frequency relation .",
    "the constant width of l@xmath8 indicates amplitude modulation , which is large enough to overwhelm any possible frequency dependence .",
    "we have a similar conclusion for qpos across our sample of bhbs , see top panel of figure  [ fig : fwhmq ] . from the lower panel of figure",
    "[ fig : fwhmq ] , it is clear that only the l@xmath8 components are amplitude modulated , while the coherence of the fundamental and its harmonic is frequency dependent even at lower frequencies .",
    "comparing our results with @xcite and @xcite we find that the fwhm - frequency relations of type - c qpos reported by them are also seen across the sample of sources which we have analysed .",
    "the sub - harmonic and second harmonic components are amplitude modulated , which reduces their quality factor much more than the fundamental one , which is frequency modulated .",
    "moreover the sub - harmonic has a much larger amplitude modulation compared to the other qpos in the harmonic series and this effect is seen across a sample of black hole binaries . over the dependence of fwhm and frequency of l@xmath8 , l@xmath11 and l@xmath12",
    ", we detect a scatter in the fwhm .",
    "this scatter is not related to any observational effects such as observation duration as we detect no correlation in the fwhm and observation duration in case of qpos which are nearly equal in frequency .",
    "the investigation of the scatter which can have a significant impact on the interpretation of the data is beyond the scope of this paper and will be done in the future on the basis of a larger database of qpos .    whatever the nature of the observed frequencies and the physical origin of the variability , the modulation which gives rise to the width of the peaks detected in the pds appears to be complex .",
    "both amplitude and frequency modulation seem to be at work on separate harmonics of the signal , yielding a complex pattern which can be tested against theoretical models .",
