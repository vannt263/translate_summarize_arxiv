    "close - in exoplanets are expected to harbor extended atmospheres and in some cases lose mass through atmospheric evaporation , driven by x - ray and extreme uv emission from the host star .",
    "direct observational evidence for such extended atmospheres has been collected at uv wavelengths .",
    "however , the constraints on hydrogen densities in the extended atmosphere are weak , and depending on the ionization degree , can vary over several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we have conducted observational campaigns of transiting exoplanets in the soft x - ray regime ( 0.2 - 2 kev ) , where opacity is not caused by hydrogen , but by heavier elements such as oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon .",
    "a growing number of transiting exoplanet hosts has been detected in x - rays now , for example gj  1214 @xcite , corot-7 , and gj  436 . for our present study we chose the very x - ray bright stars hd 189733 and corot-2 , both of which host a transiting hot jupiter . using the x - ray telescopes _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , we have repeatedly observed the transits of hd 189733b and corot-2b .",
    "the x - ray images of the host stars are shown in fig .",
    "[ images ] . in each single observation , the host star is clearly detected .",
    "we then extracted x - ray light curves from each individual observation .",
    "a typical example of a single light curve for each target is shown in fig .",
    "[ single_lcs ] . in the case of hd 189733",
    ", we observed small - scale stellar variability , but large flares are rare .",
    "several small flares have been observed at other orbital phases , namely after the exoplanetary eclipse @xcite .",
    "corot-2 has been previously observed in x - rays with a high x - ray luminosity of @xmath0 erg / s . in our observations",
    "we confirm the high x - ray flux and additionally find several large flares ; an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ single_lcs ] , right .",
    "while the transit signal of the planet is not obvious in the individual light curves , we have detected the x - ray transit of hd 189733b in the stacked observations .",
    "we show the resulting co - added light curve in fig .",
    "[ transit_spin ] , left .",
    "the x - ray transit is detected at a confidence of 99.8% .",
    "the observed x - ray transit depth is 6 - 8% , depending on the assumed model @xcite .",
    "we can theoretically expect a limb - brightened transit model with a `` w''-like shape @xcite , because the corona is optically thin and therefore limb - brightened ( in contrast to the limb - darkened photosphere ) .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise is not high enough to reliably discriminate between limb - brightened and limb - darkened models . from the detected transit depth",
    ", we infer a minimum extent of the exoplanetary atmnosphere out to ca .  1.75 optical planetary radii , with particle number densities of the order of ca .",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 when assuming an atmospheric metallicity of ten times solar .         for corot-2b ,",
    "the individual light curves are much more dominated by intrinsic stellar variability , as the host star is more x - ray luminous by a factor of ten comapred to hd 189733 .",
    "detailed data analysis is still ongoing in order to identify suitable energy bands to minimize the influence of impulsive flares on the light curves .",
    "for x - ray studies of exoplanets it is helpful to have a relatively x - ray bright host star with low intrinsic variability .",
    "magnetic activity is the main source of both variability and x - ray emission for cool stars , and it is an intriguing question if close - in exoplanets can actually have an effect on the stellar activity though tidal or magnetic star - planet interactions @xcite .",
    "observational indications for such an ( intermittent ) magnetic effect on the chromospheres of exoplanet host stars have been reported early on for two systems @xcite .",
    "indications for tidal effects have been found through observations of stellar rotation periods and velocities @xcite as well as orbital obliquities of exoplanets @xcite .    to exclude observational biases from distorting the sample of host stars and their activities , which can arise due to the fact that small exoplanets often go unnoticed around active stars @xcite",
    ", we have developed a new approach to test for a planet - induced high stellar activity level .",
    "we have selected wide ( several 100 au ) stellar binaries in which only one of the stellar components is known to host an exoplanet .",
    "we have then obtained x - ray observations of the two stars in each binary system . with a known spectral type , age - activity relationships ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) allow to test if the two stars display activity levels which are consistent with a common age .",
    "we have used the x - ray luminosity of the secondary , which is the star without a known planet in our sample of five wide binaries , to estimate the age of the respective wide binary system .",
    "we then compare the observed x - ray luminosity of the planet - hosting star to the x - ray luminosity expected for that age .",
    "we find that for the two systems in which strong tidal interaction between exoplanet and host star is expected , the planet - hosting stars are over - luminous in x - rays by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ transit_spin ] , right ) . in three other systems in which the tidal interaction between star and planet is expected to be weak ,",
    "no such discrepancy is observed .",
    "this points towards a possible spin - up , or inhibited spin - down , of stars which host tidally strongly interacting hot jupiters .",
    "other possible explanations , such as high - amplitude stellar activity cycles , are unlikely due to the observed constancy of the stellar x - ray emission level over several years",
    ". observations of a larger sample of wide planet - hosting binaries are in progress ."
