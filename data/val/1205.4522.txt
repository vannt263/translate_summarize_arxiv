    "increasing the accuracy of the approximations to the exchange - correlation energy functional @xmath0 $ ] of kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) is of crucial importance for research areas ranging from theoretical chemistry and biochemistry to solid - state and surface physics ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",

    "many non - empirical approximate functionals , however , use its local version , which is a sufficient but not necessary condition to ensure the global bound ( see , e.g. , refs .   and  ) .",

    "the argument for the recourse to exact exchange is that dfa exchange works well only if combined with dfa correlation .",

    "the discussed models clearly outperform the stand alone dfas they are based on.@xcite nonetheless , employment of dfa quantities in their construction can lead to serious misbehavior in the curvature of the integrand as demonstrated by peach , teale and tozer@xcite by comparison of the mcy1 approximation with accurate quantities along the adiabatic connection ( see , e.g. , fig . 3 in ref .",
    ") . in the same paper",
    "the authors show that accurate exchange - correlation can be recovered by establishing an interpolation with accurate full - ci ingredients .",
    "a model that avoids unfavorable dfa bias is the interaction strength interpolation ( isi).@xcite here information from the weak interaction limit is employed , namely exact exchange and gl2 , together with information from the strong interacting limit through the point - charge plus continuum ( pc ) model , which provides approximate expressions for @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath19 $ ] is then modeled by an interpolation between the two limits .",
    "nowadays , the functionals @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] can be accurately computed within the sce many - electron formalism.@xcite refs .   and compare the pc solutions with the exact sce values for small atoms : while @xmath22 $ ] is a very reasonable approximation to its exact counterpart,@xcite the original @xmath23 $ ] turned out to be much less accurate.@xcite the exact results could be used to propose a revised pc approximation @xmath24 $ ] having accuracy similar to the one of @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "further comparison is undertaken in section [ sec : pc ] of this paper for a more refined quantity , the local energy density as it will be defined in the next sections .    although unplugged from any dfa bias ( if we use exact input quantities ) , an unpleasant feature of the isi is the violation of size consistency .",
    "this is due to the non - linear way the ( size - consistent ) ingredients @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] enter the interpolation . for example , the revised isi ( which behaves better in the @xmath26 limit than the original isi ) reads@xcite @xmath27=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda}\\left(a[\\rho]\\lambda+\\frac{b[\\rho]\\lambda}{\\sqrt{1+c[\\rho]\\lambda}+d[\\rho]}\\right )      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are non linear functions of @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] , determined by imposing the asymptotic expansions of eqs .   and :",

    "one would expect the physical energy density to be always in between the ks and sce energy densities , as the ks energy density represents the weakest possible correlation and the sce energy density the strongest possible correlation in the given density .",
    "however , the wave functions are chosen according to the global quantities @xmath116 yielding the global inequalities _ sce|_ee|_sce_=1|_ee|_=1_ks|_ee|_ks . locally , these inequalities can be violated without violating the global ones , and hence the physical energy density can go below the sce energy density .    the crossing feature can be attributed to polarization effects , that are present in the physical case , but are not contained in the ks and sce pair density . in the ks case",

    "the sce co - motion functions are simply the positions of the bcc lattice points with origin fixed at the reference electron .",
    "notice that the constraint that the density is uniform , eq .  , forces us to consider a `` floating '' wigner crystal , which corresponds to the linear superposition of all the possible origins and orientations of the crystal , thus restoring the translational symmetry .",
    "the exchange - correlation hole @xmath147 , with @xmath148 the pair - distribution function , can then be simply constructed by considering that the expected numbers of electrons in a spherical shell of radius @xmath149 around the reference electron at the origin is given by dn(r|0)= g(r)4r^2 .",
    "we can then place very narrow normalized gaussians ( almost delta functions ) at the bcc sites around the reference electron and take the spherical average .",
