    "charged polymer layers are a major concern of polymer science , featuring in numerous applications such as colloid stabilization , surface modification technologies , membrane preparation @xcite and emerging biotechnologies @xcite .",
    "a much - studied class of layer is the polymer brush , an assembly of chains end - tethered to a substrate ( see fig .  [ qb ] ) .",
    "charged brushes are important in biosensor technologies such as dna microarrays @xcite and have provided model systems to study collective physics of charged polymers at interfaces @xcite .",
    "properties such as brush height have been measured by the surface force apparatus , neutron scattering and other techniques @xcite .",
    "the principal theoretical frameworks have been self consistent field theory and scaling theory @xcite .",
    "scaling theories identified distinct brush `` phases '' @xcite and later a full `` phase '' diagram of brush types @xcite .",
    "most of this theoretical work has addressed weakly charged brushes where local gaussian chain statistics are only weakly perturbed by electrical forces .",
    "real polymers , however , are frequently strongly charged .",
    "the natural measure of this is the reduced backbone density ( `` manning parameter '' ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( monovalent ) charge spacing and the bjerrum length @xmath5   in water .",
    "strongly charged polymers include single - stranded dna ( @xmath6 @xcite ) and the widely studied polystyrensulfonate , pss ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7 at 80% sulfonation @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath8 is not small , two qualitatively new effects arise .",
    "( i ) strong repulsive forces may stretch chains beyond the linear gaussian regime into rodlike configurations with end - to - end size of order the chain contour length itself : the polymer size _",
    "saturates_. ( ii ) manning condensation @xcite . when @xmath9 , a rodlike polymer attracts its own counterions so strongly that a fraction condenses into a region close to the polymer , renormalizing the effective manning parameter to unity , @xmath10 .",
    "the implications of ( i ) and ( ii ) have been explored theoretically in certain brush regimes @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to establish complete phase diagrams for strongly charged brushes .",
    "one of our motivations is the urgent need to establish physics underlying dna microarrays , a technology based on dna layers of enormous importance in health care , drug development and basic biological research .",
    "we will show that the saturation and manning condensation effects described above , ( i ) and ( ii ) , lead to brush phases whose scaling forms for brush height @xmath1 and counterion layer thickness @xmath11 have no counterparts among weakly charged brushes @xcite .",
    "two brush classes are identified , defined by the magnitude of the intrinsic persistence length , @xmath12 .",
    "polymers in the `` strong '' class ( @xmath13 ) are strongly perturbed by charges , suffering length saturation for high enough backbone charge density whereas for `` weak '' systems ( @xmath14 ) manning condensation intervenes before saturation can onset .",
    "correspondingly , each class has a distinct brush phase diagram .",
    "the key point is that typical experimental brush systems are `` strong '' and their chains locally fully stretched , invalidating results based on flexible gaussian polymer concepts . brush height then depends on the salt - dependent persistence length @xmath15 for a semi - flexible polymer .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15 on salt concentration @xmath0 remains a highly controversial question @xcite .",
    "here we take @xmath16 , a relation with considerable empirical support @xcite , where @xmath17 is the debye screening length . for the particularly experimentally important `` quasineutral ''",
    "brushes our theory then predicts @xmath2 , in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "interestingly , no such agreement is obtained if one uses the often cited alternative quadratic osf form @xcite , @xmath18 .",
    "thus brush experimental data comes down rather firmly on the side of the @xmath19 relation .",
    "to appreciate saturation and condensation effects , it is helpful to first review results for a single charged chain of contour length @xmath20 and charge @xmath21 @xcite . throughout",
    ", we assume ideal gaussian chain statistics in the absence of charges . for small charge ,",

    "exert a stretching force @xmath24 @xcite ( setting @xmath25 ) where @xmath1 is the extended chain size . balancing this with the elastic restoring force @xmath26 and using @xmath27",
    "gives the electrostatic `` blob '' size    blob r_ba ( l / l_sat)^2/3  ,  l_sat(l_ba)^1/2  .    for small scales @xmath28 statistics are essentially gaussian , while on larger scales the polymer is electrostatically stretched into a linear string of blobs of length @xcite    singlechain h b^*(l^*/l)^2/3 ;   b^*la / l_b  ,   l^*l_b^2/a  .",
    "however , this result for @xmath1 can not be correct for all charge densities : from eq .   when @xmath29 the blob shrinks to one persistence length @xmath12 and the chain size becomes @xmath20 .",
    "this is _ size saturation _ ; further charging produces no further extension .",
    "( in this study , the window between onset of non - gaussian behavior and complete size saturation is ignored for simplicity . )",
    "this suggests @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "however , this reasoning neglects manning condensation .",
    "since the charge per blob is @xmath32 , the string of blobs has an effective linear charge density coarse - grained over the blob size equal to    qo q_0^eff(l^*/l)^1/3  ,   l^*l_b^2/a  .",
    "counterion condensation is triggered when @xmath33 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath34 .",
    "if we now consider a chain charging process ( decreasing @xmath4 from @xmath35 ) , this leads us to define 2 classes of polymer : ( 1 ) the weak class , @xmath14 . in this case @xmath36 , so manning condensation onsets before saturation . thus eq .   for chain size",
    "remains valid until @xmath34 when the polymer reaches its maximum size , @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath1 is pinned to @xmath37 and saturation never occurs .",

    "saturation now occurs before condensation can intervene , since @xmath41 .",
    "is valid until saturation at @xmath42 . for higher charge densities , @xmath30 .",
    "we remark that the treatment of manning condensation for weak systems above is oversimplified .",
    "one can go beyond this by treating the string of blobs as a cylinder of radius @xmath43 .",
    "adapting ramanathan s expression @xcite for the potential at a charged cylinder , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , a charging process then yields the free energy @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "taking the derivative gives the stretching force @xmath48 and balancing this with @xmath49 we find @xmath50 , confirming that apart from the log factor chain size is indeed pinned to @xmath37 .",
    "such logarithms , which arise elsewhere ( _ e.g. _ eq .  ) are ignored in the following for simplicity .",

    "we discuss strong systems only and the typical case @xmath93 .",
    "we find manning condensation then renormalizes any @xmath86 to @xmath94 with _ no evaporation effects_. thus fig.[evolution ] shows only the portion of the phase diagram above @xmath82 ; the region below is mapped vertically onto this line .",

    "thus we adapt the alexander - de gennes theory of neutral brushes @xcite viewing each chain as comprising blobs of size @xmath64 ( see fig .  [ qb ] ) . depending on @xmath4 ,",

    "[ evolution ] , with corresponding structures shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) in the saturated @xmath99 band , @xmath106 , polymers are locally rod - like as discussed for single chains .",
    "flexibility is recovered on scales above @xmath107 ( recall , we take persistence length @xmath108 ) .",
    "thus @xmath109 and there are @xmath110 effective monomers per polymer .",
    "( 2 ) the intermediate band , @xmath101 . here",
    "the charge density is below saturation and locally the polymer a string of electrostatic blobs of size @xmath43 ( see eq . ) .",
    "thus @xmath109 and @xmath111 . ( 3 ) in the overscreened @xmath91 band , screening penetrates individual blobs , @xmath102 , reducing their unscreened electrostatic energy which by definition equals @xmath104 .",
    "thus @xmath98 exceeds @xmath43 . from a flory type calculation",
    "we find @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "borrowing the neutral brush result @xcite , the brush height is @xmath114 , giving    hqb h_qb\\ {    ll ( /b)^2/3l ~n_s^-1/3 ( ) + ( /b)^2/3l(l_sat / l)^2/3 ~n_s^-1/3  (  ,  )    . .",

    "the result for band @xmath101 has been derived previously by borisov et al.@xcite .",

    "the bands @xmath116 remain , and chain size is the standard self - avoiding result @xmath117 .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the structure of a single charged chain found in ref .",
    "@xcite though the predicted exponents differ .",
    "we remark that if we assume the osf form for persistence length @xcite , @xmath118 , we find a qualitatively similar phase diagram to fig .",
    "[ evolution ] but now : ( i ) between the sat - sb and qb phases a very narrow saturated `` nematic brush '' region appears where rodlike effective monomers nematically order and ( ii ) new bands appear in the quasi - neutral phases .",
    "a crucial difference is that the predicted salt dependence in the qb regime is now @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude by comparing theory with two experimental studies of charged brushes .",
    "( 1 ) tran et al .",
    "@xcite used neutron scattering to measure monomer density profiles of high density brushes ( @xmath120  , @xmath121  ) of pss on silicon at sulfonation levels 35% to 62% . using a representative monomer size @xcite 2.1 ",
    ", this implies charge spacings @xmath122 @xmath123  .",
    "( 2 ) balastre et al .",
    "@xcite studied less dense pss brushes on mica ( @xmath124  , @xmath125  , sulfonation 84%-87% , _",
    "@xmath126  ) with the surface force apparatus .",
    "now pss is a strong system ( @xmath127  ) and both experimental systems are strongly charged , @xmath128 , thus belonging to the line @xmath82 in the strong phase diagram , fig.[evolution ] . hence at low salt ( @xmath129 ) we predict both systems lie in the sat - ob phase with fully stretched chains .",
    "indeed , the observed low salt brush heights are @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the tran et al .  and balastre et al .",
    "studies , respectively .",
    "this is deep into the non - gaussian regime @xcite , confirming the chains are close to size saturation .",
    "what happens when salt is added ?",
    "our theory predicts the system in effect moves along @xmath132 in fig .",
    "[ evolution ] , passing from the sat - ob phase ( @xmath133 ) to the @xmath99 band of the qb phase ( @xmath134 ) where chains are locally saturated .",
    "the predicted brush height @xmath1 is thus initially independent of salt concentration @xmath0 , then decaying as @xmath135 ( eq .  ) .",
    "something very close to these predictions is seen in both experiments : @xmath1 was roughly constant at low salt followed by a rather sharp transition to an approximate power law @xmath136 , with @xmath137 observed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath138 to @xmath139 in ref .",
    "the transition occurred at @xmath140 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath141 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since the tran et al .",
    "systems have very small @xmath64 , the qb is realized only at very high salt ; we speculate the somewhat lower exponent @xmath142 and higher transition @xmath143 value for this data may originate from non - electrostatic interactions ( more important at high salt ) .    throughout , we assumed gaussian statistics , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath144 solvents .",
    "how would different solvent conditions affect the strongly charged phases with saturation ?",
    "( i ) good solvents are expected to produce no qualitative change , since these phases are already locally or globally almost fully expanded .",
    "( ii ) very poor solvents and ion - ion correlation effects have been predicted to induce brush collapse @xcite . for pss , for example",
    ", water is a poor solvent for the ps backbone .",
    "however , for high charge densities solubility is recovered @xcite ; indeed , both pss systems above exhibit highly extended brushes at high charge density @xcite as discussed .    in conclusion , we find strongly charged brushes exhibit unique phases where chains are globally or locally almost fully extended into rod - like configurations .",
    "systematic experiments @xcite on strongly charged pss brushes find brush height @xmath145 const .  at low salt @xmath0 , crossing over to @xmath136 with exponents @xmath146 .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this in a weakly charged brush picture @xcite as a transition from the osmotic ( @xmath147 ) to the salt brush ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we find this is incorrect ; the transition is in fact from a saturated osmotic brush ( @xmath147 ) to a quasineutral brush with local saturation , for which we predict @xmath2 provided the persistence length scales linearly with debye length , @xmath19 @xcite .",
