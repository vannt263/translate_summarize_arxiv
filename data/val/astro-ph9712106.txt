    "many black hole candidate ( bhc ) systems show three or more spectral states : the `` low '' ( x - ray hard ) , `` high '' ( x - ray soft ) , and `` very high '' ( x - ray soft , plus a hard , power - law tail ) states .",
    "typically , sources are seen to be in the low state when they are below @xmath0 of their eddington luminosity , and they tend to exist in the high and very high states at observed luminosities above @xmath1 @xcite . in this article , we will concentrate on the properties of the low state , for which we have obtained @xmath2 ks of cyg x-1 data with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed for the low state of bhc in general , and for the low state of cyg x-1 in specific . currently , these models fall into two main classes : the compton corona models @xcite and the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models @xcite . for the compton corona models ,",
    "the currently favored geometry is one in which a central , spherical corona is surrounded by an exterior , cold disk @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the geometry proposed by the adaf models @xcite ; however , the adaf models invoke different sources for the comptonization seed photons , and they make more detailed predictions for the dynamics of the inner region .",
    "specifically , the advective inner region is moving quasi - radially , at close to the free - fall velocity , toward the black hole .",
    "we note that cyg x-1 has upon occasion , including very recently , transited to the high state @xcite .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed for this transition in both the compton corona picture @xcite and the adaf picture @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss this transition here .",
    "instead , we will concern ourselves with how variability data , i.e. the phase / time lags and the coherence function , can be used to constrain models within a given state . as described below",
    ", these data currently pose challenges for both the compton corona and adaf models of the low state .",
    "as an example of a successful ( in terms of fitting the energy spectra ) low state model , we consider the spherical corona model of dove et al . @xcite .",
    "its basic features are as follows .",
    "the inner region of the accretion system is modeled as a spherical cloud with total optical depth @xmath3 and an _ average _ temperature of @xmath4 kev .",
    "this spherical region is then surrounded by a cold ( @xmath5 ev ) , geometrically thin disk which reprocesses hard radiation from the corona , as well as provides seed photons for comptonization .",
    "the overall quality of the fit of this model to our cyg x-1 data is quite good ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we will use this as our `` straw man '' model when we discuss the limits that phase lags place on coronal models (  [ sec : compphase ] ) .",
    "the power spectral density ( psd ) is calculated by taking lightcurves from the data , dividing them into segments of equal length , and then taking the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of each data segment .",
    "the squared amplitude of each individual fft ( for a given lightcurve ) is then averaged together .",
    "furthermore , we usually average over ( logarithmically spaced ) fourier frequency bins as well .",
    "this yields the resulting psd for each lightcurve .",
    "here we choose a normalization such that the integral of the psd over fourier frequency yields the _ square _ of the total _",
    "root mean square ( rms ) amplitude _ of the variability @xcite .",
    "for a given narrow fourier frequency interval , the rms is ( to within a factor of @xmath7 ) the fractional amount by which the lightcurve is sinusoidally modulated in that given frequency interval .    in figure",
    "[ fig : psd ] we plot the psd of the low energy band ( @xmath8 kev ) for our cyg x-1 data .",
    "this psd , in both shape and amplitude , is very similar to what has been previously observed .",
    "we note , however , that there is a weak , broad feature at @xmath9 hz , with rms @xmath10 .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite indicates that the significance of this feature is @xmath11 .",
    "however , for reasons discussed in  [ sec : coher ] , this feature may be somewhat more significant than that .",
    "-0.2 true in",
    "-0.2 true in    fourier phase lags ( and equivalently fourier time lags ) are calculated from the ffts constructed from data segments of two different , but concurrent , lightcurves .",
    "let @xmath12 be a `` soft energy '' light curve and @xmath13 be a `` hard energy '' lightcurve .",
    "the fourier phase lag , @xmath14 , is then just the phase of the ( complex ) quantity @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ffts of the concurrent data segments of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath18 denotes a complex conjugate and the angle brackets denote an average over data segments and/or fourier frequency bins .",
    "the time lag , @xmath19 .    in general , both the phase lag and time lag are non - constant functions of fourier frequency , @xmath20 .",
    "however , we naively expect that the _ longest _ observed time lag in the system is no longer than the _",
    "longest _ distance in the system divided by the _ slowest _ propagation speed . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] , this longest time for cyg x-1 is @xmath21 s. this is considerably longer than both the expected free - fall timescales for adaf models and the sound travel time of hot corona models . therefore , these data may pose a problem for both of these models .",

    "imagine that we have a source of fluctuations that produces soft x - ray photons that is some distance from a region that produces hard x - ray photons .",
    "if the disturbances can propagate from the soft photon producing region to the hard photon producing region without dispersion then we expect there to be a time delay between the soft and hard photons that is _ independent of fourier frequency _ , @xmath20 .",
    "the time delay at all fourier frequencies will simply be the distance between the soft x - ray source and the hard x - ray response divided by the propagation speed .",
    "this means that the fourier phase lag will increase linearly with @xmath20 ( modulo integer multiples of @xmath27 ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] , the time lags observed in cyg x-1 are not independent of fourier frequency . if anything , the fourier phase lag is more approximately independent of @xmath20 .",
    "a crude , but illustrative , model of this is as follows .",
    "if @xmath17 is the transform of the hard photon light curve and @xmath16 is the transform of the soft photon light curve , let @xmath28 where both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants , and the @xmath31 is for @xmath32 and the @xmath33 is for @xmath34 .",
    "[ the antisymmetry in the relative phase is due to the fact that real light curves produce fourier transforms where @xmath35 . ]",

    "roughly 90% of the soft and hard lightcurves are exactly coincident with one another .",
    "it is often convenient to think of propagating disturbances in terms of sources and responses .",
    "for example , we might have a disturbance , @xmath42 that obeys a wave equation ( ^2  -   c_p^-2 ^2 ) ( x , t )  =   -4 _ d(x , t )  , [ eq : wave ] where @xmath43 is the source of the disturbance .",
    "imagine that the source of fluctuations , @xmath44 , is separable in space and time .",
    "let us also assume that the _ observed _ soft x - ray light curve is equal to the disturbance , @xmath45 , times a weighting function , @xmath46 , integrated over the system .",
    "likewise , let us assume that the _ observed _ hard x - ray light curve is related to @xmath45 via a weighting function @xmath47 .",
    "as was discussed by vaughan & nowak @xcite , it is relatively straightforward to calculate the resultant phase lags for this case .",
    "furthermore , the resultant `` transfer function '' between the soft and hard lightcurves has many of the qualitative properties discussed in  [ sec : simpint ] .",
    "-0.2 true in    as a simple example , let us consider the ( phenomenological ) weighting functions : g_s(r ) & & ( r - 6 ) * ( -_s r )  ,   + g_h(r ) & & ( r - 6 ) * ( -_h r )  , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants , and @xmath50 represents a step function . here",
    "we shall take @xmath51 and @xmath52 , so that the response of the soft x - rays is predominantly at @xmath53 and the response of the hard x - rays is predominantly at @xmath54 . for the case of cyg x-1 , we will take @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the resultant phase lags then depend upon @xmath57 , the propagation speed of the disturbances ( which we take to be uniform , with the waves directed toward a `` sink '' at the inner disk edge ) @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : green ] , such a model qualitatively reproduces the observed phase lags .",
    "however , to obtain quantitative agreement with the phase lags at low fourier frequency ( @xmath21 hz ) , a very slow propagation speed of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the speed of light , is required . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : basics ] , such a slow speed is much less than both the radial velocity in adaf models , as well as the sound speed for compton corona models , and therefore is problematic for both models .",
    "any _ intrinsic _ time delays between soft and hard photons for comptonization seed photons will be modified as the seed photons diffuse through the compton cloud @xcite .",
    "the greater the observed output energy , the longer the diffusion time through the compton corona . as has been discussed by miller @xcite and nowak & vaughan @xcite ,",
    "the _ minimum _ expected time delay is the difference in the diffusion time for the _ observed _ hard and _ observed _ soft photons .",
    "we have calculated this minimum time delay for the compton corona model discussed in  [ sec : compt ] , and show this along with the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : shelf ] . depending upon whether one identifies the @xmath60 hz time lags or the @xmath61 hz time lags as the upper limit for such a time lag `` shelf '' , an _ upper _ limit to the coronal radius is seen to be @xmath62 or @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , respectively . for either case",
    ", such a small radial extent of the corona poses a severe problem for adaf models , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] , which would then have great difficulty explaining the longest time lags .",
    "( there still remains the possibility for compton corona models that the longest time lags are `` intrinsic '' time lags from the outer cold disk , merely `` reprocessed '' by the corona @xcite . )    to be conservative , we identify the @xmath65 hz data as the upper limit for the shelf , as the @xmath66 hz data shows a strong loss of coherence ( cf .",
    "fig [ fig : coher ] ) .",
    "we clarify this point below where we describe exactly what we mean by the coherence function .",
    "-0.2 true in",
    "the coherence function has been extensively discussed by vaughan & nowak @xcite . essentially , it is the average , normalized amplitude of the cross power spectral density ( which is what one is computing to find the time lags ) .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : lag ] , the coherence function , @xmath67 is given by c(f )  .",
    "various methods exist for determining , and minimizing , the effects of poisson noise on the estimate of this function @xcite .    as also discussed by vaughan & nowak @xcite ,",
    "most previously considered mechanisms for producing variability in bhc systems ( i.e. multiple shots or flares , any `` nonlinear '' processes , etc . )",
    "will lead to a strong _ loss _ of coherence .",
    "this makes the near unity coherence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coher ] quite remarkable .",
    "the near unity coherence seen between @xmath68 hz argues for a single source of disturbances and/or a global response in cyg x-1 over ( these rather disparate ) timescales @xcite .    in a very real sense ,",
    "the coherence function is a measurement of the degree of constancy of the phase lags between soft and hard photons as one averages over individual data segments and fourier frequency bins ( as discussed in  [",
    "sec : basics ] ) .",
    "if the phase is constant from data segment to data segment , the coherence is unity . a variable phase , as might be caused by two or more uncorrelated processes relating soft and hard photons , will lead to coherence loss @xcite . as the coherence drops rapidly above @xmath61 hz , we can not be sure that the observed time lag in this regime is indicative of _ solely _ the diffusion through a compton corona .",
    "for this reason , we take the @xmath65 hz data as the conservative estimate .",
    "-0.2 true in    note also that there is a definite loss of coherence below @xmath69 hz .",
    "there is a clear trend which is only broken near @xmath9 hz . at that point , there is a recovery of coherence to near unity , coincident with the feature seen in the psd ( cf .",
    "[ fig : psd ] ) .",
    "this indicates that , although the lomb - scargle periodogram indicated a significance of only 50% , this feature may actually be significant . at the very least",
    ", it argues that psds of cyg x-1 should be extended to frequencies as low as @xmath70 hz whenever statistics permit .",
    "we have discussed the role of fourier phase / time lags and variability coherence in constraining spectral models of bhc .",
    "much of the theory behind this work can be found in the papers of dove et al .",
    "@xcite , miller @xcite , nowak & vaughan @xcite , and vaughan & nowak @xcite . to illustrate our points ,",
    "we have presented _ rxte _ data of cyg x-1 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    despite the general success of spectral models , such as the compton corona model discussed in ",
    "[ sec : compt ] , the variability data pose substantial challenges . for example , both the adaf models and compton corona models ( if they rely on sound speed propagation timescales ) have substantial difficulty in explaining the longest observed time lags . explaining the observed unity coherence in cyg x-1 will be difficult for all models unless they can postulate a _ global _ variability mechanism .",
    "the shortest observed time lags were also seen to provide upper limits to the size of a spherical compton corona .",
    "the `` recovery '' to near unity coherence at @xmath71 hz , coincident with a weak feature in the psd , indicates the possibility of an extremely low frequency oscillation in cyg x-1 .    in short , no currently proposed model for the low state of bhc in general , or the low state of cyg x-1 in specific , can claim to completely describe both the spectral and variability data .",
    "however , with the advent of _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ , which between them are capable of broad spectral coverage and fast timing , only models that can explain , or at least be consistent with , both the spectral and variability data should be considered to be viable",
