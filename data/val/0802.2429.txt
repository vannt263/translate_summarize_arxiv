    "this paper deals with selective pressure and diversity in cellular genetic algorithms ( cgas ) which are a subclass of genetic algorithms where the population is embedded in a grid .",
    "these concepts are closely related to the exploration / exploitation trade - off .",
    "previous studies on cgas selected the size and the shape of neighborhoods @xcite , or the shape of the grid @xcite as basic parameters to tune the search process .",
    "altering these structural parameters entails a deep change in the way we deal with the problem .",
    "for instance , there is no built - in mean to swap from a rectangular grid to a square grid without misshaping the neighborhood relation .",
    "we suggest using _ anisotropic selection _ ( as ) to promote diversity and to control accurately the selective pressure in genetic search . the main advantage of the _ anisotropic selection _",
    "scheme is that it allows to control the exploration / exploitation trade - off without affecting neither the grid topology nor the neighborhood shape ; so the cellular genetic algorithm we propose merely works on a square grid and a simple von neumann neighborhood shape .",
    "+ the paper is divided in 6 sections .",
    "section [ section1 ] gives a brief definition of cgas and an overview of existing techniques used to control the exploration / exploitation tradeoff .",
    "section [ section2 ] introduces the as scheme .",
    "section [ section3 ] studies the influence of as on the selective pressure . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we compare as and rectangular grids topologies influence on the selective pressure . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we show how as promotes the emergence of niches . in section [ section6 ]",
    "we use a cga on a quadratic assignment problem to measure the correlation between anisotropy and performance .",
    "finally we tie together the results of the previous sections and suggest directions for further research .",
    "this section presents a brief overview on cellular genetic algorithms and a standard technique to measure the selective pressure .",
    "[ section1 ]      cellular genetic algorithms are a subclass of genetic algorithms ( gas ) in which exploration and population diversity are enhanced thanks to the existence of small overlapped neighborhoods @xcite . such algorithms are specially well suited for complex problems @xcite .",
    "we assume a two - dimensional toroidal grid as a spatial population structure .",
    "each grid cell contains one individual of the population .",
    "the overlapping neighborhoods provide an implicit mechanism for migration of genetic material throughout the grid .",
    "a genetic algorithm is assumed to be running simultaneously on each grid cell , continuously selecting parents from the neighborhood of that grid cell in order to produce an offspring which replaces the current individual .      a standard technique to study the induced selection pressure without introducing the perturbing effect of variation operators is to let selection be the only active operator , and then monitor the number of best individual copies @xmath0 in the population @xcite .",
    "the takeover time is the time it takes for the single best individual to conquer the whole population .",
    "the grid is initialized with one cell having the best fitness and all the other having a null fitness . since no other evolution mechanism but",
    "selection takes place , we can observe the way the best individual spreads over the grid by counting generation after generation the number of copies of this one .",
    "a shorter takeover time thus means a higher selective pressure .",
    "it has been shown that when we move from a panmictic population , as in standard ga , to a spatially structured one of the same size with synchronous updating of the cells , the global selection pressure induced on the entire population is weaker @xcite .",
    "links have been established between takeover time and neighborhood size and shape or grid topology .",
    "neighborhood size and shape in a cga are parameters that have some influence on the takeover time",
    ". a larger overlap of local neighborhoods of the same shape speeds up the best individual s spreading over the grid .",
    "the influence of the shape is given by sarma and de jong through a measure on the neighborhood which represents the spatial dispersion of a cell pattern @xcite .",
    "rather than the size of the neighborhood in terms of individuals , the key particularity of a local neighborhood is its radius .",
    "the takeover time decreases while the radius increases in a spatially structured population .",
    "[ sec - effectgridtopo ] we measure the relation between grid topology and selective pressure for rectangular grids where the population size is fixed to @xmath1 .",
    "we use the following grid shapes : @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 individuals .",
    "the selection strategy is a binary tournament .",
    "for each cell we randomly choose two individuals in its neighborhood .",
    "the best one then replaces the individual of the cell on the grid if it is fitter or with probability 0.5 if fitnesses are equal .",
    "figure [ fig - crois - tournoi ] shows the average of @xmath8 independant runs of growth of @xmath0 against generations ; the takeover time is reached when @xmath0 is equal to the size of the grid ( see table i ) . the average growth rate @xmath9 , that is the number of new best individual copies per time unit , of these curves for four rectangular grid shapes ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4,@xmath5 ) is plotted in figure [ acrois_tournoi ] .",
    "this figure helps us to understand the growth of @xmath0 .",
    "the growth rate @xmath9 is the same for all grids for the first generations .",
    "then , the spreading speeds down to reach a constant speed for rectangular grids .",
    "this constant is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the probability of selecting the best individual when there is one copy of it in the neighborhood and @xmath12 the shortest side of the grid @xcite .",
    "more accurately , @xmath9 decreases when @xmath12 is filled by copies of the best individual ( see figure [ display_rec](b ) ) .",
    "then , the speed becomes constant until the best individual has spread over to the other side ( see figure [ display_rec](c ) ) .",
    "this explains why the @xmath2 grid curve has no constant period : the two sides are filled at the same time .",
    "finally , the growth rate falls down to zero as the best individual finishes conquering the grid .",
    "the results of the experiments we conducted are in agreement with e.alba and j.troya observations that narrow grid shapes induce low selective pressure @xcite .",
    "we will see in the next sections that this behavior can be observed with the as too .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ display_two ]",
    "we experiment a cga using anisotropic selection on a quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) : nug30 .",
    "our aim here is not to obtain better results with respect to other optimization methods , but rather to observe the behavior of a cga with as . in particular , we seek an optimal value for the anisotropy degree .",
    "the qap is an important problem in both theory and practice .",
    "it was introduced by koopmans and beckmann in 1957 and is a modal for many practical problems @xcite .",
    "+ the qap can be described as the problem of assigning a set of facilities to a set of locations with given distances between the locations and given flows between the facilities .",
    "the goal is to place the facilities on locations in such a way that the sum of the products between flows and distances is minimal .",
    "+ given @xmath13 facilities and @xmath13 locations , two @xmath14 matrices @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 is the distance between locations @xmath18 and @xmath12 and @xmath19 the flow between facilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the objective function is : + @xmath22 where @xmath23 gives the location of facility @xmath20 in the current permutation @xmath11 .",
    "+ nugent , vollman and ruml suggested a set of problem instances of different sizes noted for their difficulty @xcite .",
    "the instances they suggested are known to have multiple local optima , so they are difficult for a genetic algortihm .",
    "we experiment our algorithm on their 30 variables instance called nug30 .",
    "we consider a population of 400 individuals placed on a square grid .",
    "each individual represents a permutation of @xmath24 .",
    "we need a special crossover that preserves the permutations :    * select two individuals @xmath25 and @xmath26 as genitors . *",
    "choose a random position @xmath20 .",
    "* find @xmath21 and @xmath18 so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . *",
    "swap positions @xmath20 and @xmath21 from @xmath25 and positions @xmath20 and @xmath18 from @xmath26 .",
    "* repeat @xmath29 times this procedure where @xmath13 is the length of an individual .",
    "this crossover is an extended version of the upmx crossover proposed in @xcite .",
    "the mutation operator consists in randomly selecting two positions from the individual and exchanging these positions .",
    "the crossover rate is 1 and we perform one mutation per individual in average . + we consider 500 runs for each anisotropy degree .",
    "each run stops after 1500 generations .",
    "figure [ alpha - perf ] shows the average performance of the algorithm towards @xmath30 : for each value of @xmath30 we average the best solution of each run .",
    "performances are growing with @xmath30 and then fall down as @xmath30 is getting closer to its limit value .",
    "this curve shows the influence of the selective pressure on the performances and how important it is to control it accurately .",
    "the best average performance is observed for @xmath31 , which corresponds to a good exploration / exploitation tradeoff . in the neighborhood of this optimal value",
    "the algorithm favors propagation of good solutions in the vertical direction with few interactions on the left or right sides .",
    "this kind of dynamics is well adapted to multi - modal problems as we can reach local optima on each columns of the grid and then migrate them horizontally to find new solutions .",
    "performances would probably improve if the selective pressure did not remain static during the search process .",
    "as in @xcite , we can define some criteria to self - adjust the anisotropy degree along generations .",
    "furthermore , we can assign a different anisotropy degree to each cell of the grid , so that we can determinate criteria to self - adjust selective pressure locally upon measures on neighborhoods .",
    "this paper presents a new selection scheme in cellular genetic algorithms .",
    "the main objective is to control the exploration / exploitation tradeoff in a flexible way .",
    "we propose to exploit the cellular ga characteristics to promote diversity during a genetic search process .",
    "previous studies on cgas selected structural parameters , as neighborhood or grid shape , to tune the selective pressure .",
    "the main drawback of these techniques is that altering a structural parameter entails a deep change in the way we deal with the problem .",
    "the new selection scheme we suggest is based on _ fuzzy neighborhood _ where a cell is chosen according to different probabilities . in order to favor one direction rather than the other one , _",
    "anisotropic selection _ chooses individuals in fuzzy neighborhood .",
    "experiments performed in order to establish relation between the takeover time and the degree of anisotropy are consistent with our expectation that selection pressure decreases with the degree of anisotropy .",
    "analysis of the growth curves allows to distinguish three different phases in the diffusion process .",
    "experimental results establish linear correlation in takeover between as and cga using rectangular grid .",
    "then we point out capabilities of as to promote the emergence of niches . finally , using a cga with as on a qap",
    "we have shown the existence of an anisotropic optimal value of @xmath30 such that the best average performance is observed .",
    "this paper is a preliminary investigation and a more extensive analysis must be made to confirm that equilibrium between exploration and exploitation makes as a good technique for complex problems in static or dynamic environments .",
    "future work should address the following issues : comparison between as and changes in the neighborhood shape and size , measuring as effects with cga using mutation and crossover , change the balance of directions dynamically .",
    "the latter point is an important feature : by tuning the control parameter @xmath30 , it would be possible to make the algorithm to self - adjust the selective pressure , depending on global or local measures .",
    "this adaptive ability has two important advantages : first , parameter @xmath30 may vary in a continuous way , second , variations of this parameter have affect neither on the grid topology nor on the neighborhood shape .",
    "such self - adaptive algorithms have been studied in previous works , but they need to change the grid topology to control the selective pressure @xcite , which means it is uniform in the grid . as allows different propagation speeds on each area of the grid , promoting diversification and intensification ( exploitation ) at the same time on different spots . in general , we have to continue investigation of _ anisotropic selection _ to assess its validity and generality .",
