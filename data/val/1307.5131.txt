    "another equally intriguing possibility is that the spins of a quantum magnet _ do _ order , but in a way which does not transform like a spin .",
    "such a state would be almost invisible to the usual probes of magnetism , and could therefore appear as a `` hidden order '' .",
    "a concrete example of this is the quantum spin - nematic  a magnetic analogue of a liquid crystal@xcite .    conventional nematic order is associated with the directional order of rod- or disk - like molecules .",
    "spin - nematic order occurs where the _ fluctuations _ of a spin mimic a uniaxial molecule , selecting an axis without selecting a direction along it .",
    "for example , a system could exhibit fluctuations such that while maintaining .",
    "such a phase would break spin - rotation symmetry _ without _ breaking time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this particular type of spin - nematic state can be described as `` ferro - quadrupolar '' ( fq ) , since the fluctuations form a quadrupole moment of @xmath1 with a common axis on all sites ( for an introduction , see [ ] ) .",

    "there are now good theoretical reasons to believe that spin - nematic order should occur in a range of low - dimensional and frustrated systems .",

    "the resulting continuum theory exactly reproduces published results for `` flavour - wave '' analysis of the lattice model  @xcite . however , the continuum theory is both independent of the `` flavour - wave '' theory and far more general , and could equally well be parametrised from experiment , or from analysis of a more - complicated microscopic model where the `` flavour - wave '' approach is not applicable .",
    "good reviews exist of `` flavour wave '' techniques for spin - nematic order  @xcite , but sigma - model approaches have yet to be reviewed , and have so far been restricted to fq order  @xcite .",
    "we therefore provide a complete and pedagogical account of the steps needed to derive a non - linear sigma - model description of afq order .",
    "the fact that different branches of excitation correspond to different rotations of the order parameter , allows us to assign each branch of excitations a clear physical meaning . in the case of 3-sublattice afq order , we identify two , physically - distinct types of magnetic excitation  three degenerate branches of `` quadrupole waves '' , the gapless , linearly - dispersing goldstone modes of afq order , and three degenerate branches of gapped , high - energy `` spin - wave '' excitations .",
    "the spin - wave excitations have a substantial fluctuating dipole moment , and so should be clearly visible in experiment .",

    "observation of these features in experiment would provide strong evidence for spin - nematic order , and a means of distinguishing between different types of spin - nematic states .",

    "we will return to the role of interactions in a future publication@xcite .",
    "we note that any treatment of the 2-particle continuum excitations _ must _ take the role of 3- and 4-particle interactions into account if it is to obey the symmetry - constrained sum rules , and for this reason we do not discuss the continuum in this publication .",

    "in this respect , spin - nematic order has much in common with multipolar ` hidden order ' phases in rare earth magnets@xcite . in principle , spin nematic order _ could _ be probed through its excitations .",
    "however , because of the complexity of the problem , these remain relatively poorly understood .    in this paper",
    "we have attempted to narrow the gap between theory and experiment , by constructing a continuum field theory of a three - sublattice antiferroquadrupolar ( afq ) spin - nematic state .",
    "this field theory offers a ` model - independent ' approach to interpreting experiment , and can be used to explore the physical nature of the magnetic excitations of afq states . in the absence of magnetic field , we find that the long - wavelength excitations of afq states naturally divide into a set of three gapless , quadrupole - wave modes ,  the goldstone modes  together with three gapped excitations with a strong spin - dipole character .",
    "this field theory can also be used to make concrete predictions for the fluctuating spin - dipole fields associated with each type of excitation , and its associated signature in experiment . in this paper",
    "we have focused on the most direct probe of spin - dipole fluctuations  inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "we find that quadrupole waves couple only weakly with neutrons , with the intensity of scattering vanishing linearly at low energies .",
    "however the gapped modes possess a substantial dipole moment and couple strongly to neutrons .",
    "the observation of this gapped excitation , together with a set of ghostly low - energy goldstone modes , in the _ absence _ of magnetic bragg peaks , would constitute strong evidence for afq spin - nematic order .",
    "finally we make predictions for the dynamical quadrupole susceptibility .",
    "this exhibits diverging bragg - peak like intensity approaching the goldstone modes , along with a very faint gapped mode . as in the f - electron systems",
    ", this may be measurable using resonant x - ray scattering .",
    "such experiments would directly probe the order parameter , and could in consequence provide compelling evidence for the existence of spin - nematic order .",
    "how these excitations evolve with field , and what their consequences are for nmr @xmath2 relaxation rates will be explored in separate publications@xcite .",
    "an obvious question for future work is the role of interactions . as in the case of fq order [ ] , interactions between the goldstone modes of the afq state",
    "endow these excitations with a finite , @xmath259-dependent lifetime .",
    "there is also a corresponding renormalisation of the director stiffness , @xmath260 , leading to small changes in the velocity of the goldstone modes .",
    "however , the most interesting features come from the interaction between the goldstone modes and the gapped , long - wavelength `` spin - wave '' modes .",
    "this is true both from an experimental point of view , since the gapped modes support large spin - dipole fluctuations , and a theoretical point of view , where these type of interactions have not been as thoroughly explored as those between goldstone modes .",
    "we will return to these effects in a future paper@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the @xmath10 generalisation of the non - linear sigma model developed in this text provides a robust means of characterising spin - nematic states with antiferroquadrupolar order , which is independent of any particular microscopic model .",
    "this sigma model approach provides an excellent starting point for understanding the universal behaviour of spin - nematic states , and leads to concrete , testable predictions for experiment . for this reason",
    ", it can serve as an important tool for establishing whether spin - nematic order exists in a wide variety of real materials .",
    "we hope that the waves predicted by the sigma model will , in the near future , be seen .    _",
