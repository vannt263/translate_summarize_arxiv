    "the electronic properties of graphene have attracted much attention from various points of view . it is found that graphene shows the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite and dissipationless supercurrent .",
    "@xcite these effects are attributed to the energy band structure of graphene which consists of two dirac cones at the k and k points in the @xmath0-space .",
    "the dynamics of electrons around each dirac point is approximated by the weyl equation , which describes a `` massless '' particle .",
    "the `` massless '' particle never stop and the wave function is generally extended .",
    "however , electrons can be localized near the zigzag edge of graphene , which are called the edge states .  @xcite the appearance of the edge states is sensitive to the shape of the edge ,",
    "that is , the zigzag edge induces the edge states while the armchair edge does not . since the energy dispersion of the edge states as a function of the wave vector along the edge direction appears near the dirac points ,",
    "the local electronic properties such as ferromagnetism  @xcite and superconductivity  @xcite near the zigzag edge are proposed in terms of the edge states .",
    "the edge states exist near the zigzag end of a single - wall carbon nanotube , too , because a carbon nanotube is a graphene sheet wrapped into a cylinder .",
    "the energy dispersion relation of the zigzag edge states appears only between the two dirac points , and the localization length ( @xmath1 ) of the edge state depends on the distance from the dirac point in the @xmath0-space . in particular , at the center of the two dirac points , the wave function of the edge state has amplitude only at the edge sites ( @xmath2 ) . while @xmath1 becomes infinite at the dirac points where the edge states connect to extended states continuously .",
    "thus , by changing @xmath0 due to the aharanov - bohm ( ab ) effect for the magnetic flux penetrating a hollow core of nanotube ,  @xcite an extended state at the dirac point can be transfered into an edge state and vice versa ( localization - delocalization ( ld ) transition ) . in the previous paper ,  @xcite we showed that the ld transition is possible for large diameter zigzag nanotubes and",
    "it can be observed by the conductance measurement . in this paper , we first show analytical calculations of the length and diameter dependence of the ld transition , and then try to explain the phenomena intuitively using a continuous model .",
    "we will show that the ld transition can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements in the presence of magnetic field around 20 tesla .",
    "since the edge states exist near the fermi energy , the real - space image of the edge states is observed by stm experiments .",
    "@xcite the local density of state ( ldos ) is observed by sts at a step edge of the zigzag type on a vicinal surface of graphite .",
    "@xcite the cylindrical structure of carbon nanotubes is suitable for the study of the ab effect . the ab oscillations and the period of the fundamental unit of magnetic flux ( @xmath3 ) were observed in multi - wall nanotubes .",
    "@xcite since ab flux breaks time - reversal symmetry , a splitting of the degenerated van hove singularity for k and k points is observed .",
    "@xcite the splitting was observed as a shift of the first - subband magneto - absorption peak in semiconducting single - wall nanotubes  @xcite and as a splitting of the peak position of the van hove singularities in the conductance measurement .",
    "@xcite these experiments are intended to observe the ab effect for the extended states near the fermi level .",
    "the ab measurement by stm / sts for the edge states not only gives a direct evidence of the edge states in zigzag carbon nanotubes but also can clarify the topological property of the edge states .",
    "an important property of the edge state is that the wave function of the edge state has an amplitude only on one of the two sublattices ( a and b ) in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "when we consider a pseudo 1/2 spin whose up and down spins represent the relative amplitude on the a and b sublattices , respectively , an edge state can be described by a pseudo - spin polarized state accumulated at the edge .",
    "this situation is similar to the spin hall effect  @xcite in which the spin - orbit interaction induces the spin polarization at the edge of semiconductor materials by `` the lorentz force for spin '' in the presence of the electronic current . in this paper",
    ", we will show that a similar lorentz force acts for the pseudo spin in the graphene system in which the lattice defects can be understood by the time - reversal - symmetric gauge field and by corresponding pseudo - magnetic field .    in sec .",

    "@xmath5 is also quantized by the boundary condition in the direction of the axis of the tube for a finite length @xmath11 . in the previous paper ,",

    "the ab flux along the axis of a tube shifts the electronic state from the k point to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is number of the flux quantum . in the presence of a uniform magnetic field of @xmath52[t ] , @xmath51 for ( n,0 ) zigzag tube is expressed by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the cross sectional area of the nanotube , @xmath55[t @xmath56 , and @xmath57[t ] .",

    "<S> two delocalized states of metallic zigzag carbon nanotubes near the dirac point can be localized by the aharanov - bohm magnetic field around 20 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the localization on the length and diameter of the nanotubes shows that the localization - delocalization transition can be observed for 2 nm diameter tube . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of the localization is explained in terms of the deformation - induced gauge field , which shows a topological nature of the localization . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the delocalized states to the localized states can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> a similarity between the transition and the spin hall effect is discussed . </S>"
