    "extreme value statistics is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of the tails of distributions .",
    "it is well - known that the distribution of extreme values for a sample of @xmath2i.i.d .",
    "( independent , identically distributed ) random variables converge ( as @xmath3 ) to a few limiting distributions depending on the tail behavior of the parent population , namely fisher - tippett - gumbel , weibull and fisher - tippett - frechet @xcite",
    ". however , the onset of this finite sample size scaling behavior is quite slow , and therefore requires very large samples to converge .",
    "this is the primary reason why astronomy has seen few applications of evs to date .",
    "the emergence of dedicated wide angle galaxy surveys , such as sdss @xcite , has made possible an increase in statistics , making galaxy samples in the sdss redshift survey just large enough to attempt an analysis of the finite sample size scaling for all galaxies .",
    "here we chose to study the distribution of maximal luminosities of galaxies , since the galaxy luminosity distribution per volume or luminosity function ( lf ) is one of the most basic statistic measured in galaxy surveys .",
    "this function has been well described by a gamma distribution or so - called schechter function @xcite , functionally similar ( and motivated by ) the theoretically derived press - schechter formula @xcite , with a power law distribution at the faint end and an exponentially falling tail at the bright end .",
    "when galaxies are grouped according to their morphologies , their respective lfs seem to belong to different classes , including bell - shaped distributions as well as gamma functions of different shape and scale parameters @xcite .",
    "current modeling of the conditional lf ( clf ) to galaxy clusters in dark matter halos of a certain mass include the presence of central or brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) with a log - normal clf , while the rest of the galaxies ( satellites ) are given a power law clf with a finite cut at high luminosities @xcite .",
    "special attention has always been paid to the high luminosity tail of the all galaxy lf .",
    "bcgs are the brightest of the old populations of red elliptical galaxies found in the high density cores of galaxy clusters are thought to have their progenitors formed at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) , and then have undergone a set of dry mergers in their life history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their importance lies in the low scatter of their luminosities , making them useful as standard candles @xcite .",
    "several studies have been made to elucidate whether bcgs are the extremes of a red or early type galaxies lf or they come from other luminosity distribution . in order to answer the question ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite investigated the statistics derived from the first and second brightest luminosities ( and the gap between them ) in galaxy clusters .",
    "their results based on smaller samples has been confirmed by @xcite , who found that the luminosity gap between first and second - ranked galaxies is substantially larger than what can be explained with an exponentially decaying luminosity function . on the other hand , @xcite shuffled the data to combine all galaxies of clusters to form a composite cluster , finding that bcgs in high luminosity clusters are not drawn from the luminosity distribution of all red cluster galaxies , while bcgs in less luminous clusters are consistent to be the statistical extreme .",
    "these previous studies were mainly directed toward the luminosity statistics within galaxy clusters . in this paper",
    "we will study galaxy luminosities as a whole , and the sampling will not be restricted to the maximal luminosities from galaxy clusters .",
    "this will keep the sample size large enough for studying the finite - size scaling behavior .    since evs is well known only for i.i.d .",
    "variables , one approach we will follow is trying to minimize the correlations between luminosities and positions by selecting the maximal luminosities from batches or blocks of galaxies in elongated regions or pencil beams along the line of sight , and defined by the footprint of the healpix tessellation on the sky @xcite . as we shall discuss , such elongated cells combined with the short range correlations in luminosities make possible an analysis of evs based on the assumption that the luminosities approximate well an i.i.d . behavior .",
    "this approach allows us to show a working example designed to mimic the standard block maxima sampling method from evs of time series , but also generalizing it to the case of variable block size , as discussed later in this paper .",
    "another simpler approach we will use for comparing with the previous method is the random sampling of the luminosity parent distribution in batches of fixed size .",
    "these are new approaches for testing the bright end of the overall lf , and inherently different from previous studies that considered testing the luminosity extremes in galaxy clusters .    within the i.i.d .",
    "framework , the shape of the galaxy luminosity function is important for the evs . the exponential tail in the high luminosity end of the lf would imply a fisher - tippett - gumbel ( ftg ) evs distribution , with corrections for the finite sample sizes depending on the power law at lower luminosities @xcite . in this analysis",
    "we will test the agreement with these expectations , and the analysis will also reveal whether or not a sharp cutoff at a high but finite luminosity exists .",
    "we emphasize that even though the sdss sample is large , the residual from the ftg distribution can be explained only when we consider the corrections due to both the finite size of the samples of each healpix pencil beam and the distribution present in the sample sizes ( the number of galaxies in a cone is finite and varies from cone to cone ) .",
    "thus we have here a pioneering example where a generalized finite size scaling ( including sample - size distribution ) is relevant in the data analysis .",
    "the arguments and results will be presented in the following order . in section",
    "[ sec : samplecreation ] we describe our galaxy sample .",
    "section [ lumfun ] shows the fits to the galaxy luminosity distributions and functions .",
    "section [ section : footprintcreation ] explains the construction of the pencil beams and distribution of galaxy counts inside them .",
    "section [ section : theoryofevs ] contains a discussion of the basic concepts of extreme value statistics with emphasis on possible deviations from the expected limit distributions due to finite number of the galaxies in the pencil beams and , furthermore , due to the pencil - to - pencil fluctuations in the galaxy counts . in section [ section : distributionofmaximalluminosities ]",
    "we present the results about the distribution of maximal luminosities with the conclusion that within the uncertainties coming from the finiteness of samples and from the sample  size distribution , the fisher  tippett  gumbel distribution gives an excellent fit .",
    "the final remarks and discussion can be found in section [ disc ] .    along this paper",
    ", we use the ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) = ( 0.7 , 0.3 , 0.7 , -1 ) cosmology .",
    "in this paper we use photometric and spectroscopic data of galaxies from sdss - dr8 @xcite , available in a ms - sql server database that can be queried online via casjobs , and analyzed directly inside the database using an integrated cosmological functions library @xcite .",
    "the galaxies studied were the dr7 legacy spectroscopically - targeted main galaxy sample ( mgs ) @xcite , as well as the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite .",
    "the sky footprint of the clean spectroscopic survey builds up from a complicated geometry defined by sectors , which cover a fractional area @xmath9 of the whole sky .",
    "redshift incompleteness arises from the fact that two 3  aperture spectroscopic fibers can not be put together closer than 55  in the same plate . as a strategy , denser region in the sky",
    "are given a greater number of overlapping plates .",
    "however , only @xmath1093@xmath11 ( mgs ) and @xmath1095@xmath11 ( lrg ) of the initial galaxies photometrically targeted have their spectra taken .",
    "several selection cuts and flags were applied in order to have a clean sample .",
    "we selected only science primary objects classified as galaxies and appearing in calibrated images having the photometric status flag .",
    "we used the score quantity as a measure of the field quality with respect to the sky flux and the width of the point spread function , and selected only the fields in the range @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we neglected individual objects with bad deblending flags ( peakcenter , deblend@xmath13nopeak , notchecked ) and interpolation problems ( psf@xmath13flux@xmath13interp , bad@xmath13counts@xmath13error ) or suspicious detections ( saturated noprofile ) , as well with problems in the spectrum ( zwarning ) .    with respect to the mgs , they were observed as a magnitude limited sample , with a targeted r - band petrosian apparent magnitude cut of @xmath14 , and a redshift distribution peaking at @xmath15 .",
    "we further restrict this sample to safe cuts of @xmath16=[13.5,17.65]$ ] .",
    "the lower limit is set due to the arising cross talk from close fibers in the spectrographs when they carry light from very bright galaxies , whereas the upper limit safely avoids the slight variations in the targeting algorithm of the limiting apparent magnitude around 17.77 over the sky .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : absmagvsredshift ] , we chose galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath17=[0.065,0.22]$ ] , since at redshift lower than @xmath18 , the galaxy high luminosity tail becomes incomplete ( due to imposing the apparent magnitude cut at @xmath19 ) .",
    "this left us with @xmath20 mgs galaxies in a volume of @xmath21\\times f_{a } = 0.559 { \\rm gpc}^{3}$ ] .",
    "with respect to the lrgs , they where selected from color cuts ( in g - r v / s r - i space ) in such a way that are traced across redshift as an old population of luminous and passively evolving red early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this was done by modeling them with an old stellar population spectral template from pegase @xcite .",
    "we use lrgs in the cut i sample , which was built to be almost a volume limited sample up to redshift 0.38 with an r - band petrosian apparent magnitude cut of @xmath22 .",
    "we apply a safe redshift window of @xmath17=[0.20,0.38]$ ] since , at lower redshift , the color selection cuts admit blue galaxies belonging to the mgs .",
    "we further constraint this lrgs by considering galaxies whose r - band surface light profile can be modeled mainly as a devacouleurs profiles ( as in elliptical galaxies ) more than an exponential disc ( fracdev @xmath23 ) @xcite . we also use the r - band concentration index r90/r50 @xcite to select mostly elliptical galaxies ( r90/r50@xmath24 ) .",
    "this left us with @xmath2552579 lrgs in a volume of @xmath26 .    since our samples span broad redshift and time intervals , it is crucial to apply a ( k+evolution)-correction to @xmath27 in the form @xmath27 = @xmath28 - @xmath29 - @xmath30 - @xmath31 , which brings all the galaxies to a common @xmath32 restframe .",
    "the k - corrections for the mgs were calculated by modeling each galaxy spectrum as the closest non negative linear combination of spectra drawn from the @xcite templates ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we applied a simple average evolution correction as a linear function of redshift , derived by @xcite as e(z)=-qz ( q=1.62 for r - band , q=4.22 for u - band ) . for the lrg case",
    ", we used the k+evolution correction derived from the pegase template .",
    "this was modeled as a 4th order polynomial in redshift , as used in @xcite and @xcite , where k(z)+e(z)=@xmath33 + 5.59@xmath34 - 24.0@xmath35 + 36.0@xmath36 .",
    "we finally checked the first 1000 images of galaxies for each sample ranked by brightest r - band petrosian absolute magnitude , and rejected the objects whose photometry appears to be ruined by the leaked light of a nearby star .",
    "also , objects where rejected in the case when the petrosian magnitude was more different than 0.8 magnitudes compared with the model magnitude .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) , defined as the distribution of galaxy luminosities ( or magnitudes ) per volume , has been for long well studied as a basic statistic .",
    "since galaxy surveys are generally apparent magnitude limited at the faint end , the lf differs from the luminosity distribution ( ld ) in that the former can not be obtained from a simple raw histogram of the luminosity data points as lds are .",
    "in fact , the faint luminosity tail of lds is incomplete , as faint galaxies can be observed only at close enough distances ( malmquist bias ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the brightest galaxies can generally be observed over the whole redshift limits of the survey . as a consequence ,",
    "lfs are identical to lds at the bright end ( except for a scale factor equal to the survey s volume @xmath37 ) but start to depart from each other at a departure luminosity @xmath38 ( specified next ) .",
    "the important link between lfs and lds is that , since they behave the same way at the bright end , we can study lfs in this regime by instead doing the sampling and evs on the ld of the individual data points .",
    "this is the strategy followed in this paper , which works as long as we sample galaxies with luminosities close enough to or brighter than @xmath38 .    in order to correct the incompleteness of low luminosity galaxies , we construct lfs by adding more weight to these galaxies , as used in the vmax method @xcite , where each @xmath39-th galaxy is assigned a weight @xmath40 .",
    "here we note that , given the particular @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] intervals for the survey , the @xmath39-th galaxy found at @xmath42 could be observed only within a maximum comoving volume @xmath43 inside the overall volume @xmath37 of the survey .",
    "if the @xmath39-th galaxy of apparent magnitude @xmath44 , k - correction @xmath45 , evolution correction @xmath46 and at a luminosity distance @xmath47 were to have limiting apparent magnitudes @xmath48 , then it should be moved to a limiting luminosity distance given by    @xmath49    hence , the maximum volume is defined by the biggest interval of @xmath50 inside which a galaxy can appear in the survey : @xmath51 \\times f_{a } , \\label{eq : vmax}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as eq .",
    "[ eq : dlumlim ] defines @xmath52 in an implicit way , we solve for it iteratively .",
    "the weights @xmath53 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : absmagvsvmax ] . the departure magnitudes separating the complete ( @xmath54 ) and incomplete ( @xmath55 ) parts of the samples take the values of @xmath56 = -22.63 ( lrg ) and @xmath56 = -22.43 ( mgs ) .",
    "thus , the distribution of weights looks bimodal , where the complete part of the sample creates the spike at @xmath54 , and the incomplete part forms the broad tail .",
    "note that the incomplete part presents at the beginning a nearly linear trend given by @xmath57 ( derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : dlumlim ] ) .",
    "the part of the trend that departs and seems extending into the high @xmath58 region , on the other hand , is composed of galaxies whose apparent magnitude is very close to the limiting apparent magnitude cut @xmath59 of the survey .",
    "a non - parametric lf can be then easily estimated using a vmax weighted histogram in the form    @xmath60    the extra weight @xmath61 takes into account the incompleteness of the target selection algorithm for spectroscopic follow up . the error @xmath62 is estimated by using jackknife sampling of 38 regions about 200 sqdeg each .    the luminosity functions and distributions and their fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumfun ] , and tables [ table : fittingparameterslumfunction ] and [ table : fittingparameterslumdistribution ] contain the fitting parameters .",
    "for the mgs samples , we use a generalized gamma as a fitting function , which results in the known schechter profile @xcite when @xmath63 : @xmath64 \\rbrace dl .",

    "[ fig : lumfun ] , we can see that the generalized gamma function provides a better fitting for the mgs lf than the schechter fit .",
    "indeed , @xmath74 fits much better the high luminosity tail , and is similar to the value found by @xcite ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "our faint end slope ( @xmath76 ) is steeper compared to their value ( @xmath77 ) , although we are fitting in a different magnitude interval and to a galaxy sample of different magnitude and redshift selection cuts .",
    "the errors in the magnitude have little influence in the value of the fitted parameters .",
    "as shown in @xcite , bigger magnitude errors might decrease the fitted value of @xmath78 .",
    "however , they showed that the inclusion of the @xmath790.05 rms errors on the magnitude in sdss provided discrepancies in the fitting parameters generally smaller than their statistical errors .",
    "the lrg sample was made to include the brightest early types .",
    "therefore , they are naturally better fitted with an extreme value distribution ( evd ) or its special case the gumbel where @xmath1 ( see sec . [ section : theoryofevs ] ) :    @xmath80 ) ^{-1/\\xi } ,    1 + \\xi [ \\frac{l - l_{\\mu}}{l_{\\sigma } } ]   > 0 . &",

    "the lrgs were built to be a complete ( volume limited ) sample , but some scattered lower luminosity galaxies passed the color cuts and contaminated it ( fig . [ fig : absmagvsredshift ] ) .",
    "therefore , we only fit the lf up to the completeness limit @xmath83 as explained earlier .",
    ".luminosity function fitting parameters .",

    ", the empirical corrections are obtained by standardizing the maximal luminosities and subtracting them from the standard gumbel distribution . for plotting the theoretical corrections with an amplitude given in eq . , we need appropriate values of @xmath89 and @xmath78 . as explained in sec . [",
    "sec : finitesizecorrection ] , these fitting parameters should come from fitting the high luminosity tail .",
    "therefore , the fitted values of the full ld in table [ table : fittingparameterslumdistribution ] should not be used . in our case ,",
    "[ fig : lumfun ] shows that the full luminosity function fit ( table [ table : fittingparameterslumfunction ] ) is a much better approximation of the high luminosity tail , and we use it instead .",
    "[ fig : simulations ] shows that the empirical corrections for mgs galaxies do have the same shape as the theoretical first order correction .",
    "the amplitude of the function approximately agrees , but we found that the empirical amplitude does not increase significantly when @xmath2 decreases .",
    "the explanation is that as @xmath2 becomes smaller , we start sampling the maximal luminosities from the bulk of the luminosity distribution instead of its high luminosity tail . of course , the departure of lf and ld in this regime makes the lf fitting parameters @xmath89 and @xmath78 no longer valid for calculating the theoretical corrections",
    ". a better fit could be attained from @xmath89 and @xmath78 parameters obtained by fitting the ld to slightly fainted magnitudes than the departing magnitude @xmath90 .",
    "the other consideration is the fact that we might need adding the next term in the correction , which could be important if @xmath2 is small .    in the lrg case ,",
    "we can not find a systematic correction , but just noise .",
    "this is in agreement with the expected behavior as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : finitesizecorrection ] , since the gumbel parent distribution is a fixed point in the renormalization theory used for calculating the corrections @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the maximal luminosities ( in magnitude space ) for the healpix - based method are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magdistribution ] . here ,",
    "the low luminosity tails of the maximal distributions reach farther into the low luminosity regions ( around @xmath91 ) than in the random sampling method .",
    "the reason is that some of the healpix cells have very low values of @xmath2 .",
    "the maximal luminosities , however , are mostly sampled in the region where @xmath92 . as this is the high luminosity region where the ld and lf mostly coincide ,",
    "all the results obtained from analyzing the bright end of the ld can be also extended and associated with the lf .",
    "[ fig : shape - corrections ] presents the distributions of maximal luminosities ( in luminosity space ) observed in a healpix cell for the three studied resolutions ( @xmath93 ) and for the two galaxy populations .",
    "the distributions on this figure are scaled to zero mean and unite deviation in order to compare them with the similarly scaled gumbel distribution .",
    "the theoretical first order correction coming from the finite - size ( finite @xmath2 ) effects , together with the correction to the i.i.d .",
    "limit distribution coming from the distribution @xmath94 of the galaxy counts are also shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : shape - corrections ] . except for the cases of @xmath95 , where the statistical noise has larger amplitude than the corrections",
    ", it appears that the sum of this two corrections is of the order of the residuals and have the same functional shape . at the highest order resolution of the maps ( @xmath96 ) , however , the batch sizes are rather small and the finite - size corrections become large , and appear to be in accord with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the lrgs are special in the sense that finite size effects do not emerge in their evs , because the parent distribution itself is gumbel , as explained in [ sec : finitesizecorrection ] .",
    "consequently the only correction to the limit distribution comes from the variable batch size @xmath2 , in agreement what we see in the fourth column in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape - corrections ] .",
    "we carried out simulations as well in order to confirm our theoretical results by modeling the empirical situation with less noise . sampling the fitted functions of the empirical parent and sample size distributions with high statistics ( @xmath97 ) we get smoother histograms .",
    "as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : shape - corrections ] , the simulated corrections are indeed a good model for the empirical corrections , and support the theoretical expectations as we can observe the convergence toward the theoretical curve for increasing @xmath98 .",
    "studying extreme statistics may have several outcomes .",
    "one may discover that the objects under consideration have a well defined i.i.d .",
    "type extreme value distribution .",
    "this may then lead to the conclusion ( provided the distribution is of the weibull type - i.e. the shape parameter is negative ) that the underlying objects have an intrinsic cutoff in size . in our case",
    "the luminosities have an i.i.d .",
    "evs , but the shape parameter @xmath0 is in the positive range and very close to zero .",
    "thus our conclusion here is that the mgs and lrg luminosities do not have an upper cutoff .    as far as the lrgs",
    "are concerned , we should note that the same conclusion about the absence of an upper cutoff can be reached by a straightforward fit to the high end of the luminosity function . on the other hand ,",
    "there are difficulties with the agreement of the schechter fitting to the bright end of the mgs lf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here the evs analysis suggests that the root of the problem may be a small positive tail parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this possibility was also noted by @xcite with their proposal of the generalized double power law fitting function for the lf .",
    "of course , the conclusion that mgs galaxies do not have a finite luminosity cutoff and @xmath0 has a small positive value is valid only if the methods used in the study are robust against possible corrections arising in the analysis .",
    "uncertainties may come from the finite size of the sample , from the distribution of the number of objects in the sample , and from the correlations among the objects .",
    "we have taken care of the finite - size effects by including the first order corrections in the limit distributions and , furthermore , we handled the fluctuations in the sample size by explicitly calculating their effect for the i.i.d .",
    "case .    as evidenced by figs .",
    "[ fig : simulations ] and [ fig : shape - corrections ] , a parameter free comparison with the data suggests good agreement with the corrections ( for the case @xmath1 ) being the right order of magnitude as well as of the right shape .",
    "thus , we believe that the above effects are in agreement with the conclusion about the absence of upper cutoff in the luminosity . of course , the agreement proved to be valid when the fitting parameters come from a parent distribution fitted in the high luminosity tail , as expected from the theory .",
    "if the batch size @xmath2 decreases and the peak of the maximal luminosities moves into the lower luminosity region , agreement with theory should obtained only if the fitting is performed in an extended luminosity interval considering the lower luminosity values .",
    "since the lf is basically constructed from a weighted ld , the strategy of sampling the maxima from the bright luminosity tail of the ld ( where both the lf and ld coincide ) was a key part of our analysis .",
    "thus it would be of interest for future studies to develop an extended extreme value theory , where the all data points coming from a given class of parent distributions are each counted with different weights .",
    "such a theory may help in analyzing data sets where there is incompleteness even at the tail where the extremes are sampled from .",
    "the correlations pose a more difficult problem .",
    "for one dimensional systems , it is known from the studies of @xmath99 type signals that the correlations are irrelevant if they are `` weak '' @xcite .",
    "weak means that the integral of the correlation function is finite .",
    "the effectively one - dimensionality of the pencil beam geometry considered in this paper allows the application of the weakness criteria for the luminosity correlations .",
    "indeed , one may argue that the luminosity correlations @xmath100 are proportional to the density correlations @xmath101 which , at large distances decay as @xmath102 .",
    "the one - dimensional integral of this type of correlations is convergent , thus we believe the weakness criteria is satisfied , and our conclusion is not affected by the correlations [ note that any power relationship between the correlations ( @xmath103 ) will also satisfy the criteria of weakness provided @xmath104",
    ".    we can thus conclude that the extreme value statistics of galaxy luminosities is i.i.d .",
    "type with zero or small positive shape parameter , and this conclusion takes into account the finite - size of the samples , the galaxy - number fluctuations in the pencil beams , and the large - distance spatial correlations among luminosities .",

    "<S> maximal luminosities are sampled from batches consisting of elongated pencil beams in the radial direction of sight . for the mgs </S>",
    "<S> , results suggest a small and positive tail index @xmath0 , effectively ruling out the possibility of having a finite maximum cutoff luminosity , and implying that the luminosity distribution function may decay as a power law at the high luminosity end . </S>",
    "<S> assuming , however , @xmath1 , a non - parametric comparison of the maximal luminosities with the fisher - tippett - gumbel distribution ( limit distribution for variables distributed by the schechter fit ) indicates a good agreement provided uncertainties arising both from the finite batch size and from the batch size distribution are accounted for . for a volume limited sample of lrgs , results show that they can be described as being the extremes of a luminosity distribution with an exponentially decaying tail , provided the uncertainties related to batch - size distribution are taken care of . </S>"
