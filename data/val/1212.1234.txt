    "the central puzzle of galaxy evolution is how baryons fall into galaxies and turn into stars . understanding the mass assembly history of galaxies is a critical element for solving this puzzle .",
    "galaxies can be generally divided into two populations : those actively forming stars and those that are quiescent with relatively little star formation .",
    "observationally , these two types of galaxy have differing colors corresponding to different regions in color - magnitude diagrams @xcite .",
    "the star - forming galaxies are said to occupy the `` blue cloud '' ( bc ) while the passive galaxies occupy the``red sequence '' ( rs ) .",
    "similar bimodal distributions are also seen in their morphologies , spectral types , metallicities , and star formation rates @xcite .",
    "morphologically most galaxies in the rs are elliptical / s0 galaxies , and galaxies in the bc are disk or irregular / peculiar galaxies .",
    "this bimodality is observed over a very wide redshift range up to @xmath10 @xcite . in a color  stellar mass diagram , red galaxies appear to be much more massive than blue ones .",
    "formation of massive red galaxies can not be accounted for by any simple blue - to - red galaxy evolution path .",
    "many authors @xcite suggest that galaxy merging is the only way of forming massive red galaxies .",
    "there are probably more than two merging scenarios : two blue galaxies can merge to trigger a burst to star formation and eventually form a massive red galaxy , or two blue galaxies can evolve to red galaxies , then undergo a dry merging to form a massive galaxy . a census of red and blue galaxies at different redshifts is needed to constrain how galaxies migrate from the bc to the rs .",
    "redshifts are essential for studying galaxy populations .",
    "early spectroscopic galaxy surveys @xcite usually obtained several hundreds of redshifts .",
    "these surveys concluded that strong galaxy evolution seen in faint @xmath7-band galaxy counts was mainly due to blue galaxy evolution since @xmath11 with red galaxies showing little or no evolution .",
    "@xcite constructed luminosity functions for elliptical galaxies in @xmath12 with the deep1 redshift sample and argued that they saw only passive luminosity evolution but no change in number density for elliptical galaxies since @xmath11 .",
    "these early redshift surveys are too small to have significant statistics for massive red galaxies , which can also suffer a large cosmic variance @xcite .",
    "recently several large optical redshift surveys have been carried out on 8 m class telescopes including vvds @xcite , @xmath13cosmos @xcite , and deep2 @xcite , each with more than 10000 redshifts available for galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "these redshift surveys are highly complete for blue galaxies up to @xmath15 because the [ ] @xmath163727 line can be observed . measuring redshifts for red galaxies is more difficult because there are only absorption lines available in most of their spectra , and at high redshifts , only luminous red galaxies can have redshifts measured in these existing redshift surveys .",
    "therefore optical redshift samples suffer severe bias against red galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "most studies of evolution of galaxy populations have used optically - selected samples .",
    "several groups @xcite used photometric or photometric / spectroscopic combined redshift samples to study evolution of red galaxies and found that the number density of red galaxies increases from @xmath11 to @xmath17 .",
    "this is consistent with a migration of galaxy population from bc to rs .",
    "however , as mentioned above , optically - selected samples are biased against red galaxies at @xmath18 , where even @xmath19 band probes the rest - frame uv .",
    "near - ir selected galaxy samples permit detection of red galaxies with lower luminosities or at higher redshifts @xcite than optically - selected samples .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath8-band light of a galaxy comes mainly from m and k stars and traces underlying stellar mass@xcite .",
    "therefore a rest - frame @xmath8-band selected galaxy sample is equivalent to a mass - selected sample unbiased against either red or blue galaxies , permitting fair statistics for both galaxy populations .",
    "however , early ground - based near infrared ( nir ) surveys have been ineffective because of small format ir array camera and high nir sky background .",
    "large - format nir array cameras on 48 m class telescopes now allow deep nir surveys with both wide coverage and faint limiting magnitude @xmath2025mag @xcite .",
    "most deep @xmath8-band surveys focus on formation and evolution of passive red galaxies with @xmath21m@xmath22 at @xmath23 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "local @xmath8-band galaxy surveys detect early type galaxies with stellar masses as low as 10@xmath2 m@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite estimated the local stellar mass function down to m@xmath24=10@xmath25m@xmath22 , and found that the local stellar mass function has a very steep slope at the lower mass end .",
    "most relevant to the present study , @xcite carried out @xmath8-band imaging in the extended groth strip region with @xmath26 .",
    "the limiting stellar mass for their @xmath8-selected sample is @xmath2710@xmath28m@xmath22 at @xmath29 . formation and evolution of lower mass red galaxies since @xmath11 has not yet been well studied .    the infrared array camera ( irac ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "can perform very fast scanning of the ir sky with great depth .",
    "the irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m bands probe the rest nir for galaxies at @xmath18 .",

    "a galaxy with @xmath32=23.9$]mag has a typical @xmath35-band magnitude of 26 @xcite , too faint for spectroscopy even with 8 m class telescopes .",
    "photometric redshifts are essential in studying faint mid - infrared ( mir ) selected galaxies .    using photometric redshifts is inevitable in studying red galaxy evolution . with large format ccd cameras available on 68 m class telescopes ,",
    "deep multi - wavelength photometric data become available .",
    "these data permit measurement of accurate photometric redshifts for much larger samples of faint galaxies than can be obtained spectroscopically .",
    "a difficulty is that for galaxies at higher redshifts , the dominant features in galaxy seds , for example the balmer/4000  break , shift out of the visible band . including intermediate - band photometry",
    "can improve the photometric redshifts @xcite , and accuracy can be further improved by extending the wavelength coverage to the nir .",
    "recently the newfirm intermediate band survey , including 3 bands in the 1.2@xmath0 m window and 2 bands in the 1.6@xmath0 m window , was completed with the noao 4 m telescope in search of passive galaxies at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the relative redshift uncertainty @xmath37 for their photometric redshifts is 12% for the @xmath8-selected galaxies .    to extend sed fitting to the _ spitzer _  irac bands",
    ", photometric redshift estimation must overcome a new challenge : variation of point spread function ( psf ) from ultraviolet to the mid - infrared .",
    "traditionally , photometric redshift estimation @xcite is performed by fitting a set of templates to an observed galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) obtained in a multi - wavelength photometric survey .",
    "psf variation in different bands may distort the observed seds @xcite , and anyway we have poor knowledge of galaxy sed templates in the mir @xcite .",
    "artificial neural networks ( ann@xmath13 , collister & lahav 2004 ) is an alternative redshift estimation method .",
    "ann@xmath13 has several advantages for mir - selected galaxy samples : it does not require any knowledge of galaxy sed templates , and the resulting photometric redshifts are not affected by photometry offsets caused by psf variation or any other systematic offset in different bands .",
    "ann@xmath13 uses a calibration sample to set up an empirical relation between spectroscopic redshifts and observed galaxy properties .",
    "input parameters can be anything including color , flux , size , and even digital morphological parameters .",
    "all this method requires is that input and calibration samples have the same filter set for photometry and cover same input parameters and redshift ranges .",
    "though ann@xmath13 can not measure any redshifts beyond the range of the calibration sample , @xcite showed that ann@xmath13 photometric redshifts for a mir - selected sample have much smaller scatter than those derived with the sed template methods .",
    "this paper presents a multi - wavelength study of a complete 3.6@xmath0m - selected galaxy sample at @xmath38 in the extended groth strip region .",

    "deep 24  imaging is available in the egs region @xcite with the 5@xmath48 limiting flux density of @xmath49@xmath0jy , providing a good prior to identify the blended herschel spire sources .",
    "the actual fir photometry catalog in the acs covered area was extracted using the mips 24@xmath0 m catalog as the prior with the method described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived fir luminosities for herschel sources in the region by fitting templates to their ir seds .",
    "the egs also has a large number of spectroscopic redshifts available @xcite .. the aegis datasets include one of the deepest irac surveys , covering 10@xmath442  with @xmath509ks exposure time .",
    "the irac observations , data reduction , and photometry were presented by @xcite and later with more aggressive source extraction by @xcite .",
    "the latter authors found 80% completeness at limiting flux densities of 1.8 and 2.0@xmath0jy respectively at 3.6  and 4.5  compared to @xmath2760% completeness at these flux densities found by @xcite .",
    "for the current paper , we have restricted our sample to the hst acs imaging region ( 10@xmath441 , @xcite ) , where there are generally deeper visible and nir photometric data available .",
    "our preliminary sample includes all objects in this region with flux density @xmath51@xmath0jy in the @xcite catalog .",
    "this limit selects galaxies over a wide redshift range and also a few stars .",
    "there are 23327 objects in the preliminary sample .",
    "the visible and nir photometric data for the sample are summarized in table  1 .",
    "there are 18 bands from @xmath52 to 8  that are useful for photometric redshifts .",
    "figure  [ f : nb ] shows a histogram of the number of photometric points available per object . about 96% of the objects have photometry in at least 5 bands , and 62% of the objects have at least 15-band data .",
    "as table  1 shows , however , some of the visible and nir bands are redundant .",
    "for example , there are four versions of @xmath35-band imaging with various depths . in redundant bands , we used a @xmath48-weighted mean to combine photometry to give a single photometric value with maximum signal - to - noise ratio in each band . after combining redundant bands ,",
    "there are 12 wavelengths available in the @xmath52 to 8  range . in the visible range @xmath53 , the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cfhtls ) provides a well - calibrated photometry system , and we transformed all photometry in this wavelength range into the cfthls system .",
    "this study focuses on galaxy population at @xmath3 to take advantage of the large number of spectroscopic redshifts available .",
    "therefore the preliminary all-@xmath13 sample needs to be refined by rejecting foreground stars and background galaxies at @xmath54 .",
    "a set of simple color criteria can separate the background galaxies . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the irac @xmath32-[4.5]$ ] color is a function of redshift ( figure  [ f : cz ] ) : galaxies with @xmath32-[4.5]<0 $ ] are at @xmath55 and galaxies with @xmath32-[4.5]>0 $ ] are at @xmath56.-[4.5]=0 $ ] is weakly dependent on galaxy spectral types with red galaxies having @xmath57 and blue galaxies having @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite proposed a more stringent color - dependent criterion to separate galaxies at z=1.3 : [ 3.6]-[4.5]=0.12([3.6]-[8.0])-0.07 ] this is because 1.6  bump in galaxy seds shifts through the irac bands at @xmath59 .",
    "several groups have used this sed feature to select galaxies at @xmath60 for _ spitzer _  irs spectroscopy with a nearly 100% successful identification rate @xcite .",
    "some rest - frame uv - selected galaxies at @xmath61 such as bm / bx galaxies and lbgs , however , are too young to have developed the 1.6  bump @xcite , and these galaxies may have @xmath32-[4.5]<0 $ ] even with @xmath54 .",
    "we therefore need an additional criterion to reject these young blue galaxies .",
    "we used an optical - mir color - color diagram ( @xmath62 vs @xmath63 $ ] , figure  [ f : ri_ch1 ] ) for classification .",
    "figure  [ f : ri_ch1 ] shows that stars , galaxies , at @xmath64 , and galaxies at @xmath56 occupy different regions .",
    "thus the three criteria for selection of the 3.6  galaxy sample are : @xmath65-[4.6]<0\\ ] ] @xmath66)+0.015\\ ] ] @xmath67)+0.5\\ ] ] criterion  1 removes background galaxies with a normal 1.6bump , criterion  2 rejects young , blue galaxies at @xmath56 , and criterion  3 rejects stars . criterion  1 is not as stringent as that proposed by @xcite for the same purpose , thus may reduce the bias by the color cut , but will include galaxies at z@xmath681.3 in the preliminary sample .",
    "these galaxies will be rejected from the sample after we apply criterion  2 .",
    "criterion  2 is very similar to the bzk selection for galaxies at z@xmath272 , but used here to reject these galaxies .",
    "@xcite used their sed - fiting photometric redshift sample to demonstrate that galaxies can be well separated at z=1.3 in the same r@xmath69i vs r@xmath69[3.6 ] diagram .    by combining both criterion  1 and 2",
    ", we can effectively reject galaxies at z@xmath11.25 while reduce the bias caused by applying only one color criterion .",
    "the final sample for photometric redshift estimation includes objects in the hst / acs area of the egs meeting the above three criteria and with @xmath32<23.15 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ f : rich1_z ] confirms that our sample selection does not have any strong bias against either quiescent or star forming galaxies .",
    "there are 12890 galaxies in the final sample .",
    "figure  [ f : rich1_seq ] illustrates successive application of the color criteria . in our preliminary sample ,",
    "95% of the objects have both @xmath35 and @xmath19 band detections and can be selected by all three criteria .",
    "of 1297 sources missing either @xmath35 or @xmath19 , 1185 have 4.5  counterparts which we will be able to classify with relation  1 : 387 with [ 3.6]@xmath69[4.5]@xmath700 are included in the sample and 798 with [ 3.6]@xmath69[4.5]@xmath10 are reject .",
    "the remaining 112 sources can not be definitively excluded and are kept in the sample , but their photometric redshifts will be more uncertain than sources having better wavelength coverage .    our selection does not particularly discriminate against agns , but agns with power - law seds in the mid - infrared band . objects with strong hot dust emission are called `` power - law '' objects with very much red color of [ 3.6]@xmath69[4.5]@xmath10 even at z@xmath701 @xcite .",
    "thus their 3.6@xmath0 m flux densities for these power - law objects are mainly from hot dust emission , but no longer trace their stellar mass . @xcite found that number of power - law objects is less than 1% of @xmath1l@xmath24 galaxies in an 8  selected sample , the 3.6  band is less sensitive to power - law objects than the 8  band , thus their fraction is even lower in the 3.6  selected sample .",
    "these objects will be rejected from the sample by criterion 1 .",
    "the ann@xmath13 method uses a subsample with known redshifts as a training set to build up an empirical relation between measurable parameters and redshifts and then applies this relation to the rest of the sample to derive their photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "almost any measurable parameter of galaxies including magnitude , surface brightness , color , size , and morphology can be used as an input node for ann@xmath13 , but magnitudes at a range of wavelengths are the most common .",
    "ann@xmath13 requires that the training set should cover the same ranges as the photometric sample in all input parameters . in other words",
    ", ann@xmath13 can not derive photometric redshift for a galaxy with input parameter values beyond the range of its training set .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift sample has a limiting magnitude of @xmath71 , but a significant number of objects in our sample are fainter than this limit . using magnitudes as input parameters to train the ann@xmath13 will allow it to derive photometric redshifts only for galaxies with @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore used colors with 3.6@xmath0 m photometry as the color base as the input nodes in the ann@xmath13 estimation .",
    "there are 11 non - redundant colors for each galaxy as shown in table  1 .",
    "faint galaxies ( @xmath72 ) at @xmath64 exhibit the same color range as the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts shown in figure  [ f : faint_cc ] , and therefore the program will be able to drive photometric redshifts for the whole sample .",
    "ann@xmath13 network architecture can be described as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of input colors for each object . for the present data , @xmath75 , the number of non - redundant colors .",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 , .... and @xmath78 are the number of nodes in each ann@xmath13 hidden layer for a total of @xmath79 layers , and @xmath80 is the number of sets for output photometric redshift , usually set to be 1 .",
    "@xcite did extensive experimenting with ann@xmath13 to determine the optimal number of hidden layers for the best photometric redshifts and found that a multi hidden layer architecture yields photometric redshifts with a lower @xmath81 than a single hidden layer architecture . a large number of layers",
    ", however , do not significantly improve photometric redshifts .",
    "@xcite adopted 6:6:6:6:1 as their fiducial architecture .",
    "we ran the ann@xmath13 with various architectures for our sample and arrived at the same conclusion .",
    "the final redshifts use 11:8:8:8:1 architecture , meaning 11 input colors , 3 hidden layers with 8 nodes in each layer , and 1 output .",
    "the accuracy of the ann@xmath13 photometric redshifts is partly determined by the number of objects in the training set .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 20000 objects to show that a larger training set can yield more accurate photometric redshifts , but increasing training set size beyond @xmath82 did not improve the accuracy significantly .",
    "there are @xmath275400 spectroscopic redshifts available in the sample .",
    "we divided the spectroscopic redshift subsample into 3 data sets : a training set , a validation set , and an independent validation set .",
    "the first two sets are required by ann@xmath13 , and the last one is used to give an independent photometric redshift validation .    any bad entries , either bad photometry or bad spectroscopic redshifts , should not be included in the training set . including these outliers",
    "will yield large scatters for the resulting photometric redshifts .",
    "we ran the ann@xmath13 estimation twice .",
    "after the first run , we compared photometric redshifts with spectroscopic redshifts in the sample and flagged those with @xmath83 . , the calculated uncertainty of the photometric redshifts , as the dispersion of @xmath84 . ] for a second training run , we updated the training and validation sets omitting flagged objects , about 3.5% of the initial sample .",
    "this iteration improved the accuracy of the photometric redshifts significantly as shown in figure  [ f : zps ] and figure  [ f : sigma ] .",
    "it is critical to assess the accuracy of photometric redshifts before using them .",
    "traditionally objects with spectroscopic redshifts are used to evaluate photometric redshift errors .",
    "ann@xmath13 requires one validation set of objects , and we created an independent subsample with spectroscopic redshifts , none of which is used for the ann@xmath13 training , for an additional validation .",
    "the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in figure  [ f : zps ] permits a direct estimation of photometric redshofts errors . the photometric redshifts derived in the first run show much more systematic deviations caused by the bad redshifts in the training set .",
    "figure  [ f : sigma ] shows a gaussian distribution of redshift errors , implying a well - defined random uncertainty characterizes most of the photometric redshifts .",
    "both the ann@xmath13 and independent validation sets yield similar @xmath85 in the second run , again with about 3.5% outliers .",
    "the training set @xmath86 can not be used for an uncertainty estimate because it was deliberately minimized by the calculation .",
    "the outlier galaxies have a median 3.6@xmath0 m flux density of 12@xmath0jy , much higher than the 6.5median flux density for the whole sample .",
    "the higher average 3.6@xmath0 m flux densities outlier galaxies may have irac fluxes contaminated by nearby objects , or two sources are unresolved by irac but resolved at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the irac 3.6@xmath0 m image has a 2angular resolution , whereas the cfht @xmath35-band images from which the deep2 + 3 sample was selected have resolution of @xmath271 .",
    "contamination or source blending are therefore expected to occur .",
    "galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts tend to be the brightest galaxies in any sample , and this is especially true in our 3.6@xmath0m - selected sample .",
    "galaxies that are faint in visible light have relatively larger photometric errors and therefore may have larger errors in their photometric redshifts .",
    "validation with the spectroscopic redshift subsample may not characterize the photometric redshift scatter for the fainter galaxies , and it is essential to assess photometric redshift accuracy for these faint objects .",
    "we propose a new method to estimate the photometric redshift standard deviation for the whole sample .",
    "the method is based on galaxy - galaxy pair statistics .",
    "a substantial fraction of galaxy visual pairs are actually physically related , and the redshift offset for a real pair should be near zero . however , the calculated photometric redshift offset for a real pair may be nonzero if either redshift is erroneous .",
    "we define a visual pair as any two galaxies within an angular separation of 30  and define the redshift offset as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are spectroscopic redshifts for two galaxies of the pair .",
    "the 30  angular distance is corresponding to a distance of 160 - 240 kpc for galaxies at z=0.4 - 1.2 , similar to the criterion of d@xmath70300kpc adopted by @xcite to study galaxy pairs and mergers in the same redshift range in the same field .",
    "@xcite found that these galaxy pairs have a very wide range of star formation activity .",
    "galaxy pairs with shorter separation ( @xmath2750kpc ) likely have higher star formation activity , otherwise they do not show any bias towards any type .",
    "figure  [ f : dz_ss ] show the histogram of @xmath90 for all visual pairs with both galaxies having redshifts in the deep2 + 3 sample .",
    "the histogram shows two components : a spike at @xmath91 for real pairs and a broad distribution for projected pairs that are physically unrelated .",
    "the expected @xmath92 for projected pairs can be easily generated using monte - carlo simulation and subtracted from the distribution for all pairs .",
    "the residual spike is the @xmath90 distribution for real pairs .",
    "as expected , both of these velocity components are small compared to the expected uncertainty in the photometric redshifts .",
    "having a large number of spectroscopic redshifts available allows pair statistics to give a good estimate of the uncertainty in the ann@xmath13 redshifts .",
    "the pair sample tested consists of galaxies separated by @xmath7030  where one galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift and the other only a photometric redshift .",
    "the normalized redshift offset is defined as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the photometric redshift and @xmath95 is the spectroscopic redshift of the respective galaxies .",
    "the histogram for all pairs ( figure  [ f : ddz_sp ] ) shows two components , as with spectroscopic pairs . subtracting the simulated distribution for unrelated pairs from the real pair distribution",
    "gives the @xmath96 distribution for physical pairs .",
    "this distribution shows a gaussian shape ( figure  [ f : ddz_sp ] ) with @xmath97 .",
    "this is very close to @xmath86 , the standard deviation of the photometric redshifts estimated from the difference between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the same galaxies .",
    "the pair method can be used directly to validate the photometric redshifts for faint galaxies with @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ f : dz_sp_faint ] shows the results .",
    "@xmath96 for these galaxies also shows a gaussian shape with @xmath97 .",
    "the pair statistics thus confirm the validity of the ann@xmath13 photometric redshifts even for galaxies fainter than the limiting magnitude of the training set .",
    "overall , @xmath86 of the photometric redshifts for the whole 3.6sample is very close to that of recent state - of - art sed - fitting photometric redshifts for optically - selected samples , which often have more than 20 bands of intermediate and broadband photometry @xcite .",
    "comparing with those photometric redshift estimations , the ann@xmath13 redshifts have well - defined and consistent error distributions for both optically bright and faint galaxies but are inherently limited to @xmath98 , the maximum redshift of the training set .",
    "with redshifts known , deriving rest frame colors and magnitudes for sample galaxies is straightforward .",
    "all types of galaxies have very similar seds at nir wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath8-band absolute magnitudes for galaxies can therefore be calculated with the 3.6  flux densities and k - correction from @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude range for the sample is @xmath99 .",
    "rest frame @xmath6 colors for the sample were derived from @xmath100 colors via a set of local galaxy sed templates ( @xcite  @xcite and @xcite took a similar approach ) .",
    "rest frame absolute @xmath7 magnitudes @xmath101 were derived in the same way .",
    "the rs and bc @xcite were divided with the @xcite criterion : @xmath102 using the same @xmath103 and @xmath7 magnitude system they used but adding 0.832 to convert from the vega to the ab system .",
    "figure  [ f : ub_b ] shows a series of color - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams for the 3.6@xmath0m - selected sample .",
    "two types of galaxies have colors placing them in the rs : dusty star - forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies with little or no star formation@xcite .",

    "it is equivalent to a stellar mass function but with a better defined completeness limit and much less model dependence .",
    "this is particularly true for our 3.6@xmath0 m selected sample . because the irac 3.6  probes roughly the rest - frame @xmath8-band for galaxies at @xmath3 , the 3.6@xmath0m - to-@xmath8 k - correction is effectively independent of galaxy color , permitting an unbiased comparison of the luminosity functions at different redshifts .",

    "both luminosity functions are plotted in figures  [ f : klf ] , and numerical values are given in table  2 .",
    "the major uncertainty in a luminosity function estimate based on a sample with small coverage or a single field is cosmic variance due to galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "our @xmath8-band luminosity functions were derived from a single 1@xmath4410  field .",
    "the maximum angular scale for this sample is 1 , and thus the cosmic variance values , @xmath142 , at @xmath1251.1 are 28%36% assuming a general correlation length @xmath143mpc @xcite .",
    "nir - selected galaxies have a correlation length similar to that of visible - selected samples : @xcite and @xcite measured correlation lengths of 4.1 and 6.4mpc for @xmath8- and irac - selected samples , respectively .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite measured two - point correlation functions for distant red galaxies ( drgs ) at @xmath23 and obtained @xmath14411mpc .",
    "the drgs have a typical stellar of @xmath145m@xmath22 .",
    "if we adopted the largest @xmath146 , the cosmic variance would be 2.5 times larger .",
    "however , this large correlation length is not applicable to the bulk of our sample but only to the most massive galaxies .",
    "the cosmic variance can also be calculated using dark matter variance and bias factor @xcite .",
    "the volumes for our sample in 4 redshift bins are @xmath271.2@xmath147mpc@xmath148 , and within these volumes the dark matter fluctuation @xmath149 .",
    "the number densities for @xmath150 galaxies in our sample are @xmath151mpc@xmath152 ( figure  [ f : klf ] ) , and therefore the bias for this population at @xmath29 is @xmath153 . according to @xcite , the cosmic variance @xmath154 , and @xmath1550.4 for the @xmath156 galaxies in our sample , consistent with values above .",

    "we show later that the vvds sample has higher mass densities for star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 than those obtained in any other survey and argue that the excess star - forming galaxies are the cause of their high @xmath8-band luminosity functions at the faint end .",
    "our @xmath8-band luminosity functions and the vvds ones with @xmath166 are higher then the local @xmath8-band luminosity function @xcite .",
    "this is not due to number evolution for massive galaxies because massive galaxies can only increase in number towards lower redshifts .",

    "<S> we present a multi - wavelength study of a 3.6@xmath0m - selected galaxy sample in the extended groth strip . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is complete for galaxies with stellar mass @xmath110@xmath2and redshift @xmath3 . in this redshift range , the irac 3.6@xmath0 m band measures the rest - frame near - infrared band , permitting nearly unbiased selection with respect to both quiescent and star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the numerous spectroscopic redshifts available in the egs are used to train an artificial neural network to estimate photometric redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of photometric redshift errors is gaussian with standard deviation @xmath4 , and the fraction of redshift failures ( @xmath5 errors ) is about 3.5% . </S>",
    "<S> a new method of validation based on pair statistics confirms the estimate of standard deviation even for galaxies lacking spectroscopic redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> basic galaxy properties measured include rest - frame @xmath6 colors , @xmath7- and @xmath8-band absolute magnitudes , and stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the sample into quiescent and star - forming galaxies according to their rest - frame @xmath6 colors and 24 to 3.6  flux density ratios and derive rest @xmath8-band luminosity functions and stellar mass functions for quiescent , star forming , and all galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that massive , quiescent galaxies were in place by @xmath9 , but lower mass galaxies generally ceased their star formation at later epochs . </S>"
