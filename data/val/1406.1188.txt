    "the g2 cloud is falling towards the sgr a * black hole ( bh hereafter ) , and was first detected in br@xmath3 images by @xcite , with an estimated mass of @xmath7 earth masses .",
    "its closest approach is estimated to occur in early 2014 @xcite , or mid - march 2014 @xcite , at a distance of @xmath8  au from the bh .",
    "@xcite show that the cloud has developed an elongated structure .",
    "part of the material might have already gone beyond periastron , as evidenced by the large velocity jump observed in pv diagrams of the extended br@xmath3 emission .",
    "this stretching of the cloud ( due to the tidal forces of the central bh ) will result in an extended cloud / bh interaction , lasting for @xmath9 yr .",
    "even though the region around the galactic center has been extensively monitored in radio wavelengths ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and in x - rays ( see @xcite ) , no emission from the g2 cloud has yet been detected .",
    "this lack of detection at radio and x - ray wavelengths provides an interesting constraint on theoretical models of the g2 cloud @xcite .",
    "two possible scenarios for the g2 cloud have been studied :    * that it is an isolated , ism cloud with an initial spherical @xcite or shell - like @xcite density distribution , * that it is a wind bubble @xcite or a photo - evaporated proto - planetary disk @xcite and therefore has a central ( undetected ) stellar nucleus .",
    "scenario @xmath10 has been studied with 2d and 3d hydrodynamic @xcite and magnetohydrodynamic @xcite simulations , showing the breakup of the cloud close to periastron and the infall of cloud material towards the central bh .    for this scenario to be acceptable",
    ", one needs a valid mechanism for the formation of the cloud , which will in principle be disrupted in its first periastron passage .",
    "for example , the possible creation of the cloud through the tidal disruption of the outer envelope of a giant star has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "scenario @xmath11 ( see above ) was modeled analytically by @xcite .",
    "these authors show that a young , low mass star with a mass loss rate @xmath12  m@xmath13  yr@xmath2 and a terminal wind velocity @xmath8  km  s@xmath2 would produce a cometary wind bubble with observational properties similar to the g2 cloud . @xcite",
    "present isothermal , axisymmetric simulations of this scenario , under the assumption of a radial orbit .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the initial approach of the cloud to the bh ( as the orbit of g2 is highly elliptical ) , but is inappropriate for modeling the periastron passage .    this `` cometary wind bubble '' scenario for the g2 cloud avoids the issue of the cloud origin .",
    "in each periastron passage , the wind bubble will be disrupted .",
    "then , at long enough timescales after the periastron passage the wind bubble will be regenerated by the continuing stellar wind pushing against the lower density , outer environment .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss 3d simulations of the time - evolution of a stellar wind bow shock , following the passage through the periastron of the g2 cloud orbit .",
    "the simulations include a model for the coronal environment around the bh @xcite , the gravity force of the bh , and a parametrized cooling function .",
    "the differences between our simulations and the ones of @xcite is that our simulations are 3d ( instead of axisymmetric ) and include a cooling function ( instead of using an isothermal approximation ) .",

    "we also take into account the effect of uv photons emitted by the massive stars present in the bh environment , by adding a heating term , which has the only effect of keeping the gas temperature above 10@xmath20  k. we assume that the h in the wind is fully ionized .",
    "the exact stratification of the bh environment is uncertain . in this paper , we take a density and pressure radial dependence of the form @xmath21  g@xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , being @xmath24 the distance from the bh .",
    "this stratified medium is convectively unstable . to avoid the development of the instability , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reset at every timestep the value of the bh environment density to the unperturbed , hydrostatic value",
    "this is the same strategy used in one of our simulations ( integrated for 20 yrs , see below ) .",
    "we also run two simulations integrated during 4 yrs and without resetting the bh environment , i.e. properly computing the bow shock dynamics .",
    "we assume that the g2 cloud is originated by the stellar wind ( with a mass - loss rate @xmath25  m@xmath1yr@xmath2 ) ejected by a young star , which is moving in a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath26 ) with a period of 198  yr @xcite around the super - massive bh .",
    "the interaction of the wind with the ambient medium produces a double shock structure , with an internal shock where the free - wind gas is decelerated , and an external shock where the ambient medium is accelerated .",
    "the distance from the double shock structure to the center of the star can be estimated from the ram pressure balance between the wind and the ambient medium ( in the reference system of the star ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the terminal velocity of the stellar wind , @xmath29 is the ( position dependent ) environmental density and @xmath30 is the orbital velocity of the stellar source of the g2 cloud .",
    "the stellar wind is imposed in the code by rewriting at every timestep the values of the density and velocity inside a sphere with radius @xmath31 ( centered on the star ) with the free - wind values .    to study the effect of changing the wind velocity and of injecting the wind during different periods , we run three models : a high velocity model with a @xmath32  kms@xmath2  wind velocity integrated for 4 yrs , starting 3 yrs before periastron , and two low velocity models with @xmath14  kms@xmath2 , and durations of 4 ( starting 3 yrs before periastron ) and 20 yrs ( starting 19 yrs before periastron ) .",
    "the density of the wind is calculated as @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the distance from the star ) .",
    "the pressure is chosen by fixing the temperature of the wind at 10@xmath20  k , and using the ideal gas equation of state .",
    "the exact value of the wind temperature is not important as the mach number is @xmath35 in the free - wind region .",
    "the simulations employ 3d cartesian coordinates , with a volume of physical size extending from ( -8.2@xmath3610@xmath37,-3@xmath3610@xmath37,0 )  cm to ( 10@xmath37,1.5@xmath3610@xmath37,10@xmath37 )  cm in the simulation lasting 20 yrs , and from ( -2.2@xmath3610@xmath37,-2@xmath3610@xmath37,0 )  cm to ( 8@xmath3610@xmath38,1.5@xmath3610@xmath37,5@xmath3610@xmath38 )  cm in the simulations lasting 4 yrs along the @xmath39- , @xmath40- and @xmath41-axes , respectively , sampled by using ( 184,90,20 ) and ( 96,112,16 ) cells at the coarsest level of refinement respectively .",
    "reflective boundary conditions are used on the @xmath42 ( orbital ) plane .",
    "the maximum number of levels of refinement is chosen by requiring a minimum of 20 cells in @xmath43 ( and is therefore changing with time ) .",
    "as the star approaches periastron , @xmath43 ( equation [ eq : rsh ] ) becomes increasingly small and a maximum of 8 levels of refinement are necessary to properly resolve the free - wind region in the simulations lasting 4 yrs , corresponding to a maximum resolution of 2.4@xmath44  cm . to limit the computational time , in the simulation lasting 20 yrs @xmath43",

    "the br@xmath3 luminosity is computed by integrating the flux emitted by the shocked wind and by adding a fixed luminosity of @xmath46 erg s@xmath2 ( bottom curves ) and @xmath47 erg s@xmath2 ( upper curves ) to simulate the emission coming from the ( unresolved in the simulaton ) inner region of the unshocked wind . ]",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show density slices on the orbital plane for integration times @xmath48  yr ( i.e. , 1/3 years before periastron ) , 0.2 yr and 1 yr ( after periastron ) for the @xmath5 and 200  km  s@xmath2 simulations :    * in the @xmath49  yr frames we see that the @xmath50  km  s@xmath2 model has a cometary wind bubble @xmath51 times the size of the one of the @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 simulation ( as expected from equation [ eq : rsh ] ) , * in the @xmath52  yr time frames ( central column of figure [ fig3 ] ) , the two simulations show that the wind bubble has become a broken filament , with a long , trailing tail and a shorter region extending ahead of the position of the stellar wind source , * in the @xmath53  yr frames , the region around the bh is filled with a complex distribution of accreting , clumpy structures .",
    "the stellar wind is beginning to reform a cometary bubble ( seen in the top region of the @xmath5 and 200 km s@xmath2 simulations ) . also , we see filamentary density structures connecting the regenerated wind bubbles to the region close to the bh , * figure [ fig2 ] shows the effect obtained by considering a wind injected during a much longer timescale .",
    "wind material accumulates around the central star , while a low density , extended tail forms behind the cometary wind bubble which is also more extended in volume before periastron .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a composition of the predicted br@xmath3 intensity maps for different evolutionary times and a position - velocity diagram for the 20 yrs , @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 simulation .",
    "the br@xmath3 emission coefficient is obtained by solving a 15 energy level recombination cascade problem with the parameters of @xcite . from a fit to the temperature dependence of the br@xmath3 emission we obtain : @xmath54 which reproduces the recombination cascade calculation within 3%  in the @xmath55  k temperature range .",
    "these intensity maps correspond to the orientation of the g2 cloud orbit given by @xcite .",
    "these maps show the evolution of the cloud from a cometary shape ( for times @xmath56  yr ) to an elongated filament ( at @xmath57 ) and finally to a more compact , centrally peaked emission structure ( in the months following periastron passage ) .",
    "a relatively long time , of order @xmath58cm/@xmath28 ( @xmath59  yr for the @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 model ) will be necessary for the cloud to regain the size that it had at @xmath49  yr before periastron .",
    "the @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 model presents less extended emission at all evolutionary times .",
    "the position - velocity diagram ( figure [ fig3 ] ) shows an elongated emission extending a few hundred km s@xmath2 in the velocity channel , qualitatively similar to the observed one ( e.g. @xcite ) , becoming less extended spatially after periastron passage and much more extended in velocity space during and immediately after periastron passage .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the spatially integrated br@xmath3 luminosity as a function of time , computed by adding the contribution of the cells located at a distance @xmath60 from the center of the star , i.e. , the shocked wind , and a fixed contribution of 10@xmath61 - 10@xmath62  erg  s@xmath2 assumed to come from the inner - region of the free - wind , and corresponding to a recombination rate of 10@xmath63 - 10@xmath64  s@xmath2 respectively .",
    "the shocked wind component of the @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 model shows a larger br@xmath3 luminosity ( by a factor @xmath65 ) with respect to the the @xmath50  km  s@xmath2 model .",
    "both models present a slow rise during the months / years preceding periastron passage , which is not present when the constant free - wind flux dominates the total luminosity , and a fast decrease during the first month after periastron .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig5 ] we show the mass accretion rate @xmath66 for the 20 yrs , @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 model , computed by tracking the mass density flux across a @xmath67  cm sphere centered on the bh .",
    "@xmath66 shows a quick increase during periastron passage , followed by a slow drop of the mass accretion rate after @xmath68  yr , with values of @xmath66 of @xmath69  m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 .",
    "we can therefore expect that the mass accretion rate will remain large ( above @xmath70  m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 ) for several years after periastron passage .",
    "our 3d simulations of the interaction between a stellar wind and the sgr a * environment show a complex dynamical behavior . as the star moves towards periastron , a weak forward shock ( with mach number @xmath71 )",
    "is formed . because of the rapid increase in the orbital velocity , the shocked region is unable to adjust to the equilibrium configuration expected from ram - pressure balance ( equation [ eq : rsh ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the size of the interaction region is larger ( smaller ) than predicted by equation [ eq : rsh ] before ( after ) periastron passage . at periastron , strong tidal forces and the development of instabilities",
    "break the wind bubble , forming an elongated structure with small , dense condensations .",
    "these dense knots accrete onto the central region with a @xmath72 of @xmath73  m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 accretion rate ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "these values are comparable to those obtained in 3d simulations of the isolated clump scenario @xcite , and are also of the same order as the accretion rate on the bh inferred from the x - ray sgr a * luminosity ( @xmath74 - 10@xmath75  m@xmath76 yr@xmath2 , see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spherical mass accretion rate @xcite , computed at the distance from the bh where our value of @xmath77 is calculated ( r = 10@xmath38  cm ) , is @xmath78  m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) . as the streams of material accreting from g2 onto the inner region of the bh ( where the x - ray emission is thought to be generated ) depends on",
    "not fully understood physical processes ( see , e.g. , the discussion of @xcite ) , it is possible that the small @xmath72 obtained from the simulations ( @xmath79 ) could produce x - ray flares during the upcoming years .",
    "no variations in the emission at radio wavelengths ( associated with relativistic electrons accelerated by the g2 forward shock ) have yet been detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the scenario of g2 as an isolated ism cloud , @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) predicted detectable radio emission with a flux @xmath80 ten times the sgr a * quiescent flux , while , more recently , @xcite obtained a 30 times lower radio flux ( for the same scenario ) by assuming a lower size for the radio emitting region .    in the context of a stellar wind model ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the radio emission decreases with the forward shock size as the star approaches periastron .",
    "our simulations confirm that the forward shock size drops quickly when the star approaches periastron indicating that it is unlikely to produce detectable radio emission .",
    "however , a detailed calculation based on the results of numerical simulations is necessary to make a quantitative prediction of the radio emission , as a simple analytical approach fails to describe the elongated , broken shock structure observed during the periastron passage .",
    "observations of the g2 cloud with the _ integral field spectrograph _ on the vlt , sinfoni , show a compact br@xmath3 emission from the head of g2 with a luminosity of @xmath4  erg s@xmath2 , and an extended tail with approximately the same luminosity @xcite . our low - velocity ( @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 )",
    "simulation does produce a compact emission and an extended tail with comparable br@xmath3 luminosities ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the br@xmath3 luminosity of the g2 cloud has remained nearly constant ( within the statistical errors ) during the last @xmath81   yrs @xcite , while in both the stellar wind and the isolated clump one would expect an increase in the flux as ionization of neutral gas should become more efficient approaching periastron @xcite . in our simulations , both the gas in the free - wind region and the shocked stellar wind material contribute to the br@xmath3 emission .",
    "the emission from the shocked ambient medium gas is negligible as it is too hot and rarefied to emit efficiently at infrared wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows that the emission from the shocked stellar wind increases approaching periastron ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the observation remains therefore puzzling .",
    "to explain it , we assume the presence of a strong ambient photoionizing radiative field ( resulting in a strong br@xmath3 emission from the free wind region ) , larger than the variability obtained from the simulations in the total br@xmath3 luminosity .",
    "a solution to this problem , requiring detailed modeling of the bh environment including radiation transfer , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our simulations illustrate the fact that ( in the stellar wind bow shock scenario ) once the g2 cloud passes through periastron and the tail of dense , ionized gas moves toward the central bh , the br@xmath3 emission becomes less extended and more peaked on the position of the star ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a caveat in the interpretation of our 3d simulations is that they do not properly resolve the dense , low filling factor gas seen in the axisymmetric simulations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might expect that higher br@xmath3 luminosities might be obtained in simulations with higher resolutions .",
    "this can be seen e.g. comparing the br@xmath3 emission of the low velocity models in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "recent observations by ghez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) show that g2 is still intact at periastron passage , indicating that a stellar component is probably present within the g2 cloud . clearly , the issue of whether or not the g2 cloud is fed by a central , stellar source will be elucidated by observations over the next few months . if there is indeed a stellar component to g2",
    ", a compact br@xmath3 source should survive periastron passage and continue its motion along the g2 orbit .",
    "this compact source should become more extended over the next few years , as the stellar wind bow shock develops again .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper are a first attempt at modelling the destruction of a stellar wind bubble on passage through the g2 periastron . in about a @xmath9 yr timescale ,",
    "once observations of the periastron passage clarify the origin of the g2 cloud , it might become worthwhile to pursue more detailed models , e.g. , including the rotation of the bh environment @xcite and/or the transfer of ionizing radiation .",
