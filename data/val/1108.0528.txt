    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) constitutes a fundamental platform for studying the quantum dynamics of matter systems interacting with electromagnetic fields  @xcite . for a single two - level quantum system interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field of a resonator",
    ", a particularly interesting regime of cqed is reached when the rate , @xmath0 , at which single excitations are coherently exchanged between the two - level system and the cavity field mode exceeds both the decay rate of the two - level system , @xmath1 , and the rate , @xmath2 , at which the cavity field decays  @xcite .",
    "this so - called strong coupling regime was investigated first with single atoms in microwave and optical cavities  @xcite and recently with quantum dots  @xcite and superconducting josephson junctions  @xcite . in the optical domain",
    ", the use of ultrahigh - finesse cavities with a very small modevolume allows for reaching the confinement of the light field required to achieve strong coupling with single neutral atoms  @xcite . with charged particles",
    ", however , the insertion of dielectric mirrors in the trapping region makes it extremely challenging to obtain sufficiently small cavity modevolumes , due to the associated perturbation of the trapping potentials and charging effects  @xcite .",
    "although the strong coupling regime has not yet been reached with ions , single ions in optical cavities have been successfully used for , e.g. , probing the spatial structure of cavity fields  @xcite , enhanced spectroscopy  @xcite , the generation of single photons  @xcite , the investigation of cavity sideband cooling  @xcite , or the demonstration of a single ion laser  @xcite .    for an ensemble of @xmath3 identical two - level systems simultaneously interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field ,",
    "the coherent coupling rate is enhanced by a factor @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this leads to another interesting regime of cqed , the so - called _ collective _ strong coupling regime  @xcite , where the _ collective _ coupling rate @xmath5 is larger than both @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this regime , first explored with rydberg atoms in microwave cavities  @xcite , has been realized in the optical domain with atomic beams  @xcite , atoms in magneto - optical traps  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and , recently , with ion coulomb crystals  @xcite .",
    "this cavity - enhanced collective interaction with an ensemble has many applications within quantum optics and quantum information processing  @xcite , including the establishment of strong nonlinearities  @xcite , qnd measurements  @xcite , the production  @xcite and storage  @xcite of single - photons , the generation of squeezed and entangled states of light  @xcite and atoms @xcite , the observation of cavity optomechanical effects  @xcite , cavity cooling  @xcite , and the investigation of quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "this paper provides a detailed description and a theoretical analysis of experiments achieving _ collective _ strong coupling with ions  @xcite .",

    "@xcite as well as of complementary new measurements . generally , a very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results is obtained . as also emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the realization of collective strong coupling with ion crystals is important for ion - based cqed  @xcite and enables , e.g. , for the realization of quantum information processing devices , such as high - efficiency , long - lived quantum memories  @xcite and repeaters  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the well - established attractive properties of cold , trapped ions for quantum information processing  @xcite , ion coulomb crystals benefit from unique properties which can be exploited for cqed purposes . first , their uniform density under linear quadrupole trapping conditions  @xcite makes it possible to couple the same ensemble equally to different transverse cavity modes  @xcite and opens for the realization of multimode quantum light - matter interfaces  @xcite , where the spatial degrees of freedom of light can be exploited in addition to the traditional polarization and frequency encodings  @xcite .",
    "second , their cold , solid - like nature combined with their strong optical response to radiation pressure forces and their tunable mode spectrum  @xcite make ion coulomb crystals a unique medium to investigate cavity optomechanical effects  @xcite .",
    "ion coulomb crystals could , for instance , be used as a model system to study the back action of the cavity light field on the collective motion of mesoscopic objects at the quantum limit , as was recently demonstrated with ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
