    "the basic goal of the ckm experiment  @xcite experiment  @xcite is to determine @xmath3 , contributing to test the standard model hypothesis that a single phase in the ckm matrix is the sole source of @xmath4 violation .",
    "the idea is to over - constrain the predictions with measurements . to really falsify the hypothesis",
    ", one needs a set of observables which can not only be measured sufficiently well , but also need to have controlled errors in the theoretical connection between the observable and the ckm matrix elements .",
    "a short list of these clean measurements to be made in the near future includes : @xmath5 ( the golden mode at the @xmath6-factories ) , the ratio of the mixing parameters of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( to be measured at the tevatron ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the standard model prediction for the branching ratio of @xmath9 is  @xcite @xmath11 $ ] , defining an ellipse in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "the calculation  @xcite is done as a ratio to the branching ration of the decay @xmath13 , via weak isospin rotation . with current values",
    "this leads to @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is estimated to be around @xmath15  @xcite , and dominated by the uncertainty in the charm quark mass .",
    "we therefore aim at observing 100  events of that decay , giving a measurement of @xmath3 of @xmath1 including theoretical errors .",
    "recently the brookhaven experiment  787 observed  @xcite two events of this decay after several years of running ; their branching ratio measurement is high but consistent with the prediction of the standard model .",
    "a continuation of that stopped kaon experiment , e949 , hopes to see 5 - 10  events in the next couple of years .",
    "the ckm ( charged kaons at the main injector ) collaboration the ckm ( charged kaons at the main injector )  @xcite collaboration plans to measure the branching ratio of @xmath9 to a statistical precision of @xmath1 by observing the decay _ in flight_. after a lengthy process  @xcite the experiment obtained stage  1 ( physics ) approval at fermilab in june  2001 .",
    "the experiment plans to run in parallel to the collider run  2 .",
    "protons from the fermilab main injector are used to produce an rf - separated beam , containing @xmath16 @xmath2 per second , with a total flux of @xmath17 .",
    "a layout of the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ layout ] .",
    "the largest part of the experiment is a @xmath18 long vacuum decay volume , filled with photon counters to veto against ( under others ) the decay @xmath19 , one of the main backgrounds to suppress .",
    "this system should give a @xmath20 rejection of @xmath21 , requiring an additional kinematic rejection of @xmath22 by redundant spectrometer systems : two conventional magnetic spectrometers and two velocity spectrometers based on rich detectors .",
    "the kinematic rejection uses the fact that the main background modes are two - body decays , and , if calculating the invariant mass the @xmath23 recoils to ( @xmath24 ) , results within resolution a fixed value , whereas the signal mode is a three - body decay , leading to a distribution in @xmath24 .",
    "the spectrometer systems have to measure the magnitude of the momenta of the @xmath2 and @xmath23 , as well as the decay angle between the @xmath2 and @xmath23 .",
    "the velocity spectrometers consist of rich detectors , which will measure the vector velocity ( magnitude via the ring radius , track angles via the position of the ring center ) for the incoming @xmath2 and for the outgoing @xmath23 .",
    "the detectors are modeled after the selex rich  @xcite , following the founding principle of the experiment that only proven detector technologies should be used to avoid surprises while searching for very rare decays .",
    "the results from the selex rich are being used to study resolution effects and to tune the monte carlo simulation .    =    in fig .  [ radmom ]",
    "we show , when operating the rich close to threshold , that one can obtain with a modest accuracy in ring radius an excellent measurement of momentum .",
    "in addition , the curves for kaon and pion are widely separated , so particle identification comes nearly for free . that a rich can be operated in this regime",
    "was shown by the selex rich  @xcite .    the experiment requires momentum and angular resolutions in the order of @xmath25 , which can easily be translated into required ring radius resolutions .",
    "an even more important question is how gaussian is this resolution , e.g.  how will non - gaussian tails in the resolution function affect the overall performance when searching for rare decays .",
    "=    in fig .",
    "[ 06kpmg ] we show the result of a study with selex data , single track events with @xmath26 . to assign hits to a ring",
    ", we used the standard selex algorithm , which uses the information of the tracking system to determine the ring center .",
    "the average number of hits on a ring is @xmath27 , with a poisson distribution .",
    "we fit a sum of gaussians to this distribution , where the width of the gaussians is scaled by @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the number of hits on a ring ) , and the weight is given by how many events we observed for every given @xmath29 . as can be seen , the resolution function shows a gaussian behavior over more than 4 orders of magnitude .    for ckm we do not want to use information from the tracking system in order to keep the two spectrometer systems really independent and redundant .",
    "we used the same selex sample as above , but this time performing a ring fit assigning _ all _ observed hits to the ring .",
    "we calculated the pull ( deviation from mean divided by error ) for the radius , where we scaled again the error with @xmath28 . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig63 ] .",
    "=    the gaussian behavior found in this study is already sufficient for the experiment .",
    "we are currently working on improving the pattern recognition algorithm .",
    "in addition , the integration in selex was @xmath30 , and in ckm we expect a time resolution in the order of a few  nsec , which should help to reduce the noise contribution .",
    "the pion rich will be a straight copy of the selex rich , with the only exception of doubling the vessel length from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , with a corresponding change in curvature of the mirrors to @xmath33 .",
    "the radiator gas will be neon at atmospheric pressure .",
    "monte carlo simulations showed that we should use @xmath34photomultipliers sensitive down to @xmath35 to obtain a momentum resolution in the @xmath25 range .",
    "the resolution is balanced between the different contributions ( pm size , chromatic dispersion ) , and the @xmath36-@xmath37 separation is @xmath38 .",
    "due to the beam characteristics ( about @xmath39 diameter , very small divergence ) only a small number of phototubes is needed to cover the focal plane of the kaon rich .",
    "due to space restrictions and rate problems , we will double - fold the light path in a @xmath40 long vessel , filled either with n@xmath41 at atmospheric pressure or with cf@xmath42 at about @xmath43 . the spherical mirror ( @xmath33 radius ) and",
    "the second flat mirror will be outside the beam .",
    "the mirror sizes are chosen so that only part of the cherenkov photons for the ( bigger ) pion ring are reflected , but the number of detected photons is still enough , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kaonrich ] .",
    "the rings from kaons and pions are nicely separated , a fact we will use in the experiment trigger . the rates per tube will be as high as @xmath44 . the resolution is limited by chromatic dispersion , and we will use @xmath34photomultipliers with a cutoff around @xmath45 .",
    "we implemented both riches , together with all other detectors , into geant  @xcite .",
    "we ran studies with up to @xmath46 @xmath19 events with full kinematic reconstruction to verify the performance of single detectors and of the experiment as a whole .",
    "detailed results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a main result is that we have no correlations between the two spectrometer systems ( magnetic , riches ) . with the current design we should be able to reach the goal of the experiment .",
    "the recently approved ckm experiment will measure the branching ratio of @xmath9 with 100  events , to obtain a @xmath47 measurement , including theoretical uncertainties , of the magnitude of @xmath48 .",
    "we will employ two phototube rich detectors , modeled after the selex rich , as velocity spectrometers .",
    "we can stand high rates , have a very low noise rate , good time resolution ( all intrinsic properties of photomultipliers ) , and we expect the non - gaussian tails of the resolution functions to be sufficiently small .",
