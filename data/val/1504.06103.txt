    "in the last thirty years , a large number of diverse visual tracking methods has been proposed  @xcite .",

    "three observations motivate the presented research .",
    "first , most trackers perform poorly if run outside the scenario they were designed for .",
    "second , some trackers make different and complementary assumptions and their failures are not highly correlated ( called complementary trackers in the paper ) . and",
    "finally , even fairly complex well performing trackers run at frame rate or faster on standard hardware , opening the possibility for multiple trackers to run concurrently and yet in or near real - time .",
    "we propose a novel methodology that exploits a hidden markov model ( hmm ) for fusion of non - uniform observables and pose prediction of multiple complementary trackers using an on - line learned high - precision detector .",
    "the non - uniform observables , in this sense , means that each tracker can produce its own type of  confidence estimate  which may not be directly comparable between each other .    the hmm , trained in an unsupervised manner , estimates the state of the trackers  failed , operates correctly  and outputs the pose of the tracked object taking into account the past performance and observations of the trackers and the detector .",
    "the hmm treats the detector output as correct if it is not in contradiction with its current most probable state in which the majority of trackers are correct .",
    "this limits the cases where the hmm would be wrongly updated by a false detection . for the potentially many frames where reliable detector output is not available",
    ", it combines the trackers .",
    "the detector is trained on the first image and interacts with the learning of the hmm by partially annotating the sequence of hmm states in the time of verified detections .",

    "the appearance modeling is performed inside of each tracker and the hmmtxd capture the relation of the confidence provided by tracker and its performance , validated by the object detector , by the observable distributions . moreover , the hmmtxd confidence estimation is motion - model free and this prevents biases towards support of trackers with a particular motion model .",

    "the contributions of the paper are : a novel method for fusion of multiple trackers based on hmms using non - uniform observables , a simple , and so far unused , unsupervised method for hmms training in the context of tracking , tunable feature - based detector with very low false positive rate , and the creation of a tracking system that shows state - of - the - art performance .",
    "hmmtxd uses a hidden markov model ( hmm ) to integrate pose and observational confidence of different trackers and a detector , and updates its own confidence estimates that in turn define the pose that it outputs . in the hmm , each tracker is modeled as working correctly ( 1 ) or incorrectly ( 0 ) .",
    "the hmm poses no constraints on the definition of tracker correctness , we adopted target overlap above a threshold .",
    "having at our disposal @xmath1 trackers , the set of all possible states is @xmath2 and the initial state @xmath3 .",
    "note that the trackers are not assumed to be independent , because an independence of tracker correctness is not a realistic assumption .",

    "the number of states @xmath4 grows exponentially with the number of trackers .",
    "however , we do not consider this a significant issue  due to  real - time  requirements of tracking , the need to combine more than a small number of trackers , say @xmath5 , is unlikely .",

    "each tracker provides an estimate of the object pose ( @xmath6 ) and a vector of observables ( @xmath7 ) , which may contain a similarity measure to some model ( such as normalized cross - correlation to the initial image patch , distance of template and current histograms at given position , etc . ) or any other estimates of the tracker performance .",
    "the @xmath8 serve as observables to relate the tracker current confidence to the hmm .",
    "each individual observable depends only on one particular tracker and its correctness , hence , they are assumed to be conditionally independent conditioned on the state of the hmm ( which encodes the tracker correctness ) .     and the detector outputs either the verified object pose @xmath9 or nothing .",
    "if detector fires , hmm is updated and trackers are reinitialized and the final output is the @xmath9 , otherwise , hmm estimate the most probable state @xmath10 and outputs an average bounding box @xmath11 of trackers that are correct in the estimated state @xmath10.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    in general , there are no constraints on observable values , however , in the proposed hmm the observable values are required to be normalized to the @xmath12 interval .",
    "the observables are modeled as beta - distributed random variables ( eq .",
    "[ eq : beta ] ) and its parameters are estimated online .",
    "the beta distribution was chosen for its versatility , where practically any kind of unimodal random variable on @xmath12 can be modeled by the beta distribution , i.e. for any choice of any lower and upper quantiles , a beta distribution exists satisfying the given quantile constraint  @xcite .",
    "learning the parameters of the beta distributions online is crucial for the adaptability to particular tracking scenes , where the observable values from a different trackers may be biased due to scene properties , or to adapt to a different types of observables of trackers and their correlations to the  real  tracker performance .",
    "for example , taking correlation with the initial target patch as an observable for one tracker and color histogram distance to a initial target for a second tracker , the correlation between their values and the performance of the tracker may differ depending on object rigidity and color distribution of object and background",

    "the requirements for the detector are : adjustable operation mode ( e.g. set for high precision but possibly low recall ) , ( near ) real - time performance and the ability to model pose transformations up to at least similarity ( translation , rotation , isotropic scaling ) .",
    "basically , any detector - like approach can be used and it may vary based on application .",
    "we choose to adapt a feature - based detector which has been shown to perform well in image retrieval , object detection and object tracking  @xcite tasks .",
    "there are many possible combinations of features and their descriptors with different advantages and drawbacks .",
    "we exploit multiple feature types : specifically , hessian keypoints with the sift  @xcite descriptor , orb  @xcite with brisk and orb with freak  @xcite .",
    "each feature type is handled separately , up to the point where point correspondences are established .",
    "a weight is assigned to each feature type @xmath83 and is set to be inversely proportional to the number of features on the reference template , to balance the disparity in individual feature numbers .",
    "the detector works as follows . in the initialization step ,",
    "features are extracted from the inside and the outside of the region specifying the tracked object .",
    "descriptors of the features outside of the region are stored as the background model .",
    "usually , the input region is not @xmath0 occupied by the target ; therefore , fast color segmentation  @xcite attempts to delineate the object more precisely than the axis - aligned bounding box to remove the features that are most likely not on the target .",
    "the step is not critical for the function of the detector , since the bounding box is a fall - back option .",
    "we assume that at least @xmath84 of the bounding box is filled with pixels that belong to the target , if the segmentation fails ( returns a region containing less than @xmath84 of area of the bounding box ) , all features in the initial bounding box are used .",
    "additionally , for each target feature , we use a normal distribution @xmath85 to model the similarity of the feature to other features .",
    "the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 are estimated in the first frame by randomly sampling 100 features , other than @xmath88 , and computing distances to the feature @xmath88 , from which the mean and variation are computed .",
    "this allows defining the quality of correspondence matches in a probabilistic manner for each feature , thus getting rid of global static threshold for the acceptable correspondence distance .    in the detection phase",
    ", features are detected and described in the whole image . for each feature @xmath89 from the image the nearest neighbour ( in euclidean space or in hamming distance metric space , depending on the feature type ) feature @xmath90 from the background model and the nearest neighbour feature @xmath91 from the foreground model are computed .",
    "a tentative correspondence is formed if the feature match passes the second nearest neighbour test and a probability that the correspondence distance belongs to the outlier distribution is lower than a predefined significance set to @xmath92 .",

    "the decision whether the detected pose is considered correct depends on the number of weighted inliers that supports the ransac - selected transformation and it controls the trade - of between precision and recall of the method .",
    "this threshold is automatically computed in the first frame of the sequence as @xmath99 . the threshold interval ( 5,10 ) and the feature multiplier ( 0.03 )",
    "were set experimentally to have the false positive rate close to zero for the most of the testing sequences .",
    "furthermore , majority voting is used to verify that the detection is not in contradiction to the estimated hmm state , i.e. if we are in the state where two or more ( majority ) trackers are correct and the detector is not consistent with them , the detection is not used .",
    "this mitigates the false positive detections , therefore hmm updates , when the trackers works correctly .",
    "the true and false positives for 77 sequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : det_perf ] , where the detector works on almost all sequences with zero false positive rate ( @xmath100 average false positive rate on the dataset ) and @xmath101 recall rate .",
    "the failure cases of this feature - based detector are mostly caused by the imprecise initial bounding box , which contains large portion of structured background ( i.e. background where the detector finds features ) and due to the presence of similar object in the scene , e.g. sequences _",
    "hand2 , basketball , singer2_.",
    "to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework , a pair and a triplet of published short - term trackers were plugged into the framework to show the performance gain by combination of a different number of trackers .",
    "as bailer et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out , not all trackers when combined can improve the overall performance ( i.e. adding tracking method with similar failure mode will not benefit ) .",
    "we therefore choose methods that have a different designs and work with different assumptions ( e.g. rigid global motion vs. color mean - shift estimation vs. maximum correlation response ) .",
    "these trackers are the flock of trackers ( fot )  @xcite , scale adaptive mean - shift tracker ( asms )  @xcite and kernelized correlation filters ( kcf )  @xcite .",
    "this choice shows that superior performance can be achieved by using simple , fast trackers ( above 100fps ) that may not represent the state - of - the - art .",

    "the results for the baseline and region - noise experiments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vot2013bench ] .",
    "note that the ranking of the methods differs from the original publication since two new methods ( hmmtxd and meem ) were added and the relative ranking of the methods changed .",
    "the top three performing trackers and their average ranks are hmmtxd ( @xmath113 ) , plt ( @xmath114 ) , lgtpp  @xcite ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "meem tracker ends up at the fifth place with average rank @xmath116 .",
    "the rankings were obtained by the toolkit provided by the vot in default settings for baseline and region noise experiments .",
    "the second best performing method on the vot2013 is the unpublished plt for which just a short description is available in @xcite .",
    "plt is a variation of structural svm that uses multiple features ( color , gradients )",
    ". struck  @xcite and meem  @xcite are similar method to the plt based on svm classification .",
    "we compared these method with hmmtxd on the diverse 77 videos along with the tld  @xcite which has a similar design as hmmtxd .",
    "hmmtxd outperforms all these methods by a large margin on average recall  measured as number of frames where the tracker overlap with ground truth is higher than @xmath102 averaged over all sequences .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tv77bench ] .",
    "qualitative comparison of these state - of - the - art methods is shown in fig .",

    "even for sequences with lower recall ( e.g. _ bird_1 , skating2 _ ) , the hmmtxd is able to follow the object of interest .",
    "a novel method called hmmtxd for fusion of multiple trackers has been proposed .",
    "the method utilizes an on - line trained hmm to estimate the states of the individual trackers and to fuse a different types of observables provided by the trackers .",
    "the hmmtxd outperforms its constituent parts ( fot , asms , kcf , detector and its combinations ) by a large margin and shows the efficiency of the hmm with combination of three trackers .",
    "hmmtxd outperforms all methods included in the cvpr2013 benchmark and perform favorably against most recent state - of - the - art tracker .",
    "the hmmtxd also outperforms all method of the vot2013 benchmark in accuracy , while maintaining very good robustness , and ranking in the first place in overall ranking .",
    "experiments conducted on a diverse dataset tv77 show that the hmmtxd outperforms state - of - the - art meem , struck and tld methods , which are similar in design , by a large margin .",
    "the processing speed of the hmmtxd is @xmath117 frames per second on average , which is comparable with other complex tracking methods .",
