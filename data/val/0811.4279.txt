    "five growth sectors are formed , propagating from the facets of the crystal through the entire material  @xcite .",
    "the critical currents achieved in each growth sector , especially as a function of the seed distance , are therefore of particular interest .",
    "a straightforward approach is to cut the sample and to characterise small pieces by magnetometry .",

    "the magnetoscan technique  @xcite proved to provide detailed information on the critical current flow on a local scale . however , even the strongest permanent magnets used in the magnetoscan device activate currents only in the uppermost layer of the bulk .",
    "the information refers to depths of less than  @xcite and the inside of the bulk can not be probed .",
    "currents flowing in the entire volume of the bulk can be activated by performing a ( zero ) field cooled hysteresis loop in a magnet . in principle sufficient data to calculate the current density on the sub - mm length scale , where substantial changes in @xmath3 are expected , can be obtained from trapped field maps .",
    "although elaborate and numerically stable techniques exist  @xcite , it was shown @xcite that due to the large thickness of those samples the matrix inverted in such procedures is notoriously ill conditioned and can even be numerically singular . thus , a reduction in thickness , either by grinding or preferably by cutting the bulk into disks , is mandatory to assess the local critical current distribution in this way .",
    "if the disk is sufficiently thin , a scanning mesh can be found which allows both an analysis of the current density on the sub - mm scale and a comparison to the magnetoscan signal at certain positions .",

    "discretisation of the integral equation using cubic volume elements with constant @xmath10 results in the 2d matrix equation    @xmath11    here @xmath12  denotes the sample thickness , @xmath13  the distance between the active area of the hall probe and the top sample surface ( gap ) , @xmath14  the step width , and , the indices on the mesh ; the antiderivative @xmath15 is evaluated at the eight corners of the cubes in  ( [ eqn : oneb ] ) .",
    "equation  [ eqn : onea ] can be mapped one - to - one to 1d by substituting @xmath16 .",
    "the equation now reads    @xmath17    and the problem can be tackled by matrix inversion algorithms .    as pointed out earlier ,",
    "the matrix @xmath18 is in fact a toeplitz block toeplitz matrix  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the translation invariance of the biot - savart law ( @xmath19 ) and results in a highly symmetric matrix @xmath20 ( cf .",

    "therefore , both efficient storage and a fast algorithm for solving the system can be expected . however , @xcite  exploits the symmetry only for the storage of the matrix elements and the method of conjugated gradients using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) is employed to solve the linear equation .",
    "although the procedure is fast , employing fft @xcite implies the unnecessary assumption of periodicity in @xmath21 outside the measurement area , which may create artefacts , if currents are flowing close to the edge of the scanning area .",

    "fortunately , an efficient and fast algorithm , which exploits the symmetry of the structured matrix , is provided in  @xcite .",
    "the computation time is approximately 10  minutes for a @xmath22 system on a desktop pc .",
    "this is presumably longer than fft based algorithms , but still much less than the actual measurement time .",
    "the residuum of the solution is of the order of the machine error .",
    "however , it is shown in standard numerical algebra textbooks , that matrix inversions can amplify a relative ( measurement ) error @xmath23 in the right - hand side of  ( [ eqn : two ] ) , leading to an unknown error in the calculated magnetisation density @xmath24 .",
    "this behaviour is described by the condition number @xmath25 of a linear system    @xmath26    where the errors are measured in euclidean norm .",

    "the current density involves computing a ( numerical ) derivative , which implies that the relative error in @xmath9 will be high , if the change in @xmath31 ( the current at this position ) vanishes , as for example outside of the bulk or in defects .",
    "this is a peculiarity of measuring the relative error of a quantity close to zero .",
    "note that the absolute error in @xmath9 is bounded by  ( [ eqn : three ] ) and expected to be acceptably low for most of the current distribution inside the sample as long as  ( [ eqn : four ] ) holds .",
    "a thin disk was cut from an undoped ybco bulk superconductor with a diameter of , which was grown by the top seeded melt growth technique @xcite , using a diamond saw .",

    "the scan was started after sweeping the magnetic field to zero .",
    "the temperature of the liquid nitrogen bath was recorded prior to and after the scans and was found to be , increasing due to oxygen uptake by about during the measurement .",
    "the resistive offset of the hall probe was determined at the end of each measurement , with the hall probe still immersed in liquid nitrogen , but at a large distance from the bulk .    a somewhat wider scanning area of was used for the magnetoscans .",
    "this precaution was taken to assure that the magnet would not produce artefacts by stopping over the bulk after finishing a single line of the scan .",

    "( the black rectangles indicate the cubes cut for magnetometry . ) ]      assuming that the variation of the critical current over the sample thickness can be neglected immediately implies that the trapped field profiles recorded on the bottom and top surface are identical , which was confirmed by the experiment .",
    "the maxima of the trapped field were equal within one percent on both sides of the bulk and found to be .",
    "strong negative fields of up to were detected close to the edge of the sample , which result from the high diameter to thickness aspect ratio of the disk ( cf .",

    "the high reproducibility between several measurements shows that the gap between the hall probe and the sample surface ( ) remains unchanged in subsequent runs .",
    "the inversion of the trapped flux density profile of the bottom surface of the disk is depicted in figure  [ fig : all_comp]b .",
    "most of the bulk carries a current density of around in the remanent state .",
    "the defects ( blue arrows ) close to the edge appear as regions , where the critical current is drastically reduced , most likely due to cracks or large scale inclusions . a remarkable result of the inversion is the detection of the @xmath12-growth sector at the center of the bulk .",
    "it is clearly displayed in the current density map as a rectangular area with low critical current density ( green region ) .",
    "in addition , a clear negative correlation between the critical current density and the magnitude of the perpendicular magnetic induction @xmath21 is found , for example close to one of the @xmath32@xmath32 growth sector boundary , where both the magnetic field and the current density change simultaneously ( small white arrows ) .",
    "the correlation is most prominent at low fields , i.e. high current densities of up to flow close to the sample edge , where the magnetic induction changes sign and therefore @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , a point inside the bulk ( lowest white arrow ) with reduced magnetic induction is reproducibly detected , where the current density significantly exceeds the nearby current densities .",
    "this demonstrates that a strong field dependence of the critical current is present , especially at low fields .      due to the strong field dependence of the critical current , it is difficult to compare different regions of the bulk , as the self - field of the bulk is position - dependent in the remanent state .",
    "contrary , in the magnetoscan the background field of the permanent magnet is constant and the self - field is smaller , since the currents are activated only in an area of about the magnet s",
    "diameter  @xcite .",
    "all except one of the prominent defects are found in the magnetoscan ( cf .",
    "[ fig : all_comp]c ) .",
    "a possible explanation would be a large defect or inclusion at a depth , which exceeds the penetration depth of the permanent magnet .",
    "similar to the inversion , the reduction of the critical current is evident from the low magnetic response in the @xmath12-axis growth sector .",
    "moreover , the observable granularity on a sub - mm scale of the bulk s response indicates strong local variations in the critical current density .",
    "( _ a _ ) @xmath34 correlation from the inversion , showing the average field dependence of the critical current density .",
    "the magnetisation @xmath35 data is similar to the smoothed data from the current calculation ( green line ) for high fields .",
    "the curves differ at low fields , because the self - field is not taken into account in the @xmath35 data of the cubes .",
    "further , the critical currents vary also from sample to sample in the magnetisation data ; the cubes cut from the seed area show the lowest critical current density .",
    "( _ b _ ) evaluation of the hysteresis loop for cube # 1 taking the self - field into account . the field generated by the supercurrents in the sample shifts the applied magnetic induction to higher fields ( arrow ) , resulting in a @xmath2 dependence , which is now similar to the average data obtained from the current calculation .",
    "there is no indication for a flattening of the curve at small fields . ]",
    "the calculated current densities can be correlated with the @xmath1-component of the magnetic induction at their position . for this purpose",
    "the magnetic induction in the central plane inside the bulk was calculated after the inversion ( see the appendix ) , resulting in a @xmath2 plot ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : jcb_comp ] ) .",
    "only points with positive induction @xmath36 were considered , which effectively cuts off the noise due to the extended defects close to the sample edge .    for comparison four cubes ( @xmath37 ) were cut from different positions of the bulk ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : all_comp]c ) and analysed in a squid magnetometer at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen bath during the previous scans .",
    "the magnetisation loops were evaluated assuming the bean model .",
    "a large sample to sample variation was found , at this point the lowest critical current density being located at the @xmath12-axis growth sector in the center of the bulk ( cubes # 3 and # 4 ) , in agreement with the above results . although numerical errors in the inversion procedure ( mainly due to the numerical derivation ) can not completely be excluded , the variation in the magnetisation data elucidates the scatter in the calculated current densities , if one takes into account that the averaged volume is much larger in the squid measurements .",
    "this suggests that the scatter is primarily due to strong local variations of the critical current in the bulk , which is further supported by the granularity observed in the magnetoscan signal ( cf .",
    "[ fig : all_comp]c ) .",
    "the average field dependence of the critical current density from the magnetisation loops @xmath35 shows good agreement with @xmath2 obtained from the trapped flux density maps , except at low fields , where the curves clearly differ ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : jcb_comp]a ) . this can be explained in terms of the sample s self - field , which is not considered in the evaluation of the magnetisation experiment , since it takes only the externally applied field @xmath38 into account and neglects the field generated by the currents flowing in the sample .    to estimate",
    "this contribution the magnetoscan signal serves as a first approximation , because the currents are induced in an area determined by the magnet s diameter and the volume of current flow mainly contributing to the magnetoscan signal is therefore similar to the cubes used in magnetometry .",
    "indeed the average induction of the magnetoscan ( ) is close to the field , where the @xmath35 and @xmath2 start to differ .    for a more detailed analysis",
    "an evaluation method was applied ( again based on the bean model ) , which accounts for both the externally applied field and the mean self - field in the sample , thus providing an approximate @xmath2 dependence @xcite . especially for low applied fields , where self - field effects become dominant , the evaluation shifts all data points to higher fields ( cf .",
    "[ fig : jcb_comp]b ) .",
    "this effect is particularly clear for the remanent state at zero applied field ( arrow ) , where the magnetic induction is solely due to the trapped self - field .",
    "consequently , a sample can not be probed at zero magnetic induction by squid magnetisation experiments .    when accounting for the self - field contribution , good agreement between the @xmath2 curve from the squid loops and the average @xmath2 curve from the inversion is found in the range accessible to the magnetisation experiment ( depicted in figure  [ fig : jcb_comp]b for one of the cubes ) . moreover ,",
    "the field , where the correction starts to become effective and the self - field becomes important , is equal to the simple estimate made above using the magnetoscan data ( ) .",
    "in contrast to squid magnetometry , the current calculation allows one to analyse the @xmath2 dependence in fields ranging from zero induction to the maximum trapped field .",
    "a clear dependence of the critical current density on the magnetic induction @xmath21 is revealed in this way .",
    "there is no indication for a flattening in the average @xmath2 at low fields .",
    "the inversion of the biot - savart law represents an ill conditioned problem for bulk superconductors , but parameters , e.g. the step width of scan and the thickness of the sample , can be found , which allow its application to thin disks cut from the sample .",
    "the matrix equation was solved without any additional assumptions by a fast algorithm , which exploits the symmetry of the problem . in this way , for example the @xmath12-axis growth sector was clearly identified as a distinct region of low critical current density , a result , which is also obtained by the magnetoscan and confirmed by magnetisation measurements .    from a technological point of view both methods , the magnetoscan and the inversion of the flux density map , are complementary .",
    "the magnetoscan provides information on the local critical current density at a certain constant background field , which is of interest for superconducting bearings .",
    "on the other hand , information about the remanent current flow at the bulk s self - field is important for magnet applications and can be obtained by the inversion of the trapped flux density map of thin disks cut from the sample .",
    "in addition , the current calculation was found to provide the important average field dependence of the critical current also at low fields ( below the self - field ) , a region , which is not accessible to magnetic measurements , even if the self - field is explicitly accounted for in the evaluation procedure .",
    "there is no indication of a plateau in @xmath2 and the critical current density is found to depend on the field in a continuous way also at the lowest magnetic inductions .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : atwo ] ) defines @xmath42 apart from a gradient field and an arbitrary constant , which are both chosen to be zero .",
    "consequently @xmath42 vanishes outside the sample and can therefore be interpreted as a magnetisation , which is confined to the sample volume and establishes the current density @xmath44 by spatial variations .",
    "ampere s law results now in a homogeneous equation for the field @xmath45                  the planar @xmath1-independent current flow can be represented by @xmath51 and consequently the first term vanishes since @xmath52 in the sample volume .",
    "further , only the surfaces perpendicular to @xmath42 contribute to the second term . using ( [ eqn : asix ] ) the measured induction @xmath21",
    "is expressed solely as a function of @xmath10        note , that @xmath45 vanishes for the case of an infinitely long slab ( zero demagnetisation ) as @xmath57 in  ( [ eqn : aseven ] ) . in this case",
    "the induction is simply determined by the magnitude of @xmath42 at a certain position and @xmath58 inside and @xmath59 outside the slab , where @xmath60 . however , for finite geometries there will always be a contribution from @xmath45 in ( [ eqn : aseven ] ) and the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath42 is non - local .",
    "therefore the integral equation ( [ eqn : aseven ] ) must be solved in order to attain @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding set of linear equations for the discrete measured data is formulated by approximating the sample as an array of cubes with constant @xmath10 .",
    "summing over all elements results in the matrix equation              once the components @xmath65 are obtained by inverting  ( [ eqn : aeight ] ) , the current density can be calculated by employing  ( [ eqn : atwo ] ) .",
    "further , the induction at any distance @xmath13 outside the sample can be obtained from  ( [ eqn : aeight ] ) .",
    "note , that the magnetic induction @xmath21 in the central plane ( @xmath66 ) of the sample , which is needed to obtain @xmath2 , is given by                              http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/niconet 2008 according to the online manual subroutine ` mb02ed ` uses `` householder transformations , modified hyperbolic rotations and block gaussian eliminations in the schur algorithm to solve the linear equation '' .",
