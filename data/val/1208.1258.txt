    "recently , the whispering - gallery - atom system inspires a lot of interest wga1,wga2,wga3,wga4,theo1,theo2,theo3,theo4,theo5,theo6,theo7 , owing to its broad applications in the studies of quantum optics .",

    "subsequently , the single - photon transports in the whispering - gallery system have been extensively studied @xcite .        in this paper , we study the two - photon transport property of this system shown in fig .",

    "<S> the free pathway does not contribution to correlated two - photon processes . in the presence of intermodal mixing , </S>",
    "<S> the system no longer exhibit a free resonant pathway . instead , both the single - photon and the two photon transport properties depend on the position of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the presence of intermodal mixing one can in fact tune the photon correlation properties by changing the position of the atom . </S>",
