    "the accelerating expansion of the present universe discovered in 1998 is one of the most important puzzles yet to be solved  @xcite .",
    "its solution hopefully will lead us to a new revolution in physics of this century . a positive cosmological constant , as a geometrical and/or an energy component of the universe , gives the simplest explanation that fits the current observational results .",
    "in addition , an energy source of anti - gravity dubbed `` dark energy '' and the modification of gravity provide two intriguing approaches to the solution  @xcite .    a simple realization of dynamical dark energy is given by a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity , where the cosmic acceleration is driven by potential energy  @xcite or noncanonical kinetic energy  @xcite of the scalar field . for an alternative explanation from modified",
    "gravity one may introduce new degrees of freedom , modify the gravity action , or even change the formalism .",
    "a simple extension of general relativity ( gr ) in the first scenario is to introduce a scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity , e.g. , the scalar - tensor theory  @xcite .",
    "models with non - minimal derivative couplings have also been proposed  @xcite . for the second scenario",
    "a straightforward modification is to invoke a nonlinear function of the ricci scalar in the gravity action to replace the linear function in gr , i.e. , the @xmath0 theory  @xcite that can be regarded as one of the scalar - tensor theories . as to the change of the formalism , an example is teleparallel gravity that is formulated with torsion and a curvatureless connection .",
    "teleparallel gravity can be equivalent to gr when the gravity action invokes simply a linear function of the torsion scalar . to make an extension of teleparallel gravity as modified gravity , i.e.  inequivalent to gr ,",
    "one may follow the two scenarios raised above .",
    "a simple extension can be made by introducing a scalar field non - minimally coupled to teleparallel gravity .",
    "this can be regarded as a `` scalar - teleparallel theory '' of gravity , a modification of teleparallel gravity analogous to the scalar - tensor theory as a modification of gr .",
    "it has recently been proposed as an alternative dark energy model  @xcite and dubbed `` teleparallel dark energy . '' for the other scenario a straightforward modification of the gravity action can be made by invoking a nonlinear function of the torsion scalar , i.e. , the @xmath1 theory ( for a review , see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on teleparallel dark energy .",
    "the distinct behavior of dark energy in this model has been investigated in @xcite where several different potential terms for the self - interaction of the scalar field are chosen . for lack of a guiding principle of choosing the self - potential , in this paper",
    "we propose the simplest model with no potential .",
    "that is , we investigate the `` minimal '' model of teleparallel dark energy where the scalar field is canonical , massless and noninteracting but non - minimally coupled to teleparallel gravity . with this simple model we attempt to manifest the effect of the non - minimal coupling on the cosmic acceleration , in contrast to the conventional models that attribute the acceleration to potential energy or noncanonical kinetic energy .    in this model",
    "we find the analytic solutions of the scalar field in the radiation , matter , and dark energy dominated eras , respectively .",
    "these solutions largely facilitate the theoretical studies on the dark energy behavior and help to reveal various interesting features of this model .",
    "in addition to the analytic solutions , we also numerically analyze this model and illustrate possible evolution patterns .",
    "as to be shown , the numerical solutions truly manifest the features read from the analytic solutions .",
    "we then present the observational constraint of this model obtained by the data fitting with the type ia supernova ( snia )  @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao )  @xcite , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite observational results .",
    "teleparallel dark energy is played by a canonical scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity in the framework of teleparallel gravity , which is formulated with the veirbein field @xmath2 , the metric deduced from veirbein @xmath3 , the curvatureless weitzenbck connection @xmath4 , and the corresponding torsion tensor @xmath5 the action of teleparallel dark energy reads @xmath6 , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the torsion scalar defined by @xmath9 @xmath10 is the scalar field , @xmath11 the self - potential , @xmath12 the matter lagrangian , and @xmath13 the non - minimal coupling constant . in this paper",
    "we investigate the simplest model free of self - potential , i.e. , hereafter @xmath14 . for a flat , homogeneous and isotropic background",
    "where the space - time is described by the flat robertson - walker metric @xmath15 and the scalar field is simply time - dependent , the scalar field and the gravitational field equations @xcite read @xmath16 where the matter energy density @xmath17 , the radiation energy density @xmath18 , and the energy density and pressure of the scalar field are given by @xmath19 we note that for @xmath20 , the non - minimal coupling may result in negative pressure , thereby anti - gravity , and meanwhile a positive energy density . in particular , the contribution from the term @xmath21 entails the cosmological - constant equation of state @xmath22 and the other term @xmath23 provides no energy density but negative pressure when @xmath24 increases with time .",
    "henceforth we consider the case where @xmath20 in order to guarantee the positiveness of the energy density .",
    "we set the present scale factor @xmath25 for convenience and without loss of generality .",
    "here we present the analytic solutions of the scalar field in two cases : ( a ) the case where @xmath26 , including the radiation - dominated ( rd ) and matter - dominated ( md ) eras , and ( b ) the scalar - field - dominated ( sd ) era .    * ( a ) @xmath27 , i.e.  @xmath28 , with constant @xmath29 : * @xmath30 where @xmath31 are constants and @xmath32 .",
