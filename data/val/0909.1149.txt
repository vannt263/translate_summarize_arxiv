    "the no - signaling principle , one of the no - go theorems in quantum theory , asserts that information can not be sent faster than light .",

    "we derive an explicit formula that non - signaling probability distributions have to fulfill , by which a bound to the minimum - error state discrimination among quantum states can be obtained .",

    "our work provides a systematic way to compute an upper bound to the success probability in the minimum - error state discrimination @xcite .",
    "although quantum state discrimination is one of basic operations to estimate and characterize capabilities of tasks in quantum information theory , the optimal minimum - error discrimination is known for few cases such as two - state or symmetric states discrimination @xcite . here , our method gives a bound to the minimum - error state discrimination among high - dimensional states for which the optimal discrimination is not known yet .    on the other hand , in the fundamental point of view",

    "first , from two facts that i ) the no perfect cloning holds for all non - signaling theories having bell violations @xcite and ii ) quantum theory is non - local @xcite , it is clear that the no - signaling principle in quantum theory immediately implies that perfect quantum cloning is not possible @xcite . to be quantitative ,",
    "it was shown that the optimal cloning fidelity can be obtained by the no - signaling principle @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum cloning generally converges to the optimal state estimation in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "however , the connection between the state estimation and the no - signaling is only qualitative so far through the above mentioned connection : the no - signaling principle implies that the perfect cloning is not possible , and therefore the state estimation can not be perfectly done either . along these lines",
