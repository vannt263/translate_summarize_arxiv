    "<S> this paper presents a thorough evaluation of a bistable system versus a matched filter in detecting bipolar pulse signals . </S>",
    "<S> the detectability of the bistable system can be optimized by adding noise , i.e.  the stochastic resonance ( sr ) phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> this sr effect is also demonstrated by approximate statistical detection theory of the bistable system and corresponding numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the performance comparison results between the bistable system and the matched filter show that ( a ) the bistable system is more robust than the matched filter in detecting signals with disturbed pulse rates , and ( b ) the bistable system approaches the performance of the matched filter in detecting unknown arrival times of received signals , with an especially better computational efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> these significant results verify the potential applicability of the bistable system in signal detection field . </S>"
