    "recent development of information and communication technology empowers us both to collect and analyse a large amount of data on socio - economic systems .",
    "several researchers refer to the present epoch driven by this technological changes as _ the information explosion era _  @xcite .",
    "this progress enables us to monitor many details of financial assets and to record the information as a high frequency multivariate time series .",
    "recently , investigations of foreign exchange rates have been conducted by numerous researchers using various approaches based on statistical physics and time series analysis  @xcite .",
    "drod et al .",
    "showed that exchange rate return fluctuations for main currency pairs are well described by non - extensive statistics and possess multifractal characteristics  @xcite .",
    "rebitzky studied the influence of macroeconomic news on exchange rates  @xcite .",
    "he concluded the following three points : ( 1 ) fundamental news do matter , ( 2 ) news influences exchange rates by incorporating common information into prices directly and indirectly based upon order flow and ( 3 ) the impact of fundamental news on exchange rates is fairly stable over time .",
    "kaltwasser  @xcite estimated the herding tendency in the foreign exchange market for three currency pairs using the extended alfrano - lux model  @xcite and computed several unconditional moments of corresponding daily log - returns .",
    "gworek et al .",
    "analysed the exchange rate returns of 38 currencies ( including gold )  @xcite .",
    "they examined the cross - correlations between the returns of various currency pairs as well as between their signs , and in this way , they constructed a corresponding minimal spanning tree for several base currencies .",
    "liu et al . applied cross - sample entropy ( cross - sampen ) to compare two different time series in order to asses their degree of asynchrony to the daily log - return time series of foreign exchange rates in the currency markets  @xcite .",
    "they compared the correlations between time series with cross - sampen and showed that cross - sampen is superior in describing the correlations .",
    "moreover , theoretical models  @xcite and empirical analysis  @xcite on the tick - by - tick data of the foreign exchange market have been considered .",
    "ohnishi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a weighted - moving - average analysis for the tick - by - tick data of yen - dollar exchange rates .",
    "they concluded that the weights decay exponentially with a time scale less than 2 min , implying that dealers are watching only the very recent market state .",
    "hashimoto and ito examined market impact of japanese macroeconomic statistic news within minutes of their announcements on the yen - dollar exchange rates  @xcite .",
    "they found clear increases in the number of deals and price volatility immediately after such announcements .    in principle , information arrivals can be never observed comprehensively ; however , one can register quotations(transactions ) from market participants .",
    "perceived information determines investor attitude , but the impact of news on trading decisions is an open question  @xcite .    nevertheless , we believe that it is important to confirm whether correlations exist between the number of quotations and transactions . in this study , we focus on the number of quotations or transactions for several currency pairs quoted in the foreign exchange market and we treat them as a multivariate time series that characterise system dynamics . bonanno et al . investigated the spectral density of both the logarithm of prices and the daily number of trades of a set of stocks traded in the new york stock exchange",
    "they confirmed the @xmath1 behaviour of the spectral density of stocks log - returns and detected a @xmath2-like behaviour of the spectral density of daily trade numbers .",
    "this shows that the number of transactions is generated by a long memory process , similar to the volatility dynamics .",
    "more conceptually , the mixture distribution hypothesis is one of the most famous explanatory models for price fluctuations in the financial market  @xcite .",
    "specifically , there is a positive simultaneous correlation between transaction volume , or the number of transactions , and returns  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mandelbrot - taylor  @xcite and clark  @xcite proposed the concept of time changes or subordinated processes in order to explain the fat - tailedness of returns .",
    "it was reported that the number of trades is profoundly related to volatility .",
    "according to the normal variance mixture models in finance  @xcite , despite of the heteroskedacity of volatility with long memory , unconditional distribution of log - returns can be fitted to the mixture of normal distributions with an unconditional distribution of volatility .",
    "the same theory has been recently proposed in statistical physics by beck to investigate superstatistics  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to capture the cross - sectional structure of quotations and transactions to understand their volatility .    in studies on financial time series , several researchers have taken the stance that traded volume , or the number of transactions ( quotations ) , is a proxy variable for unobservable information arrivals on market participants  @xcite .",
    "researchers of econophysics focus on several types of scaling relationships observed in the financial markets in order to understand the behaviour of market participants  @xcite .",
    "specifically , a scaling relationship between mean values of money flow and their standard deviation ( `` taylor s power law '' or `` fluctuation scaling '' ) is a useful scaling relationship when conducting multi - dimensional analysis on financial markets .",
    "a scaling relationship between a mean of constituents flows at the @xmath3-th observation point @xmath4 and their standard deviation @xmath5 is referred to as fluctuation scaling : @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents a positive constant , and @xmath8 is a scaling exponent taking a value ranging from 1/2 to 1 .",
    "the pioneering work on fluctuation scaling is known as a taylor s study in ecology  @xcite .",
    "after his study , the scaling relationship between means and standard deviations has been found in a wide spectrum of fields .",
    "recently , menezes and barbasi have reported the scaling relationship on traffic flows , river flows and browsing activities of internet  @xcite .",
    "eisler and kertsz investigated fluctuation scaling of the traded value and dependence of the scaling exponent on a time scale  @xcite .",
    "more recently they computed the scaling relationship of the traded volume for 2647 stocks listed in the new york stock exchange ( nyse )  @xcite and 4039 listed in the nasdaq in the taq database , which records all transactions of the nyse and nasdaq during the period from 2000 to 2002 .",
    "they found a clear scaling relationship at these stock markets .",
    "they clarified that the hurst exponents and the scaling exponents depend on the window length .",
    "eisler et al . investigated fluctuation scaling on the volumes traded in the stock exchange market .",
    "furthermore , some researchers have examined cross - correlations among various quantities of the financial markets  @xcite .",
    "podobnik et al .",
    "investigated volume growth rate and volume changes for 14,981 daily records of the standard and poor s ( s&p ) 500 index over a 59-year period ( 1950 - 2009 )  @xcite . using detrended cross - correlation analysis , they found that there are power - law cross - correlations between them .",
    "bonanno et al .",
    "studied correlation - based network analysis of financial equities  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether a stable scaling relationship exists in the foreign exchange market .",
    "this is the first focus of our paper .",
    "following the taylor methodology , we examine the scaling relationship between the mean of the numbers of quotations and transactions and their variance .",
    "we suppose that there should exist a relationship between fluctuation scaling for the market activity and cross - correlations at the foreign exchange market .",
    "this is the second focus of this article .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : empirical - analysis ] , we analyse the scaling exponents and cross - correlation matrices for a selected period . in sec . [",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to concluding remarks and used to address future works .",
    "in this section , we focus on the number of quotations arriving at the matching engine of the ebs platform and the number of transactions occurring there per unit time .",
    "we use comprehensive data ( icap ebs data mine level 1.0 ) collected by the ebs platform , one of the most popular electronic brokerage systems , which is exploited by over 2,000 traders at about 800 dealing rooms across the globe  @xcite .",
    "the data include records for orders ( bid / offer ) and transactions of currencies and precious metals during a period from june 2007 to december 2010 ( 43 months )  . during this period ,",
    "the global financial system suffered from the following significant macroeconomic shocks and crises : ( i ) paribas shock ( aug . 2007 ) , ( ii ) bear stearns shock ( feb . 2008 ) , ( iii ) sub - prime crisis driven by lehman shock ( sep .",
    "2008 to mar . 2009 ) and ( iv ) euro crisis ( apr . to may 2010 ) .",

    "this scaling law means that currency pairs with a low ( high ) mean activity show small ( large ) activity fluctuations .",
    "values of scaling exponents @xmath35 can be estimated by using the least squared method applied to the equation : @xmath36    figure [ fig : emp - fs ] shows double logarithmic plots for standard deviations of quotations or transactions numbers against their mean values for investigated currency pairs during a selected period .",

    "the behaviour of residuals computed from the transaction activities is similar .",
    "however , the scaling relationship of the transaction activities is more stable than that of the quotation activities before or after the shocks .",
    "in addition , we compute the global average of the cross - correlation coefficients .",
    "the bootstrap standard deviations are approximately 0.1 during all observation periods .",
    "we found that the global average of simultaneous cross - correlations for quotation activities takes values less than 0.4 until february 2009 .",

    "this significant increase coincides with scaling breaking of quotation activities . from this result",

    "we examined fluctuation scaling , the global averages of cross - correlation coefficients for both quotation and transaction activities and the global average of cross - correlation coefficients between them .",
    "we found that the scaling relationship between the mean of the numbers of activities and their variance is stable for a long observation period .",
    "however , we also observed that the scaling relationship breaks during several periods .",
    "specifically , the scaling breaking was observed from may to june 2009 .",
    "this may be related to imbalance between demand and supply of the foreign exchange market .",
    "the reason for this is an open question .",
    "we further found that there is a relationship between the exponents of fluctuation scaling and the global average of simultaneous cross - correlation coefficients .",
    "the relationship was found for both different window lengths and different observation periods .",
    "the scaling exponents have a positive association with the global average of cross - correlations .",
    "these values may measure the degree of the synchronous behaviour of participants .",
    "moreover , we recognised that the global average of cross - correlations between the quotation activities and transaction activities rapidly inclined after august 2009 .",
    "the occurred just after the significant scaling breaking of the quotation activities .",
    "the scaling breaking may be related to drastic changes in participants perception of the market .    in future research , the relationship between trends of exchange rates and scaling exponents could be explored .",
