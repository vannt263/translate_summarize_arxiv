    "with the aim to build up a classically singularity - free theory of the electron , that is a theory in which infinite physical quantities are avoided , born and infeld @xcite proposed a model in which additional terms or modifications of the standard electrodynamics were included .",
    "to prevent the infinite self energy of point particles ( as follows from standard electrodynamics ) , they introduced an upper limit on the electric field strength and considered the electron as an electric particle with finite radius . in successive investigations , other examples of nonlinear electrodynamics lagrangians were proposed by plebanski , who also showed that born - infeld model satisfy physically acceptable requirements @xcite .",
    "consequences of nonlinear electrodynamics have been studied in many contexts , such a , for example , cosmological models @xcite , black holes and wormhole physics @xcite , and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "recently , the nonlinear electrodynamics has been also invoked as an available framework for generating the primordial magnetic fields in the universe @xcite .",
    "the latter , indeed , is a still open problem of the modern cosmology , and although many mechanisms have been proposed , this issue is far to be solved .",
    "seed of magnetic fields may arise in different contexts , e.g. cosmological phase transitions of the early universe @xcite , string cosmology @xcite , inflationary models of the universe @xcite , nonminimal electromagnetic - gravitational coupling @xcite , gauge invariance breakdown @xcite , density perturbations @xcite , gravitational waves in the early universe @xcite , lorentz violation @xcite , cosmological defects @xcite , electroweak anomaly @xcite , temporary electric charge nonconservation @xcite , trace anomaly @xcite , parity violation of the weak interactions @xcite , biermann type battery seed effect @xcite .",
    "once these seeds are generated , they must be amplified by means of some mechanism .",
    "promising candidates are the dynamo mechanism @xcite and the protogalactic collapse and differential rotation @xcite .",
    "the first mechanism allows an enhancement of the ( preexisting ) magnetic strength from @xmath2 g to @xmath3 g , the present ( observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters ) strength , the second one instead allows an amplification from @xmath4 g to @xmath3 g . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of magnetic fields in the universe has important cosmological consequences as , for example , the generation of anisotropies in cmb @xcite , and the primordial abundances of the light elements [ big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ] @xcite .    in this paper , besides to study the amplification of primordial magnetic fields in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics , we also discuss the possibility that nonlinear electrodynamics might provide a framework for the so - called _ gravitational _ baryogenesis .",
    "the latter is related to the origin of the baryon number asymmetry , which is , as well known , a still open problem of the particle physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "bbn @xcite and measurements of cmb combined with the large structure of the universe @xcite indicate that the order of magnitude of such an asymmetry is @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the baryon ( antibaryon ) number density , and @xmath8 the entropy of the universe .",
    "conventionally , the necessary requirements for a ( cpt invariant ) theory able to generate the baryon asymmetry are dictated by sakharov s conditions @xcite : 1 ) there must exist processes that violate the baryon number ; 2 ) the discrete symmetries c and cp must be violated ; 3 ) departure from thermal equilibrium . however , none of the sakharov s conditions is obligatory @xcite .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite , a dynamical violation of cpt ( which implies a different spectrum of particles and antiparticles ) may give rise to the baryon number asymmetry also in a regime of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we study the amplification of the primordial magnetic fields in the framework of the nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "we shall investigate the case in which the lagrangian is of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are free parameters . in section iii , after a short review of the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism @xcite",
    ", we investigate the possibility to generate , during the radiation dominated era , the observed baryon asymmetry if effects of nonlinear electrodynamics are taking into account .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of the amplification of primordial magnetic fields and of the gravitational baryogenesis for the nonlinear electrodynamics whose lagrangian is of the form @xmath13 .",
    "conclusions are shortly discussed in section v.",
    "in this section we shall study the amplification of the primordial magnetic field for the case in which the electromagnetic field is described by a nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "the lagrangian density we consider is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are free parameters that with appropriate choice reproduce the well know lagrangian already studied in literature .",
    "@xmath11 has dimensions [ energy]@xmath15 .",
    "the case @xmath16 and @xmath17 corresponds to the standard linear electrodynamics . the primordial magnetic field in nonlinear electrodynamics has been studied recently by kunze @xcite and campanelli et al .",
    "@xcite . their study refer mainly during the inflationary era of the universe evolution .",
    "our approach follows the paper @xcite , in which the electromagnetic field evolution is analyzed during the de sitter , rehating and radiation dominated eras .",
    "moreover , we derive a wave equation for the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath18 .",
    "in the seminal paper by turner and widrow ( tw ) @xcite , it was suggested that a magnetic field might be generated by quantum fluctuations during an inflationary epoch , and it could be sustained after the wave length of interest crossed beyond the horizon giving the observed field today @xcite .",
    "this model invokes a coupling among the electromagnetic field and the scalar ( @xmath19 ) and ( ricci and riemann ) tensor curvatures , which break the conformal invariance . according to tw paper ,",
    "since the universe is a good conductor ( during its evolution ) , one expects that the magnetic flux is preserved even if the primordial magnetic field evolves .",
    "this physical behavior suggests the definition of the parameter @xmath20 , which remains ( with good approximation ) constant and provides an invariant measure of the magnetic field strength . here",
    "@xmath21 is the energy density of the magnetic field , and @xmath22 is the energy density of the cosmic microwave background radiation . in order to explain the present value of @xmath23 for galaxies , one needs a pre - galactic magnetic field which corresponds to @xmath24 if dynamo amplifications are invoked , and @xmath25 if the galactic magnetic fields are generated , in the collapse of the protogalactic cloud , by means of the compression of the primordial magnetic field . in the last case ,",
    "the dynamo processes are not necessary ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the action we consider is the electromagnetic field minimally coupled to gravity @xmath26 the nonlinearity breaks the conformal invariance , which is the necessary condition for amplifying the primordial magnetic fields ( in fact , the minimal coupling of electromagnetic fields to a four - dimensional background is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric ; therefore , the time evolution of the conformally flat metric , as the friedamn - robertson - walker metric , does not affect the electromagnetic fluctuations , and no amplifications occur ) .",

    "in this approximation , all spatial derivatives will be neglected ( long wave - length approximation ) .",
    "moreover , we shall assume that the direction of the magnetic field is fixed .",

    "in this paper we have studied the amplification of the magnetic field and the origin of the baryon asymmetry in the framework of the nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "in particular we have analyzed lagrangian densities of the form @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    ", reheating and radiation dominated eras , we have found that the amplification of the primordial magnetic field occurs provided that the parameter @xmath12 falls in the range @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the analysis has been performed also for the origin of the baryon asymmetry occurring during the radiation dominated era .",
    "as concerns the model proposed by novello - bergliaffa - salim , with @xmath125 , the analysis of the amplification of the primordial magnetic fields shows that the required values @xmath101 , necessary for explaining the observed galactic magnetic fields , is obtained provided that the electromagnetic nonlinear terms turn on at the reheating era , but are zero at the de sitter epoch .",
    "in conclusion , the nonlinear electrodynamics , which is the reduction in the abelian sector of an effective model of the low energy ( 3 + 1)-qcd @xcite , seems a promising candidate for studying cosmological scenarios which go beyond the standard cosmology and particle physics .",

    "<S> the amplification of the primordial magnetic fields and the gravitational baryogenesis , a mechanism that allows to generate the baryon asymmetry in the universe by means of the coupling between the ricci scalar curvature and the baryon current , are reviewed in the framework of the nonlinear electrodynamics . to study the amplification of the primordial magnetic field strength , we write down the gauge invariant wave equations and then solve them ( in the long wavelength approximation ) for three different eras of the universe : de sitter , the reheating and the radiation dominated era .    constraints on parameters entering the nonlinear electrodynamics are obtained by using the amplitude of the observed galactic magnetic fields and the baryon asymmetry , which are characterized by the dimensionless parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .    </S>",
