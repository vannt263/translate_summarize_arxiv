    "originally formulated in 1970 , the belinskii - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture states that as one approaches a space - like singularity , ` terms containing time derivatives in einstein s equations dominate over those containing spatial derivatives ' @xcite .",
    "this implies that einstein s partial differential equations are well approximated by ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , whence the dynamics of general relativity effectively become local and oscillatory .",
    "the time evolution of fields at each spatial point is well approximated by that in homogeneous cosmologies , classified by bianchi @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these are the bianchi i metrics which have no spatial curvature and the bianchi ii metrics which have ` minimal ' spatial curvature . according to the bkl conjecture ,",
    "the dynamics of each spatial point follow the ` mixmaster ' behavior a sequence of bianchi i solutions bridged by bianchi ii transitions .",
    "finally , with the significant exception of a scalar field , matter contributions become negligible to quote wheeler , ",
    "matter does nt matter \" .    in the beginning",
    ", the conjecture seemed to be coordinate dependent and rather implausible .",
    "however , subsequent analysis by a large number of authors has shown that it can be made precise and by now there is an impressive body of numerical and analytical evidence in its support @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that we are still quite far from a proof of the conjecture in the full theory .",
    "but there has been outstanding progress in simpler models .",
    "in particular , berger , garfinkle , moncrief , isenberg , weaver and others showed that , in a class of models , as the singularity is approached the solutions to the full einstein field equations approach the ` velocity term dominated ' ( vtd ) ones obtained by neglecting spatial derivatives @xcite . andersson and",
    "rendall @xcite showed that for gravity coupled to a massless scalar field or a stiff fluid , for every solution to the vtd equations there exists a solution to the full field equations that converges to the vtd solution as the singularity is approached , _ even in the absence of symmetries_. these results were generalized to also include @xmath0-form gauge fields in @xcite . in these vtd models",
    "the dynamics are simpler , allowing a precise statement of the conjecture that could be proven . in the general case ,",
    "the strongest evidence to date comes from numerical evolutions .",
    "berger and moncrief began a program to analyze generic cosmological singularities @xcite . while the initial work focused on symmetry reduced cases @xcite , more recently garfinkle @xcite",
    "has performed numerical evolution of space - times with no symmetries in which , again , the mixmaster behavior is apparent .",
    "finally , additional support for the conjecture has come from a numerical study of the behavior of test fields near the singularity of a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .    with growing evidence for the bkl conjecture ,",
    "it is natural to consider its implications to quantum gravity .",
    "the conjecture predicts a dramatic simplification of general relativity near space - like singularities , which are precisely the places where quantum gravity effects are expected to dominate .",
    "a promising approach to analyze this issue is provided by loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite where there are now several indications that the quantum gravity effects become important only when curvature or matter density are about a percent of the planck scale .",
    "therefore it is quite possible that , generically , spatial derivatives become negligible compared to the time derivatives already when the universe is sufficiently classical . in this case a quantization of the effective theory with odes , that descends from techniques applicable in the full theory , could provide a reliable qualitative picture of quantum gravity effects near generic space - like singularities .",
    "if , on the other hand , the bkl behavior sets in only in the planck regime , this strategy would not be viable .",
    "but since there is no reason to trust einstein s equations in this regime , then the conjecture would also not have a physically interesting domain of validity .",
    "lqc is the result of application of the principles of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite to symmetry reduced cosmological models .",
    "initial study of the k=0 friedmann lemaitre robertson walker ( flrw ) models revealed that the quantum geometry effects underlying lqg provide a natural mechanism for the resolution of the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "subsequent more complete analysis led to a detailed understanding of the physics in the planck regime and also showed that although these effects are very strong there capable of replacing the big bang with a quantum bounce they die extremely rapidly so as to recover general relativity as soon as the curvature falls below planck scale @xcite .",
    "these results were then extended to include spatial curvature in @xcite and a cosmological constant in @xcite .",
    "more recent investigations reveal that if matter satisfies a non - dissipative equation of state @xmath1 , lqc resolves all strong curvature singularities of the flrw models , including , e.g. , those of the ` big - rip ' or ` sudden death ' type @xcite .",
    "also , it is now known in lqc that the bianchi i and ii and ix singularities are resolved @xcite .    in view of the bkl conjecture ,",
    "these results , together with further support from the ` hybrid ' quantization of gowdy models @xcite , suggest that there may well be a general theorem to the effect that all space - like singularities of the classical theory are naturally resolved in lqg .",
    "however , it is difficult to test this idea using the current formulations of the bkl conjecture since these approaches are motivated by the theory of partial differential equations rather than by hamiltonian or quantum considerations ( see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in particular , most approaches perform a rescaling of their dynamical variables by dividing by the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "it is difficult to promote the resulting variables to operators on the lqc hilbert space . in the analysis presented here",
    ", we reformulate the bkl conjecture in a way better suited to lqc and explore the resulting system both analytically and numerically",
    ".    in lqg one begins with a first order formalism where the basic canonical variables are a density - weighted triad and a spin - connection @xcite .",
    "in section [ s2 ] we will begin by recalling this hamiltonian formulation of general relativity . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we rewrite this theory using a set of variables that are motivated by the bkl conjecture .",
    "rather surprisingly , the core of this theory can be formulated using ( density weighted ) fields with only internal indices ; _ space - time tensors never feature _ ! to understand the implications of the bkl conjecture to lqg , we need to express the conjecture using this hamiltonian framework .",
    "this task is carried out in section [ s4 ] .",
    "we provide a weak and a strong version of the conjecture .",
    "the key idea is to say that , as one approaches space - like singularities , the exact system is well approximated by a truncated system which features only time derivatives .",
    "non - triviality of the formulation lies in the choice of variables and specification of how limits are taken .",
    "our procedure satisfies a number of stringent requirements .",
    "in particular , one can either first truncate the hamiltonian and then obtain the equations of motion or first obtain the full equations of motion and then truncate them ; the two procedures commute . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we study the truncated hamiltonian system and explore its dynamics in some detail .",
    "we show that it exhibits all the known features such as the ` u - map ' and spikes .",
    "thus , _ the hamiltonian framework we were led to by lqg considerations successfully captures the mixmaster dynamics faithfully .",
    "_ therefore , in addition to providing a viable point of departure to analyzing the fate of generic space - like singularities in lqg , it should also be useful in analytical and numerical investigations of the bkl conjecture in classical general relativity itself . in section [ s6 ]",
    "we summarize the main results and comment on their relation to those of other works .",
    "the two appendices contain more technical material .",
    "appendix [ a1 ] introduces densities in a coordinate - free manner .",
    "this notion is important because the basic variables in our formulation of the bkl conjectures are scalar densities of weight 1 . in the main text , for simplicity",
    "we have set the shift and the lagrange multiplier of the gauss constraint equal to zero .",
    "appendix [ a2 ] contains the full equations without these restrictions .",
    "we will consider space - times of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a compact , oriented 3-dimensional manifold ( without boundary ) .",
    "we will formulate general relativity in terms of first order variables , the point of departure of lqg @xcite .",
    "these consist of pairs of fields consisting of a ( density weighted ) orthonormal triad , @xmath4 and its conjugate momentum @xmath5 which on solutions will correspond to extrinsic curvature .",

    "the basic variables @xmath27 used there are obtained by a simple canonical transformation on @xmath13 @xcite : ( ^a_i , k_a^i ) ( a_a^i,^-1 _ a^i ) a_a^i = _ a^i + k_a^i , @xmath28 being the barbero - immirzi parameter of lqc .",
    "( in classical general relativity , space - time equations of motion are independent of the value of this real parameter . ) for simplicity of presentation we will introduce our formulation of the bkl conjecture using @xmath29 although it will be clear that our framework can be readily recast in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "in order to formulate the bkl conjecture in this system , one needs to specify two things : what kind of derivatives are to dominate as one approaches the singularity and what kind are to become negligible ? and , what are the quantities whose derivatives are to be treated as negligible ? in this section we first motivate and introduce a set of variables and a derivative operator and then use them to formulate the conjecture .",
    "the main idea is as follows .",
    "the accumulated evidence to date suggests that the spatial metric @xmath14 becomes degenerate at the space - like singularity whence its determinant @xmath15 vanishes there .",
    "( in particular , this is borne out in the numerical simulations of solutions with two commuting killing fields the so - called @xmath31 space - times which include gowdy models @xcite . )",
    "we will focus on the class of singularities where this occurs . in this case",
    "one would expect that if we rescaled fields which are ordinarily divergent at the singularity with appropriate powers of @xmath15 , the rescaled quantities would have well defined limits .",
    "now , the density weighted triad @xmath4 is obtained by rescaling of the orthonormal triad @xmath32 , which is divergent at the singularity , by @xmath33 . in examples ,",
    "the factor of @xmath33 not only gives @xmath4 a well defined limit , but the limit in fact vanishes .",
    "therefore , contraction by @xmath4 can serve to tame fields which would otherwise have been divergent at the singularity .",
    "this consideration leads us to construct scalar densities by contracting @xmath4 with @xmath5 , and @xmath34 . as noted above , since contraction with @xmath4",
    "will suppresses the divergence of @xmath5 and @xmath34 , the combination is expected to remain finite at the singularity .",
    "let us then set [ cp ] _",
    "i^j & : = ^a_i k_a^j - ^a_k k_a^k _ i^j + _ i^j & : = ^a_i _ a^j - ^a_k _ a^k _ i^j . these two fields ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 will turn out to be the relevant variables near the singularity in our bkl framework .",
    "in particular , we will show below that the constraints of general relativity can be expressed in terms of polynomials of these basic variables and their derivatives .",
    "therefore if the basic variables and their derivatives remain finite at the singularity , the constraints will also continue to hold there .",
    "since the hamiltonian of the theory is a linear combination of these constraints , dynamics of the basic variables will meaningfully extend to the singularity .    beyond the possibility of being bounded at the singularity ,",
    "an important feature of these variables is that they have _ only internal indices _ which can be freely raised and lowered using the fixed , kinematic , internal metric @xmath37 ; the dynamical metric @xmath38 which diverges at singularities is not needed . under diffeomorphisms @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "transform as density weighted _ scalars _ on @xmath3 .",
    "because of this feature , statements about their asymptotic properties can be formulated much more easily than would be possible if they were tensor fields .",
    "( for a coordinate free introduction to densities , see appendix [ a1 ] ) . to illustrate why these variables are likely",
    "to be well defined at the singularity , let us consider the bianchi i model . because of spatial flatness , we can work in an internal gauge in which @xmath39 everywhere .",
    "what about @xmath4 and @xmath40 ? in terms of the commonly used proper time @xmath41 ,",
    "the metric is given by @xmath42 and the singularity occurs at @xmath43 . since @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 in the bianchi i chart .",
    "in addition , due to the second constraint on the exponents , @xmath46 whence the density weighted triad @xmath4 vanishes at the singularity as @xmath47 and @xmath48 is finite there for each @xmath49 .",
    "we further introduce a derivative operator @xmath50 defined by the contraction of @xmath26 with @xmath4 : _ i : = ^a_i d_a .",
    "the expectation is that this contraction will have the effect of suppressing terms containing @xmath50 as we approach the singularity .",
    "thus , @xmath50 will be the spatial derivatives we were seeking which , when acting on certain quantities , will be conjectured to be negligible near the singularity .",
    "is non - trivial only on tensor indices ) .",
    "however since its action on a function @xmath51 does not yield the exterior derivative @xmath52 , @xmath50 is not a connection . if we were to formally treat as a connection , it would have torsion , which is related to @xmath53 : @xmath54 } f = -\\tilde{t}^k_{\\;\\;ij } \\dt_k f $ ] where @xmath55}^{\\;\\;l}$ ] . in",
    "what follows , @xmath56 often acts on scalar densities .",
    "this action is given explicitly in appendix [ a1 ] . ]",
    "the variable @xmath57 is related to the momentum @xmath58(conjugate to the 3-metric ) in the adm phase space by @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 encodes information in the @xmath50 spatial derivatives of the triad @xmath4 : [ ga ] ^ij = - _",
    "^klj _ k ^a_l .",
    "note that , although the @xmath60 depend on spatial derivatives of the triad and are often sub - dominant to @xmath57 , it turns out that they are not always negligible in the approach to the singularity .",
    "indeed , this behavior is observed in the truncated system , which is discussed in section [ s4 ] .",
    "it is @xmath61 rather than the triads themselves that will feature directly in our formulation of the conjecture .    for simplicity of notation ,",
    "_ from now on we will drop the tildes . _",
    "thus , from now on each of @xmath62 carries a density weight @xmath63 , while the lapse field @xmath64 carries a density weight @xmath10 .",
    "the scalar and the vector constraint functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( introduce below ) carry density weight 2 while the gauss constraint @xmath67 carries density weight 1 .    by making use of ( [ cp ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) ,",
    "functions of @xmath68 and their covariant derivatives can be rewritten in terms of @xmath69 and their @xmath70 derivatives .",

    "( for non - zero shift , see appendix [ a2 ] . )",
    "note that the equation of motion for @xmath73 is a simple ode .",
    "note also that , as was the case with constraints , the equations of motion for @xmath71 and @xmath77 can again be written in terms of scalar densities and the derivative @xmath70 _ only_.",
    "this motivates us to ask for an evolution equation for the derivative operator @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath56 ignores internal indices , it suffices to consider its action just on scalar densities @xmath80 of weight @xmath81 .",
    "we have : [ ddot1 ] _",
    "i s_n = [ _ i ( n )]s_n - n _i^j_j s_n . _ thus we have cast all the constraint as well as evolution equations as a closed system involving only _",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath77 , and @xmath70 .",
    "these equations can then be used as follows . on an initial slice ,",
    "we construct @xmath82 from a pair @xmath83 of canonical variables .",
    "then we can deal exclusively with the triplet @xmath84 .",
    "the pair @xmath83 satisfies constraints if and only if the triplet satisfies ( [ s1])([g1 ] ) .",
    "given such a triplet , we can evolve it using ( [ cdot1]),([pdot1]),([ddot1 ] ) _ without having to refer back to the original canonical pair _ @xmath83 .",
    "these two sets of equations have some interesting unforeseen features .",
    "first , as already mentioned , the basic triplet @xmath85 has _ only internal indices _ : our basic fields are _ scalars _ on @xmath3 ( with density weight 1 ) .",
    "it would be of considerable interest to investigate if this fact provides new insights into the dynamics of 3 + 1 dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "second , these equations _ do not refer to the triad _ @xmath73 .",
    "suppose we begin at an initial time where @xmath86 is derived from an @xmath73 .",
    "then these constraint and evolution equations ensure that @xmath86 _ is derivable from a triad at all times_. furthermore , we can easily construct that triad directly from a solution @xmath87 to these equations : first solve ( [ cdot1])([ddot1 ] ) and then simply integrate the ode [ edot ]",
    "^a_i = -n p_i^j e^a_j at the end .",
    "third , the structure of the constraint and evolution equations in terms of @xmath85 is remarkably simple since only low order polynomials of these variables are involved .",
    "finally , thanks to our rescaling by @xmath33 , our basic triplet @xmath88 ( as well as @xmath73 ) are expected to have a well behaved limit at the singularity .",
    "a close examination of our equations shows that they allow the triad become to become degenerate during evolution .",
    "so , strictly ( as in lqg @xcite ) we have a generalization of einstein s equations .    to summarize",
    ", we have found variables which remain finite at the singularity in examples and rewritten einstein s equations as a _ closed system of differential equations _ in terms of them .",
    "therefore , this formulation may be useful for proving global existence and uniqueness results and rigorous exploration of fields near space - like singularities . finally ,",
    "although for simplicity we have set shift @xmath89 and the smearing field @xmath19 equal to zero , the features we just discussed hold more generally ( see appendix [ a2 ] ) .    to conclude ,",
    "let us examine the action of the vector and the gauss constraints on our basic variables .",
    "( the action of the scalar constraint yields the evolution equations which we have already discussed . )",
    "since the vector constraint generates a combination of spatial diffeomorphisms and internal rotations , it is standard to subtract a multiple of the gauss constraint to define the diffeomorphism constraint : [ diff ] v_i = v_i - 2(_i^j - _ i^j ) g_j we can then smear both constraints to obtain g [ ] = _ ^3 m ^k g_k v[n ] = _ ^3 m n^i v_i where @xmath89 s a scalar with density weight @xmath10 so that @xmath90 is the standard lapse and , as before , @xmath91 has density weight zero .",
    "the action of @xmath92 $ ] on the basic variables is given as usual via poisson brackets : [ gt1]\\{p_ij , g [ ] } & = & _ klj ^l p_i^k + _ kli ^l p^k_j + [ gt2 ] \\",

    "similarly , the action of the diffeomorphism constraint is given by the poisson brackets : [ vt1]\\ { p_i^j , v[n ] } & = & -2(n^k d_k p_i^j + p_i^j d_k n^k + p_i^j _ klm n^k c^lm ) = -2 _ p_i^j + [ vt2 ] \\",

    "we see that the constraint generates diffeomorphisms as expected with @xmath40,@xmath86 , and @xmath95 transforming as scalar densities . again ,",
    "note that the infinitesimal changes generated by each constraint involve _ only _ the basic variables @xmath71 , @xmath96 , and @xmath70 .",
    "thus there is still a closed system in terms of this set of variables .",
    "in order to express the bkl conjecture we must make more precise the arena in which it is to be applied .",
    "the ingredients we need are a space - time with a space - like singularity , a notion of ` spatial ' and ` temporal ' derivatives , and specification of the system to which the conjecture is to be applied .",
    "we make use of the framework introduced in the previous section to provide this arena .",
    "let us begin with a 4-manifold , @xmath97 admitting a smooth foliation @xmath98 parameterized by a time function , @xmath99 . we restrict ourselves to a slicing of @xmath97 in which the space - like singularity lies on the limiting leaf .",
    "this ensures that we can reasonably discuss an approach to the singularity as approaching the limiting leaf .",
    "the time function @xmath99 labeling our spatial slices is intertwined with the choice of lapse and shift .",
    "we will assume that the lapse @xmath64 and the shift @xmath89 , _ each with density weight _ @xmath10 , admit a smooth limit as one approaches the singularity .",
    "since the spatial metric @xmath100 becomes degenerate at the singularity , the commonly used lapse function @xmath101 ( with density weight zero ) goes to zero , thus placing the singularity at @xmath102 .",
    "( these assumptions are minimal and further constraints on admissible foliations may well be needed in a more complete framework . )",

    ".    the gauss constraint continues to generate internal rotations , but , whereas in the full theory @xmath86 transforms as ( the contraction of the triad with ) a connection , after truncation both @xmath86 and @xmath40 transform as @xmath9 tensors .",
    "the vector constraint also generates internal rotations , since the diffeomorphism constraint generates only negligible terms .",
    "we arrived at the truncated equations of motion by first obtaining the full equations and then applying the truncation to them i.e. , by setting spatial derivative terms to zero .",
    "but we could also have first truncated the constraints to obtain ( [ s2])- ( [ g2 ] ) and then computed their truncated poisson brackets with the basic variables .",
    "this leads to a consistency check of our scheme : do the two procedure yield the same ` truncated equations of motion ' in the end ?",
    "the answer is in the affirmative . this fact is illustrated by the following ` commutativity diagram ' :    @xmath116    note that the operation of truncation , the final truncated system , and hence the consistency requirement mentioned above depends crucially on one s choice of basic variables and notions of space and time derivatives . for example , if we had adopted the more ` obvious ' strategy and used triads @xmath73 rather than @xmath71 as basic variables , we would have been led to set @xmath71 to zero in the truncation procedure since @xmath71 would then be derived quantities , obtained by taking the @xmath56 derivative of @xmath73 .",
    "this truncation would have led us just to bianchi i equations .",

    "it is rather striking that the variables @xmath87 automatically satisfy these rather stringent criteria .",
    "in this section we will analyze the truncated system in some detail and show that its solutions reproduce the expected bkl behavior .",
    "the section is divided into three parts . in the first we regard @xmath117 as fields on the full phase space @xmath13 ,",
    "obtain the truncated poisson brackets between them and truncated constraints . in the second we solve and gauge fix the vector and the gauss constraints of the truncated theory .",
    "the result is a finite dimensional , reduced phase space with a single constraint which is well suited to serve as a starting point for quantization inspired by the bkl conjecture .",
    "in the third part we discuss several features of solutions to this hamiltonian theory .",
    "in particular , we will find that they exhibit bianchi i phases with bianchi ii transitions .",
    "since the truncated equations of motion can be formulated entirely in terms of @xmath117 , let us truncate the poisson brackets ( [ pb2 ] ) , ( [ pb3 ] ) we obtained between them by setting the negligible terms on the right side to zero . since the full poisson bracket ( [ pb3 ] ) involves smearing fields @xmath118 and @xmath119 we first need to specify which terms involving them are to be regarded as negligible .",
    "the most natural avenue is to construct to @xmath118 and @xmath119 only from the basic fields @xmath120 ( and their @xmath56 derivatives ) .",
    "then the terms containing @xmath70 derivatives of the smearing fields will also be negligible and hence vanish in the truncation .",

    "k^l(y ) } _ t & = & 0 . these poisson brackets suffice to determine the equations of motion because the truncated hamiltonian constraint ( [ s2 ] ) is algebraic in @xmath86 and @xmath40 .",

    "first , we have a _ closed system _ expressed entirely in terms of @xmath121 and @xmath122 at any fixed point @xmath123 .",
    "furthermore , the equations of motion ( [ cdot2 ] ) and constraints ( [ s2])-([g2 ] ) are at most quadratic in these variables . in the full theory",
    ", the triad does not appear explicitly in the equations ( [ cdot1 ] ) - ( [ ddot1 ] ) but is implicitly present through @xmath70 . upon truncation , even this implicit dependence disappears .",
    "second , as in the full theory , one can first solve the equations of motion for @xmath121 and @xmath122 and then evolve the triad at that point at the end by solving an ode .",
    "third , the truncated scalar constraint ( [ s2 ] ) is symmetric under interchange of @xmath71 and @xmath77 and , by adding a multiple of the gauss constraint , the vector constraint can be made anti - symmetric under this interchange : [ vred ] |v^i_(t ) : = ^ijk _ j^l _ kl .",
    "however , this symmetry is broken at the level of equations of motion because the truncated poisson algebra does not have a simple transformation property under this interchange .",
    "because fields at distinct points decouple , to study the truncated system from the viewpoint of differential equations , one can simply restrict oneself to a single spatial point . however , this is not directly possible in the hamiltonian framework because even in the truncated theory , the poisson brackets ( [ tpb1 ] ) , ( [ tpb2 ] ) involve @xmath124 .",
    "but one can introduce a _ subspace _",
    "@xmath125 of the full phase space @xmath13 tailored to our truncation .",

    "the phase space point will be said to be _ homogeneous _ if there exists an internal gauge and a nowhere vanishing scalar density @xmath126 of weight @xmath10 such that the ( density weight zero ) scalar fields @xmath127 are constants on @xmath3 ( and @xmath113 } = 0 $ ] ) .",
    "( fixing a @xmath128 is equivalent to fixing a 3-form on @xmath3 ; see appendix [ a1 ] . ) clearly , the truncated dynamics leaves this _ homogeneous sub - space _ @xmath125 of the phase space invariant .",

    "the hamiltonian dynamics on @xmath125 fully captures the truncated dynamics at any fixed spatial point on @xmath3 .    _",
    "remark : _ since the triads @xmath73 in the full phase space @xmath13 have been assumed to be non - degenerate , they are also non - degenerate in @xmath125 .",
    "however , as examples suggest , one would expect them to be become degenerate in the limit to the space - like singularity where , however , @xmath117 would continue to be well behaved ( and some of them may even vanish ) .",
    "it is therefore of some interest to extend the homogeneous subspace by adding ` limit points ' which have this behavior .",
    "this construction is not needed in our analysis . however , since it may be useful in future investigations , we will conclude this subsection with a brief summary .",
    "let us allow the density weighted triads @xmath73 to become degenerate such that the subspaces spanned by the non - degenerate directions of vector fields @xmath129 are integrable .",
    "( if this condition is satisfied for one nowhere vanishing scalar density @xmath126 , it is satisfied for all . )",
    "thus , in the degenerate case we obtain preferred 2 or 1 dimensional sub - manifolds on @xmath3 .",
    "we can extend the phase space by including such degenerate @xmath73 if , in addition , the resulting pair @xmath87 is regular , @xmath107 is symmetric and the pair @xmath130 is homogeneous along the preferred lower dimensional sub - manifolds of @xmath3 .",
    "key questions for the bkl conjecture are then : i ) does the hamiltonian flow on @xmath13 naturally extend to this extension ? ; and ii ) do generic dynamical trajectories flow to it ?      since @xmath107 is symmetric but @xmath131 is not , the homogeneous subspace @xmath125 is not a symplectic sub - manifold of the full phase space @xmath13 .",
    "but it turns out that one can obtain a symplectic manifold by solving and gauge fixing the truncated vector and the gauss constraints .",
    "it will be referred to as the _ reduced phase space _ , @xmath132 .",

    "fix the gauss constraint , we first note the transformation properties ( [ gt1 ] ) and ( [ gt2 ] ) of @xmath40 and @xmath86 under the action of the gauss constraint .",
    "it is easy to verify that , because @xmath40 and @xmath86 commute , the requirement that they both be diagonal gauge - fixes the gauss constraint completely .",
    "it turns out that the diagonality requirement also fixes the vector constraint .",
    "this may seem surprising at first .",
    "but note that the combination @xmath133 of the vector and the gauss constraint of eq ( [ vred ] ) again generates internal gauge rotations , where , however the generator @xmath91 is a ` q - number ' , i.e. , depends on the phase space variables : @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the shift used to smear the vector constraint .",
    "the fact that the gauge fixing of the vector constraint does not impose additional requirements on @xmath136 ` cures ' the mismatch in the degrees of freedom in the homogeneous subspace ( arising from the fact that while @xmath107 is symmetric , @xmath137 is not . ) .",

    "as is well known , these spikes were found in numerical simulations and , more recently , also in analytical treatments @xcite .",
    "whenever spikes appear , the key assumption underlying bkl truncation is brought to question because the spatial derivatives are large at the spikes .",
    "the key issue for the bkl conjecture and for the application to quantum gravity we proposed in section [ s1] is whether the time derivatives still dominate generically , as they do in examples .",
    "let us summarize .",
    "using analytical and numerical methods we showed that there exists a well defined subspace @xmath125 of the full phase space @xmath13 which exhibits exactly the properties expected in the bkl conjecture .",
    "our procedure to arrive at the reduced system is more direct than those available in the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "for example , elimination of the off - diagonal components and the anti - symmetric parts of @xmath107 involves an additional assumption , beyond ignoring spatial derivatives in favor of time derivatives : these quantities are identified as part of the ` stable subset ' ( variables that are expected to decay rapidly as the singularity is approached ) and then set to zero to obtain the truncated equations . in our treatment , on the other hand , the fact that the antisymmetric part of @xmath107 is negligible is directly implied by the assumption that the @xmath70 derivatives are negligible and the constraints _ imply _ that the variables @xmath107 and @xmath131 can be simultaneously diagonalized which , furthermore , completely fixes the gauge .",
    "thus , our hamiltonian framework naturally led to a diagonal gauge , enabling us to quickly zero - in on the essential variables and eliminating the need to keep track of the dynamics of extraneous variables involving frame rotations @xcite .",
    "finally , the framework easily led us to the mixmaster behavior a series of bianchi i phases interspersed by bianchi ii transitions .",
    "we recovered the ` u - map ' for these transitions , and observed the behavior expected from the andersson and rendall analysis @xcite when a scalar field of large enough magnitude is introduced .",
    "we began with the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity underlying lqg where the basic fields are spatial triads @xmath73 with density weight 1 , spin connections @xmath25 they determine , and extrinsic curvatures @xmath5 .",
    "based on examples that have been studied analytically and numerically , it seems reasonable to expect that the determinant @xmath15 of the spatial metric @xmath14 would vanish and the trace @xmath221 of the extrinsic curvature would diverge at space - like singularities .",
    "( this expectation is in particular borne out in the numerical simulations of g2 space - times @xcite . )",
    "one can therefore hope to obtain quantities which remain well - defined at the singularity either by multiplying the natural geometric fields by suitable powers of @xmath15 or dividing them by suitable powers of @xmath221 . in the commonly used framework due to uggla",
    "et al @xcite , one chooses to divide by @xmath221 .",
    "one first introduces the so - called hubble normalized triad @xmath222 by rescaling the orthonormal triad @xmath32 by @xmath223 , and then constructs a set of hubble normalized fields by contracting @xmath224 and @xmath225 with @xmath222 .",
    "these fields are expected to have regular limit at the space - like singularity .",
    "einstein s equations expressed in terms of them naturally suggests a truncation and the truncated system successfully describes the expected oscillatory bkl behavior .",
    "the resulting form of the bkl conjecture is supported by numerical evolutions of full general relativity carried out by garfinkle @xcite . however , because there is no underlying hamiltonian framework , this approach does not easily lend itself to non - perturbative quantization . even if such a framework were to be constructed , because of the presence of the @xmath223 factor , it would be difficult to introduce quantum operators corresponding to the hubble rescaled fields .",
    "motivated by quantum considerations , we adopted the complementary strategy of multiplying geometrical fields by @xmath33 .",
    "the lqg hamiltonian formulation we began with already features a density weighted triad with _",
    "exactly _ the desired property : @xmath226 . since @xmath33 is expected to vanish at the singularity , one can hope to use @xmath73 in place of the hubble normalized @xmath227 to construct a new set of fields to formulate the bkl conjecture .",
    "indeed , ( modulo trace terms ) our basic variables @xmath86 and @xmath40 were obtained simply by contacting the spatial indices of @xmath224 and @xmath228 by @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath73 vanishes in the limit , the operator @xmath229 provided a key tool in the formulation of the bkl conjecture : asymptotically , @xmath230 and @xmath115 should become ` negligible ' relative to @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "now , in exact general relativity , time derivatives of @xmath86 and @xmath40 can be expressed in terms of their @xmath56 derivatives , purely algebraic ( and at most quadratic ) combinations of @xmath86 and @xmath40 , the lapse @xmath64 and its @xmath56 derivatives ( see ( [ s1])([ddot1 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , if in the limit the @xmath56 derivatives of the basic fields become negligible compared to the fields themselves , we are naturally led to conclude that time derivatives would dominate the spatial derivatives .",
    "this chain of argument led to our formulation of the bkl conjecture .",
    "this rather simple idea depends on the fact that the structure of einstein s equations has an interesting and unanticipated feature : as we saw in section [ s3 ] , once the triplet @xmath233 is constructed from the triad @xmath73 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath5 on an _ initial slice _ , the constraint and evolution equations can be expressed entirely in terms of the triplet .",
    "given a solution to these equations , the spatial triad @xmath73 ( and hence the metric @xmath14 ) can be recovered at the end simply by solving a total differential equation ( [ edot ] ) .",
    "this is a surprising and potentially deep property of einstein s equation .",
    "it played essential role in our formulation of the bkl conjecture and could well capture the primary reason behind the bkl behavior observed in examples and numerical simulations .",
    "since our framework is developed systematically from a hamiltonian theory , its bkl truncation naturally led to a truncated phase space .",
    "the specific truncation used has an important property : the truncated constraint and evolution equations on the truncated phase space coincide with the truncation of full equations on the full phase space . on the truncated phase space",
    "we could solve and gauge - fix the gauss and vector constraints to obtain a simple hamiltonian system ( which encompasses all bianchi type a models ) .",
    "solutions to this system were explored both analytically and numerically .",
    "we showed that they exhibit the bianchi i behavior , the bianchi ii transitions and spikes as in the analysis of symmetry reduced models @xcite and numerical investigations of full general relativity @xcite .",
    "therefore , as explained in section [ s1 ] , an appropriate quantization of the truncated system , e.g. , a la loop quantum cosmology , could go a long way toward understanding the fate of generic space - like singularities in quantum gravity .    in sections",
    "[ s3 ] , [ s5.1 ] and [ s5.2 ] , we restricted ourselves to vacuum equations .",
    "the addition of a massless scalar field is straightforward and was carried out in the reduced phase space framework in section [ s5.3 ] . if the energy density in the scalar field is small , one again has bianchi ii transitions and spikes .",
    "however , once the energy density exceeds a critical value , these disappear and the asymptotic dynamics at any spatial point is described just by the bianchi i model with a scalar field without transitions .",
    "thus , our truncated system faithfully captures the main features generally expected from the analysis of andersson and rendall @xcite in full general relativity coupled to a massless scalar field or stiff fluid .",
    "thus , although the initial motivation came from quantum considerations , _ our formulation of the bkl conjecture , and the form of the field equations both in the full and truncated versions , should be useful also in the analytical and numerical investigations of singularities in classical general relativity .",
    "_    we will conclude with a discussion comparing our approach with that of uggla , ellis , wainwright and elst ( uewe ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hubble normalized variable used in their formulation of field equations are give by [ hn1 ] _ ij & = & 3k^-1 e^a_(i k_|a|j ) - k^-1 e^a_k k_a^k _",
    "ij + [ hn2 ] n_ij & = & -3k^-1 e^a_(i _ |a|j ) + 3k^-1 e^a_k _ a^k _",
    "ij + [ hn3 ] a_i & = & -_i^jk 3k^-1 e^a_j _ a^k + [ hn4 ] _ i & = & 3k^-1 e^a_i _ a .these variables are especially useful because they are scale invariant : they are unchanged under a constant rescaling of the space - time metric . because of this property and because of the ` regulating ' factor @xmath223 in their expressions , it is hoped that in the limit as one approaches the space - like singularity , these variables will remain finite @xcite and their @xmath234 derivative will become negligible .",
    "we began with quite a different motivation and our focus was on constructing a hamiltonian framework rather than on differential equations . since our emphasis was on constructing phase space variables that can be readily promoted to well - defined quantum operators , from the start we avoided the use of factors such as @xmath235 .",
    "as a result , our basic variables @xmath86 and @xmath40 are _ not _ scale invariant .",
    "could we have made a different choice which is also well suited for quantization and at the same time enjoyed scale invariance ?",
    "the answer is in the negative for the following reason . under constant conformal rescalings @xmath236 of the space - time metric",
    ", we have @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 .",
    "now , in the analysis of approach to singularity , scale invariant quantities are directly useful only if they are space _ scalars _ and it is _ not _ possible to construct scale invariant scalars using just sums of products of these fields , i.e. , without introducing fields such as @xmath223 for which it is difficult to construct quantum operators .",
    "even if one introduces additional non - dynamical fields , such as fiducial frames to construct scalars , for natural choices of these frames , scale invariant components of fields such as @xmath240 typically diverge at the singularity .",
    "thus , with our motivation , it does not seem possible to demand scale invariance of the basic variables that are to feature in the bkl conjecture .",
    "our viewpoint is that the most important feature of the hubble normalized variables is that although the orthonormal triad @xmath32 typically diverges as one approaches a space - like singularity , @xmath221 diverges even faster , making the combination @xmath241 go to zero at the singularity .",
    "furthermore , it goes to zero at a sufficient rate for its contraction with @xmath242 and @xmath243 in ( [ hn1 ] )  ( [ hn4 ] ) to tame the a priori divergent behavior of these fields . instead of dividing the orthonormal triad @xmath32 by @xmath221 which one expects to diverge at the singularity ,",
    "our strategy was to multiply it by the volume element @xmath33 which , in examples , goes to zero at the singularity .",
    "this difference persists also in the treatment of the lapse .",
    "the uewe framework assumes that the ( scalar ) lapse @xmath244 is such that @xmath245 admits a limit @xmath246 while we assume that the density weighted lapse @xmath247 admits a well - defined limit at the singularity .",
    "thus , in both cases , the standard scalar lapse @xmath244 goes to zero so the singularity lies at @xmath102 .",
    "the key scale invariant uewe variables @xmath248 which are expected to be well behaved at the singularity are related to our @xmath249 via n_ij = 6 p^-1 c_(ij)&and & _ ij = -6 p^-1 p_(ij ) + 2 _ ij , , + c_(ij ) = - n_ij & and & p_(ij )",
    "= ( _ ij - 2 _ ij ) and the two sets of lapse fields are related by : = k n .if one focuses only on the structure of differential equations near space - like singularities , the two reduced systems would in essence be equivalent if @xmath250 admits a finite , nowhere vanishing limit at the singularity .",
    "this condition holds for bianchi i models and also bianchi ii which describe the transitions between bianchi i epochs .",
    "in fact in the bianchi i model , @xmath251 and our density weighted triad has the _ same _ dependence on proper time as the hubble normalized triad .",
    "thus , although the motivations , starting points and procedures used in the two frameworks are quite different , surprisingly , in the end the basic variables and equations are closely related .",
    "we would like to thank woei - chet lim , alan rendall , yuxi zheng and especially david garfinkle and claes uggla for discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nsf grant phy0854743 and the eberly and frymoyer research funds of penn state .",
    "since the basic variables that feature in our formulation of the bkl conjecture are scalars on @xmath3 of density weight 1 , in this appendix we briefly recall a coordinate independent framework for describe densities .",
    "the underlying idea is due to wheeler and the detailed framework was developed by geroch ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this framework goes hand in had with penrose s abstract index notation @xcite .",
    "because the primary application in this paper is to our fields @xmath117 on @xmath3 we will focus on scalar densities on 3-manifolds .",
    "but generalization to tensor densities on n - manifolds is straightforward .",
    "fix an oriented 3-manifold @xmath3 and fix a orientation thereon .",
    "denote by @xmath252 the space of smooth , positively oriented , no - where vanishing , totally skew tensor fields @xmath253 on @xmath3 . clearly , given any two elements @xmath253 and",
    "@xmath254 in @xmath252 , there exists a ( strictly ) positive function @xmath255 such that @xmath256 .",
    "this fact will be used repeatedly .    in this paper , a scalar density @xmath80 of weight @xmath81",
    "is a map from @xmath252 to the space of ( real valued ) smooth functions on @xmath3 : @xmath257 , such that : s_n(e^ ) = ^n s_n(e ) here @xmath81 can be any real number but in most applications in general relativity it is an integer .",
    "( in quantum mechanics , on the other hand , states are ( complex - valued ) densities of weight @xmath258 on the configuration space @xcite . )",
    "since @xmath259 have density weight @xmath63 , let us make a short detour to discuss the case @xmath260 .",
    "fix any 3-form @xmath261 on @xmath3 .",
    "it determines a canonical scalar density of weight @xmath63 : s_1(e ) : = s_abc e^abc .",
    "conversely , since @xmath128 is a linear mapping from @xmath252 to smooth functions , it determines a canonical 3-form @xmath261 .",
    "thus , our basic variables could also be taken to be 3-forms @xmath262 on @xmath3 which take values in second rank tensors in the internal space .",
    "the standard adm phase space of general relativity can be similarly coordinatized by positive definite metrics @xmath14 and tensor fields @xmath263 which are symmetric in @xmath264 and totally skew in @xmath265 @xcite .",
    "finally note that every metric @xmath14 determines a canonical volume 3-form @xmath266 which has positive orientation and satisfies @xmath267 .",
    "therefore it also determines a canonical scalar density @xmath33 of weight @xmath63 , called the _ square root of the determinant _ of @xmath14 : @xmath268 for all @xmath269 .",
    "this definition can be extended to density weighted tensor fields in an obvious fashion .",
    "note that every @xmath3 carries a natural totally skew tensor density @xmath270 of weight @xmath63 , called the levi - civita density : ^abc ( e ) = e^abc e given any metric @xmath14 on @xmath3 , the square root of its determinant , @xmath33 , can also be expressed as @xmath271 .",
    "finally , given a derivative operator @xmath26 on tensor fields on @xmath3 , we can extend its action on densities @xmath80 of weight @xmath63 in a natural manner .",
    "@xmath272 is a 1-form with the same density weight @xmath81 , given by ( d_a s_n)(e ) = d_a ( s_n(e ) ) - n _ a s_n(e ) e , where the first term on the right hand side is just the gradient of the function @xmath273 and the 1-form @xmath274 is given by @xmath275 .",
    "therefore the action of the derivative operator @xmath56 introduced in the main text is given by : ( d_i s_n)(e ) = d_i(s_n(e ) ) - n ( e^a_i_a ) s_n(e)e .",
    "since the derivative operator @xmath26 we considered ignores internal indices , this equation gives the action of @xmath56 on @xmath86 and @xmath40 by regarding these basic fields simply as scalar densities with weight @xmath63 .",
