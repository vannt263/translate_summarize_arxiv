    "in a warm , magnetized kinetic plasma , the dissipation of low - frequency turbulent fluctuations by kinetic mechanisms occurs most strongly at length scales of order the plasma particle larmor radii .",
    "if turbulence is driven in the plasma at a much larger scale , an inertial range develops in which the injected energy is cascaded by nonlinear interactions to the small scales at which the turbulence can be effectively dissipated .",
    "this transfer of turbulent energy through an inertial range from the driving scale to dissipative scales followed by the conversion of this energy into heat is a fundamental kinetic plasma physics process . in this paper ,",
    "i lay out a theoretical foundation on which to build our knowledge of _ inertial range turbulence in kinetic plasmas _ and outline a practical strategy for the nonlinear numerical modeling of this process .",
    "the study of turbulence in kinetic plasmas is not a new endeavor ; in magnetic fusion community , understanding the effect of turbulence on the transport properties of the plasma is one of the primary goals of the numerical modeling effort .",
    "but the turbulence most often investigated in laboratory plasmas is driven by microinstabilities arising from gradients in the background plasma  for example , ion temperature gradient ( itg ) and electron temperature gradient ( etg ) instabilities @xcite .",
    "these instabilities inject energy into the plasma at the scale of the particle larmor radius ; the resulting turbulence does not develop an inertial range because the driving and kinetic dissipation scales are of roughly the same order .",
    "inertial range turbulence in kinetic plasmas , therefore , represents a fundamentally different process than the kinetic turbulence traditionally studied by the fusion community",
    ".    the turbulence in most astrophysical contexts , on the other hand , is typically driven at scales much larger than the larmor radius and gives rise to a turbulent cascade through an inertial range to the dissipative scales at which the energy of turbulent fluctuations is ultimately converted into particle thermal energy . before constructing the detailed theoretical foundation for the study of this process , presented in sec  [ sec : theory ] , i will provide here a simplified blueprint of the physical mechanisms guiding the flow of energy .",
    "it is important to emphasize that many of the mechanisms described below are not well understood . here",
    "i aim only to paint the overall picture in broad strokes , deferring discussion of the many uncertainties to sec  [ sec : theory ] .    at a scale larger than the particle mean free path  a collisional scale for which magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) provides an adequate description  the plasma is stirred by some external mechanism , driving an assortment of mhd alfvn , fast , slow , and entropy mode fluctuations in the plasma . at this driving scale , these modes are undamped ; thus , a turbulent cascade develops nonlinearly to transfer the fluctuation energy to smaller scales .",
    "the compressive modes become damped as the cascade reaches scales of order or smaller than the collisional mean free path , but the alfvnic cascade continues undamped down to the scale of the ion larmor radius . at this kinetic scale ,",
    "the electromagnetic fluctuations may be damped collisionlessly by the landau resonance with the ions . in the absence of collisions",
    ", this process conserves a generalized energy  the free energy removed from the electromagnetic fluctuations generates nonthermal structure in velocity space of the ion distribution function .",
    "the remaining electromagnetic fluctuation energy continues to cascade below the scale of the ion larmor radius as a kinetic alfvn wave cascade . upon reaching the scale of the electron larmor radius , the electromagnetic fluctuations of the kinetic alfvn wave cascade are completely damped via the landau resonance with the electrons",
    "; again , a generalized energy is conserved in this process , leading to the creation of nonthermal structure in velocity space of the electrons .",
    "but the damping of the electromagnetic fluctuations and consequent generation of structure in velocity space does not correspond to heating ; irreversible heating requires an increase in entropy that can only be achieved by collisions .",
    "the thermalization of the turbulent energy by collisions is ultimately achieved thanks to a cascade to small scales in velocity space of the particle distribution functions  an _ entropy cascade_. the entropy cascade drives the distribution function structure in velocity space to scales small enough that even weak collisions are sufficient to smooth out that structure towards the maxwellian , causing entropy to increase  this is the final step in the conversion of the energy of the turbulent fluctuations to thermal energy of the plasma particles .",
    "the entire process described above is the kinetic generalization of the familiar cascade of energy in a fluid turbulent system ; this fundamental kinetic plasma physics process , encompassing the dual cascade in both physical and velocity space , is referred to as the _ kinetic cascade _ of the generalized energy @xcite .",
    "neither the detailed interactions of the kinetic cascade nor its implications for the flow of energy in turbulent systems are well understood ; a theoretical foundation for its study is layed out in sec  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "nonlinear numerical simulations of the kinetic cascade occurring in inertial range turbulence are expected to play a leading role in shedding light on the complex physical mechanisms involved  a strategy for the numerical approach to this problem is presented in sec  [ sec : numerics ] and initial numerical results are discussed in sec  [ sec : results ] .",
    "astrophysical and laboratory environments in which the kinetic cascade of inertial range turbulence may play an important role are identified in sec  [ sec : app ] .",
    "although inertial range turbulence plays an important role in the evolution of many kinetic plasmas , it has not yet attracted great attention within the scientific community .",
    "the physics underlying this intersection of kinetic plasmas and turbulence is fascinating yet remains poorly understood .",
    "this paper aims to construct a foundation upon which a thorough knowledge of the varied mechanisms involved may be built .",
    "i present here a view of the overall context in which the kinetic cascade operates and aim to emphasize the uncertainty underlying some aspects of this view .",
    "i begin with the assumption that the turbulence is driven at a scale @xmath0 much larger than the ion collisional mean free path , @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics at the driving scale is therefore collisionally dominated , so the single fluid magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) theory provides an adequate description of the plasma dynamics at all parallel scales @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 in this paper are relative to the direction of the local mean magnetic field ) . ] .",
    "the assumption @xmath1 will not be true for all environments in which inertial range , kinetic turbulence arises ; the implications of relaxing this assumption are discussed in sec  [ sec : other ] . based on the fact that the damping of all linear wave modes at the mhd scales @xmath3 is negligible , the damping of the turbulent fluctuations is likewise expected to be negligible ; an inertial range will then develop to cascade the turbulent energy via nonlinear interactions to ever smaller scales .",
    "this cascade will continue down to the transition from fluid to kinetic behavior at a scale @xmath6 . at this point , a fluid treatment of the turbulence is no longer adequate ",
    "instead a kinetic theory must be used to describe the dynamics .",
    "the nature of the kinetic continuation of the inertial range to scales @xmath7 depends critically on the character of the mhd turbulent fluctuations reaching this transition .    here",
    "i review five key concepts underpinning the theory of mhd turbulence before applying them to construct a model for the fluid portion of the turbulent inertial range .    1 .   the kolmogorov hypothesis : the nonlinear energy transfer is constant through all scales within the inertial range , defined as the extent of scales influenced neither by the energy injection mechanism nor by dissipation ; at a given scale , the energy transfer is spectrally local , with a rate determined only by the turbulent conditions at that scale @xcite .",
    "2 .   the kraichnan hypothesis : even in a magnetized plasma with no mean field",
    ", the magnetic field of large - scale fluctuations behaves effectively as a mean field for fluctuations on smaller scales @xcite .",
    "colliding wavepackets : as is apparent when the equations of incompressible mhd are cast into elssser form , only alfvn wave packets traveling in opposite directions along the mean magnetic field interact nonlinearly @xcite .",
    "critical balance : as strong mhd turbulence cascades to small scale , it maintains a state of balance between the ( parallel ) linear propagation and ( perpendicular ) nonlinear interaction timescales @xcite .",
    "5 .   decoupling of fast wave dynamics : theory and simulations of compressible mhd turbulence suggest that the isotropic cascade of fast mhd wave turbulence decouples from the dynamics of the alfvn , slow , and entropy modes @xcite .      adopting the kolmogorov and kraichnan hypotheses ,",
    "the interaction of oppositely directed , small - amplitude alfvn wave packets along the mean ( or large - scale ) magnetic field in incompressible mhd is considered . if it is assumed ( a ) that the nonlinear interaction between two colliding wavepackets is weak  and therefore that a single wave packet must undergo many collisions before it has been distorted enough to have effectively transferred its energy to smaller scale  and ( b ) that the energy is transferred to smaller scales _ isotropically _ , an inertial range one - dimensional energy spectrum that scales with wavenumber as @xmath8 is predicted . a spectrum with this scaling is often referred to as the iroshnikov - kraichnan spectrum @xcite",
    ".    however , evidence from laboratory plasmas @xcite , the solar wind @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite suggests that the mhd turbulent cascade is not isotropic but preferentially transfers energy to small scales perpendicular to the mean magnetic field . taking the observed anisotropy into account , anisotropic theories of mhd turbulence have been proposed and refined @xcite , and have led to the emergence of a mature theory for weak incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite . the predicted one - dimensional energy spectrum for weak incompressible mhd turbulence scales as @xmath9 ; the cascade is anisotropic , with all energy cascading to higher perpendicular wavenumbers and none to higher parallel wavenumbers . unlike the isotropic iroshnikov - kraichnan cascade , in which the nonlinear interactions weaken as the turbulence progresses to smaller scale , this anisotropic theory predicts that , as the turbulence cascades to higher perpendicular wavenumber , the nonlinear interactions strengthen , leading eventually to the inevitable violation of the assumption of weak nonlinear interactions @xcite .",
    "thus arises the most important implication of the weak turbulence theory : given a cascade through a sufficiently broad range of scales , weak incompressible mhd turbulence will inevitably transition to a state of strong turbulence .",
    "below the perpendicular scale where the perturbative treatment fails , the resulting state of strong incompressible mhd turbulence is treated phenomenologically by assuming that the turbulence maintains a state of critical balance , @xmath10 , as it cascades to smaller scales . for a linear alfvn wave frequency , @xmath11 , and a nonlinear frequency determined by the perpendicular dynamics , @xmath12 ,",
    "theory predicts a one - dimensional kinetic energy spectrum @xmath13 and a scale - dependent anisotropy @xmath14 .",
    "although numerical simulations of strong mhd turbulence with a dynamically strong mean field appear to to support the scale - dependent anisotropy @xmath14 @xcite , these same simulations routinely produce one - dimensional energy spectra that appear to scale as @xmath15 rather than @xmath16 @xcite . a modification of the theory to take into account a proposed polarization alignment",
    "@xcite may shed light on this discrepancy , but the matter of strong mhd turbulence remains controversial .",
    "it is also worthwhile noting here that the predicted transition from weak to strong mhd turbulence has only recently been numerically reproduced @xcite .    in spite of the uncertainties in the theory for the strong incompressible mhd turbulence",
    ", the combination of key concepts ( 1)(4 ) in sec  [ sec : theory ] leads to the following general prediction : in any magnetized , incompressible plasma , whether or not a strong mean field exists at the large scale , at sufficiently small scales a state of strong mhd turbulence will arise .",
    "therefore , given the assumption of sufficiently large driving scale @xmath1 , at the transition from fluid to kinetic behavior @xmath17 , the turbulent fluctuations will be dominantly perpendicular with @xmath18 and the fluctuation amplitudes will be small compared to the mean field , @xmath19 .",
    "the kinetic description of the continued turbulent cascade to smaller scales is strongly influenced by these predicted characteristics of the turbulence .",
    "the discussion thus far has been limited to incompressible mhd . in the case of compressible mhd ,",
    "an arbitrary stirring mechanism may inject energy into the compressive modes of the plasma  the fast , slow , and entropy modes .",
    "a weak turbulence treatment of compressible mhd for fast and alfvn waves suggests that only a small amount of energy is transferred from fast waves to alfvn waves at large @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of strong turbulence in compressible mhd demonstrate an isotropic cascade of fast waves that scales as @xmath21 and suggest that this cascade of fast wave energy is decoupled from the alfvn and slow wave cascades @xcite . in the region of wavevector space where the the energy of the alfvn wave cascade is concentrated , @xmath22 , the fast wave frequencies @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the sound speed , are much higher than the alfvn wave frequencies @xmath25 , so the decoupling of these cascades is not surprising .",
    "the cascade of the slow waves and entropy modes is slaved to the alfvn wave cascade @xcite and is seen to mimic the anisotropic cascade of the alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "although , from these arguments , the compressive modes of the plasma turbulence are not expected to significantly alter the behavior of the alfvn wave cascade as determined by incompressible mhd turbulence theory , this topic remains an open area of research .",
    "as the inertial range turbulent cascade enters the regime of weak collisionality at @xmath6 , the nature of the fluctuations at this transition motivates a particular choice for the kinetic description of the dynamics of the cascade to yet smaller scales .",
    "the theory of mhd turbulence described above predicts the following turbulent state at the transition : isotropic fast wave fluctuations and anisotropic alfvn , slow , and entropy mode fluctuations with @xmath18 . because both the energy of the fluctuations decreases with increasing wavenumber ( @xmath26 for fast waves and @xmath27 for alfvn , slow , and entropy modes ) and the driving scale",
    "is assumed large @xmath1 , the amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations at this scale will be small compared to the local mean field , @xmath28 .",
    "although strong nonlinear interactions dominate the turbulence  leading to the nonlinear cascade of the energy of a wave on a timescale of order the wave period  the small amplitude of the fluctuations suggests that it is not unreasonable to estimate the collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations using the damping rates from linear theory . for plasmas with @xmath29",
    ", linear theory shows that the kinetic wave modes corresponding to the fast and slow mhd wave modes are significantly damped collisionlessly at scales @xmath30 @xcite ; for lower @xmath31 plasmas , however , the damping is less vigorous .",
    "fast waves are also subject to strong dissipation as they steepen into shocks .",
    "although the argument that these wave modes are damped rapidly in the regime of weak collisionality is plausible , further exploration of this matter is required . for the remainder of this paper , i will neglect the effect of any energy in the fast wave mode ( and its kinetic continuation ) on the dynamics of the alfvn , entropy , and slow modes .    in this limit @xmath18 and @xmath28 , the kinetic turbulent dynamics of the alfvn , slow , and entropy modes",
    "is rigorously described by a low - frequency expansion of kinetic theory called gyrokinetics @xcite .",
    "exploiting the timescale separation between frequency of the turbulent fluctuations and the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath32 , gyrokinetics averages over the fast cyclotron motion of charged particles in the mean magnetic field .",
    "the gyrokinetic approximation orders out the fast mhd wave and the cyclotron resonance , but retains finite - larmor - radius effects , collisionless damping via the landau resonance , and collisions .",
    "a powerful result from gyrokinetic theory is the conservation of a generalized energy @xmath33 according to the equation @xmath34   \\\\ & = & \\int d^3{\\mathbf{r } } { \\mathbf{j}}_{a } \\cdot { \\mathbf{e } } + \\sum_s   \\int d^3{\\mathbf{v } }    \\int d^3{\\mathbf{r}}_s \\frac { t_{0s}h_s } { f_{0s } }   \\left ( \\frac { \\partial h_s}{\\partial t } \\right)_{\\mbox{c}}\\nonumber \\label{eq : consw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath35 denotes plasma species , @xmath36 is the perturbation from the maxwellian equilibrium distribution function @xmath37 with temperature @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the gyrocenter distribution function defined by @xmath40 with @xmath41 as the scalar potential , @xmath42 is an external antenna current driving the system , and @xmath43 denotes the collision operator @xcite .",
    "this relation has important implications for the flow of energy in kinetic turbulence , as discussed in detail below .",
    "the dynamics of kinetic turbulence for _ all _ scales @xmath30 is described by gyrokinetics as long as the frequency of fluctuations remains below the ion cyclotron frequency @xcite ; the failure of the gyrokinetic theory when @xmath45 is discussed in sec  [ sec : other ] .",
    "here i consider the properties of this turbulence in the kinetic regime at perpendicular scales larger than the ion larmor radius , @xmath46 or @xmath44 .",
    "in this regime , schekochihin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the turbulence has the following characteristics : ( a ) the dynamics of the alfvn wave cascade decouple from the compressive slow wave and entropy mode fluctuations and are rigorously described by the equations of reduced mhd @xcite ; ( b ) the slow and entropy mode dynamics is governed by an ion kinetic equation and these modes are passively mixed nonlinearly by the alfvn waves ; and ( c ) no energy is transferred between the alfvnic fluctuations and the compressive fluctuations . since the alfvn wave dynamics are given by reduced mhd , the alfvn waves undergo the same anisotropic cascade described by the theory for strong incompressible mhd turbulence and the cascade continues undamped down to the perpendicular scale of the ion larmor radius @xmath47 .",
    "whether the slow and entropy fluctuations are damped in this regime or merely passive mixed by the alfvn waves with little damping is uncertain at present @xcite .      at the perpendicular scale of the ion larmor radius @xmath48",
    ", two effects come into play .",
    "first , the electromagnetic fluctuations may be damped via the landau resonance with the ions . in the absence of collisions or an external driving mechanism ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : consw ] ) demonstrates that the generalized energy @xmath33 must be conserved during this process . through the wave - particle interaction ,",
    "the electromagnetic fluctuations cause parallel acceleration of the ions , transferring energy from the fields to the ions  the energy lost by the electromagnetic fields is converted into nonthermal structure in velocity space of the ion distribution function .",
    "the second effect is the decoupling of the ion motion from the electromagnetic fluctuations",
    ". an ion samples the electromagnetic field over the scale swept out by its fast larmor motion . for field fluctuations on length scales",
    "smaller than the ion larmor radius @xmath49 , this leads to an averaging over the spatially oscillating field ; the net field experienced by the particle decreases through the ring - averaging over the larmor motion @xcite .",
    "this gradual decoupling of the ions from the fields leads to an inherently nonlinear effect  the entropy cascade .",
    "only recently identified @xcite , the entropy cascade plays a critical role in the inevitable thermalization of the turbulent energy . due to the fact that the radius of the larmor motion for an individual particle depends on the perpendicular kinetic velocity @xmath50 of that particle , particles with high @xmath50 decouple from the field more rapidly than those with low @xmath50 .",
    "the drift velocity of each particle perpendicular to the magnetic field is the @xmath51 velocity ; particles with low perpendicular kinetic velocities @xmath50 feel a stronger ring - averaged electric field @xmath52 than particles with higher @xmath50 , and so drift faster .",
    "this differential @xmath53 drift leads to a coupling of structure in physical space with that in velocity space , resulting in nonlinear phase mixing to smaller scales in both physical and velocity space .",
    "this dual cascade is referred to as the _ entropy cascade _ and occurs for any species @xmath35 at scales @xmath54 . as will be explained in sec  [ sec : thermal ] ,",
    "this inherently nonlinear phenomenon plays a critical role in the thermalization of turbulent energy .",
    "any energy remaining in the electromagnetic fluctuations continues to cascade to scales smaller than the ion larmor radius @xmath56 as a kinetic alfvn wave cascade . for many parameter regimes ,",
    "the damping of the turbulent fluctuations via the landau resonance with the electrons is often substantial for the entire range of scales @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "regardless of the parameter regime , however , by the time the cascade reaches the scale of the electron larmor radius , @xmath58 , the damping always becomes strong enough to terminate the cascade via the landau resonance with the electrons .",
    "again , in the absence of collisions , the generalized energy @xmath33 is conserved and the energy lost by the fields builds nonthermal structure in velocity space of the electron distribution function .      as demonstrated by howes _",
    "@xcite , damping of the electromagnetic fluctuations by the landau resonance does not represent heating of the plasma ; collisions are required to increase the entropy of the system and realize irreversible plasma heating .",
    "the change in entropy @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the plasma volume .",
    "it can be shown that the integral is non - positive , so the entropy always increases .",
    "comparing to equation  ( [ eq : consw ] ) , it is clear that , in the absence of driving , the generalized energy may only decrease due to collisions ; this collision term represents an increase in entropy and thus represents irreversible heating of the plasma .",
    "the action of the collision operator is to smooth out structure in velocity space of the distribution function ; the collision operator is proportional to @xmath62 @xcite where @xmath63 is the pitch angle and @xmath64 is a collisional frequency . for weakly collisional plasmas , therefore , the nonthermal structure in velocity space of @xmath39 ( created through the parallel acceleration of particles by electromagnetic waves via the landau resonance ) must be driven to sufficiently small scales in velocity space such that @xmath65 ; only then can collisions act rapidly enough to diffuse the fine scale structure in velocity space and increase the entropy .",
    "the entropy cascade is therefore the mechanism by which velocity - space structure is driven to very small scales at which point the free energy contained in the nonthermal fluctuations can be thermalized .",
    "this ultimate thermalization of the turbulent energy marks the endpoint of the kinetic cascade .",
    "gyrokinetic theory is only valid for dynamics with characteristic fluctuation frequencies small compared to the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath32 .",
    "since the fluctuation frequency typically increases as the turbulence cascades to smaller scales , it is possible to violate this condition at a scale deep into the kinetic cascade at wavenumbers @xmath55 ; however , collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations can slow this frequency increase along the cascade @xcite . neglecting this",
    "damping provides a conservative estimate of the perpendicular wavenumber threshold at which the cyclotron frequency is reached ; in this case , the frequency can be estimated throughout the kinetic regime by @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the small scale limit of applicability of gyrokinetic theory must be determined on a case by case basis  see howes _",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the limits of validity of gyrokinetics in the solar wind .",
    "astrophysical plasmas in general support an inertial range of many orders or magnitude , so this condition is usually satisfied to wavenumbers beyond the ultimate termination of the kinetic cascade at @xmath67 . taking the specific example of a plasma with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , this low - frequency requirement",
    "is met when @xmath70 ; for a typical astrophysical inertial range of @xmath71 , this gives @xmath72 , so the ion cyclotron frequency is not reached until beyond the scale of @xmath67 ( equal to @xmath73 ) .",
    "next i consider how this picture of the kinetic cascade changes if the cascade is driven at a collisionless scale @xmath74 .",
    "since this work is concerned with inertial range turbulence , it is implicitly assumed that the driving scale is much larger than the kinetic scales , @xmath75 .",
    "based on the fact that the alfvn wave cascade , even in collisionless regimes is governed by fluid equations for all scales @xmath44 , it seems reasonable to expect that the predictions of strong incompressible mhd turbulence would continue to hold : an anisotropic cascade will develop leading to an energy spectrum that scales as @xmath16 and a scale - dependent anisotropy @xmath76 . if the turbulence is driven isotropically at scale @xmath0 , one expects that gyrokinetic approximation will be satisfied for all scales such that @xmath77in other words , the specific predictions for the kinetic cascade outlined here , based on the gyrokinetic theory , will apply beginning at a scale several orders of magnitude below the driving scale .",
    "the efficient numerical study of inertial range turbulence in kinetic plasmas is best conducted using a mixture of computational approaches . at the large , collisional scales ,",
    "a fluid theory is suitable ; a hybrid scheme of fluid electrons and kinetic ions is most efficient at intermediate scales ; at the small scales where the turbulent fluctuations are damped and their energy is converted into heat , a kinetic scheme is required for both species .",

    "velocity - space in the electron distribution function for these same fourier modes ( not shown ) is much smoother , as expected for @xmath125 .",
    "although the results presented here are insufficient to identify clearly the ion entropy cascade , they represent a promising first step .",
    "the development of more sophisticated diagnostics of velocity space  for example , taking spectral transforms in velocity space to yield a velocity - space power spectrum  are necessary to explore more thoroughly the dual cascade of energy to small scales in both physical and velocity space .",
    "as discussed in sec  [ sec : thermal ] , this inherently kinetic and nonlinear mechanism plays a key role in the ultimate conversion of turbulent fluctuation energy into heat .",
    "inertial range turbulence arises across broad range of space , astrophysical , and laboratory environments .",
    "the dissipation of the turbulence generally occurs at scales smaller than the ion mean free path ; therefore , kinetic plasma physics determines the inevitable plasma heating due to the dissipation of the turbulence . in this section",
    ", i will identify a number of systems in which an understanding of the kinetic cascade is necessary to determine the dynamics responsible for the flow of energy and plasma heating .",
    "identification of the characteristic length scales for a specific system  including the driving scale @xmath0 , the ion mean free path @xmath126 , and ion larmor radius @xmath127helps to locate its place within the theoretical framework of the kinetic cascade presented in sec  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the most accessible turbulent astrophysical plasma is the solar wind ; the ability to make _ in situ _ satellite measurements makes this an invaluable environment for the study of the kinetic cascade . measurements of turbulence in the solar wind show a @xmath128 magnetic energy spectrum , interpreted as the beginning of a turbulent inertial range , at scales @xmath129 to @xmath130  cm @xcite .",
    "the solar wind is very weakly collisional , with a mean free path of approximately 1  au , or @xmath131  cm @xcite .",
    "the ion larmor radius in the solar wind is @xmath132 to @xmath133  cm @xcite , yielding @xmath134 and giving an inertial range over five orders of magnitude in scale .",

    "although driven at a collisionless scale @xmath135 , one expects the general picture of the kinetic cascade described here to apply , as discussed in sec  [ sec : other ] .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the collisionality is sufficiently weak in the solar wind that the equilibrium particle distribution functions are observed to deviate significantly from maxwellian@xcite .",
    "therefore , velocity - space anisotropy instabilities , such as the mirror and the firehose , may play a role in the transfer of energy outside the scope of this paper , as suggested by satellite observations @xcite .",
    "interstellar scintillation due to electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of our galaxy demonstrate a power law behavior consistent with an exponent of @xmath128 over twelve orders of magnitude in scale , from @xmath136 to @xmath137  cm @xcite .",

    "the mean free path in the ism is estimated to be @xmath139  cm .",
    "the turbulent ism therefore ideally fits the picture of inertial range turbulence in kinetic plasmas described in this work .    in the accretion disk around a black hole , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite is able to tap the energy of the gravitational potential to drive turbulence ; this turbulence leads to enhanced angular momentum transport , allowing the plasma to accrete onto the black hole .",
    "the mri injects energy into the turbulent cascade on a scale comparable to the scale height of the thick accretion disk , @xmath140  cm @xcite ; this turbulence cascades down to the scale of the ion larmor radius @xmath141  cm . due to the predicted high temperatures and low densities of the accretion disk ,",
    "the mean free path in the plasma is of order the system size , @xmath131  cm .",
    "the radiation emitted from the hot , magnetized plasma depends on the black hole properties and the heating of the plasma species by the kinetic dissipation of the turbulence @xcite . to understand x - ray observational data from chandra",
    ", the thermalization of the turbulent energy by the kinetic cascade must be characterized .",
    "although the gradient - driven turbulence studied in the context of fusion plasmas does not develop an inertial range , energetic ions in a burning fusion plasma  arising either from neutral beam injection or as hot @xmath142-particles generated by the fusion reaction  can drive shear alfvn wave instabilities at scales substantially larger than the ion larmor radius of the thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements have confirmed the generation of shear alfvn modes both by energetic ions @xcite and by thermal ions @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the alfvn modes driven by energetic particles is comparable to the size of present - day experiments , so a discrete few alfvn eigenmodes arise ; for the larger scale plasma of the international tokamak experimental reactor ( iter ) , a broad range of these modes may be driven , possibly leading to the development of a turbulent cascade .",
    "although the primary focus of early studies has been on the confinement of the energetic ions in the presence of these alfvn wave instabilities , the kinetic cascade driven by energetic ions may prove to be an important channel by which energy from the fusion @xmath142-particles is transferred to the kinetic scale of the thermal plasma and converted into heat .",
    "in this paper , i have presented a general picture of a fundamental plasma physics process : the transfer of turbulent energy through an inertial range from the driving scale to dissipative scales followed by the conversion of this energy into heat .",
    "the details of the kinetic cascade of the generalized energy are not yet well understood .",
    "numerical simulations of kinetic turbulence will play a crucial role in illuminating the key elements of the cascade . here",
    "i emphasize several of these important elements :    1 .   the nonlinear cascade of energy in kinetic plasmas preserves a generalized energy given by equation  ( [ eq : consw ] ) .",
    "2 .   collisions are required to increase the entropy and thus achieve irreversible heating of the plasma .",
    "the ultimate thermalization of the turbulent energy is achieved in weakly collisional plasmas through an entropy cascade , a dual cascade of energy to small scales in both physical and velocity space .",
    "i have outlined the numerical approach chosen to investigate turbulence in the transition regime from the alfvn wave to the kinetic alfvn wave cascade .",
    "the computationally demanding simulations use a langevin antenna to model driving from larger scales in the inertial range and a hypercollisional operator to remove energy at the smallest resolved scales .",
    "results from a simulation with high velocity - space resolution are consistent with the development of @xmath50 structure due to the action of the entropy cascade .",
    "inertial range turbulence arises in kinetic plasmas across a broad range of space and astrophysical plasmas  including the solar wind , the interstellar medium , and accretion disks around compact objects  and may play an important role in the thermalization of fusion @xmath142-particle energy in next - generation burning plasmas .    a program of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of kinetic , inertial range turbulence is necessary to explore the key elements of the kinetic cascade described here .",
    "the rich plasma physics involved in the inherently kinetic and nonlinear nature of the predicted entropy cascade , along with the computational intensity of the numerical work , make this important physics problem both fun and challenging .",
    "additional aspects of kinetic turbulence must also be examined , such as the effect of strong fast wave turbulence on the alfvn , slow , and entropy modes ; this requires a treatment beyond the scope of gyrokinetics .",
