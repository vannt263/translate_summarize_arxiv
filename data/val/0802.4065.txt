    "one the most important and intriguing open questions in the physics of compact objects is the issue of the final stage of black hole evolution and the problem of singularities residing in the internal region of the black holes . although the definitive answer to these questions would require the application of the full machinery of the ( unknown as yet ) quantum gravity or even more sophisticated approach , one can still obtain valuable results within the semiclassical framework",
    "of course , the equations of the semiclassical gravity can not be used to describe the evolution of the system completely : such equations are expected to break down in the planck regime . on the other hand , however , having established the domain of applicability of the theory precisely one can obtain interesting and important results . moreover , a careful analysis of the solutions to the semiclassical equations can show us tendencies in the evolution of the system , indicating its possible continuation .    it is well known that the physical content of quantum field theory in spacetimes describing black holes is carried by the renormalized stress - energy tensor ( set ) evaluated in a suitable state  @xcite . treating the renormalized stress - energy tensor as the source term of the semiclassical einstein field equations , one can , in principle , determine the back reaction of the quantized fields upon the spacetime geometry of black holes unless the ( expected ) quantum gravity effects become dominant .",
    "therefore , form the point of view of the semiclassical approach , it is crucial to have at one s disposal a general formula describing functional dependence of the renormalized stress - energy tensor on a wide class of metrics .    in the semi - classical approach",
    "we are confronted with two major problems : construction of the renormalized stress - energy tensor on the one hand , and studying its influence via semi - classical equations on the system on the other .",
    "unfortunately , even such a simplified approach leads to the equations that are still far too complicated to be solved exactly and it is natural that much effort has been concentrated on developing approximate methods , referring to numerical calculations or both .",
    "it seems that for the massive fields , the approximation based on the schwinger - dewitt expansion  @xcite is of required generality .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that for sufficiently massive fields , the renormalized effective action , @xmath0 , can be expanded in powers of @xmath1 it is because the nonlocal contribution to the total effective action can be neglected , and , consequently , there remains only the vacuum polarization part which is local and determined by the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "the stress - energy tensor can , therefore , be obtained by functional differentiation of the effective action with respect to the metric tensor : @xmath2 such a tensor describing the vacuum polarization effects of the quantized massive fields in the vacuum type - d geometries has been constructed and subsequently applied in a series of papers by frolov and zelnikov  @xcite .",
    "they used the schwinger - dewitt method  @xcite and constructed the first order approximation of the effective action , omitting the terms which do not contribute to the final results in the ricci - flat spaces .",
    "these results have subsequently been extended in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where the most general formulas describing the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the massive scalar , spinor and vector fields have been calculated .",
    "as the effective action consists of 10 ( integrated ) purely geometric terms constructed from the curvature tensor and multiplied by the spin - dependent coefficients , it suffices to calculate their functional derivatives with respect to metric tensor only once .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of the scalar , spinor and vector fields can easily be obtained by taking the linear combination of the thus obtained functional derivatives with the spin - dependent coefficients .",
    "interested reader is referred to  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "( especially see eqs .",
    "7 - 18 and table i of ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the range of applicability of such a stress - energy tensor is dictated by the limitations of the validity of the renormalized effective action : it can be used in any spacetime provided the mass of the quantized field is sufficiently great , i.e. , when the compton length , @xmath3 is much smaller than the characteristic radius of curvature , @xmath4 where the latter means any characteristic length scale associated with the geometry in question .",
    "assuming , for example , that @xmath5 is related to the kretschmann scalar as @xmath6 one has a simple criterion for the validity of the schwinger - dewitt expansion .",
    "typically , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the black hole mass , and , therefore , one expects that the approximation would be accurate provided @xmath9 and @xmath5 satisfy @xmath10    using a different method , anderson , hiscock , and samuel @xcite evaluated @xmath11 of the massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling for a general static , spherically symmetric spacetime and applied the obtained formulas to the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) spacetime .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "their approximation is equivalent to the schwinger - dewitt expansion ; to obtain the lowest ( i. e. @xmath12 ) terms , one has to use sixth - order wkb expansion of the mode functions .",
    "numerical calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the schwinger - dewitt method always provide a good approximation of the renormalized stress energy tensor of the massive scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling as long as the mass of the field remains sufficiently large .",
    "the techniques presented in refs .",
    "@xcite have been successfully applied in a number of cases . specifically , the vacuum polarization in the electrically charged black holes have been studied in refs .",

    "@xcite have been applied in the spactimes of the reissner - nordstrm  @xcite and dilaton black holes  @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the back reaction problem have been studied in refs .",
    "especially interesting in this regard are the regular black hole geometries , being the solutions of the coupled system of equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics and gravitation .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of the massive scalar fields ( with an arbitrary curvature coupling ) in such spaces have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the issue of the regular black holes in general relativity has a long and interesting history .",
    "for example , one of the methods that can be used in construction of such configurations consits in replacing the singular black hole interior by a regular core .",
    "this idea appeared in mid sixties  @xcite and its various realizations have been and still are investigated .",
    "for example , in the models considered in refs .",
    "@xcite part of the region inside the event horizon is joined through a thin boundary layer to de sitter geometry .",
    "similar idea has been applied in the calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the singular interior of the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole has been replaced by the bertotti - robinson geometry .",
    "of course , such a geometric surgery does not exhaust all interesting possibilities .",
    "the regular geometries constructed with the aid of suitably chosen profile functions , or , better , the exact solutions constructed for specific , physically reasonable sources are of equal importance  @xcite .",
    "recent interest in the nonlinear electrodynamics is partially motivated ( beside a natural curiosity ) by the fact that the theories of this type frequently arise in modern theoretical physics .",
    "for example , they appear as effective theories of string / m - theory .",
    "moreover , on general grounds one expects that it should be possible to construct the regular black hole solutions to the coupled system of equations of the nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity .",
    "one of the most interesting and intriguing regular solutions has been constructed by ayn - beato and garca @xcite .",
    "it has subsequently been reinterpreted by bronnikov in refs .",
    "the former solution describes a regular static and spherically symmetric configuration parametrized by the mass and the electric charge whereas the latter describes a formally similar geometry characterized by @xmath13 and the magnetic charge @xmath14 .",
    "we shall refer to the solutions of this kind as abgb geometries .",
    "it should be noted that the electric solution does not contradict the no - go theorem , which states that if the lagrangian of the matter fields , @xmath15 is an arbitrary function of @xmath16 with the maxwell asymptotics in a weak field limit ( @xmath17 is the electromagnetic tensor ) , then it can not have a regular center .",
    "this is because the formulation of the nonlinear electrodynamics employed by ayn - beato and garca ( @xmath18 framework in the nomenclature of refs .",
    "@xcite ) is not the one to which one refers in the assumptions of the theorem .",
    "specifically , the solution of ayn - beato and garca has been constructed in a formulation of the nonlinear electrodynamics obtained from the original one ( @xmath19 framework ) by means of a legendre transformation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    for certain values of the parameters the abgb line element describes a black hole and",
    "an attractive feature of this solutions that simplifies calculations is the possibility to express the location of the horizons in terms of the lambert special functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the function @xmath20 coincides with the lagrangian density of the maxwell theory in the weak field limit , one expects that at large distances the static and spherically symmetric solution should approach the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "a similar behavior should occur outside the event horizon for @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes either the electric or magnetic charge and @xmath13 is the mass .",
    "the objective of this paper is to construct the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized neutral massive spinor and vector fields in the spacetime of the regular abgb black hole .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of the scalar fields with arbitrary curvature coupling has been constructed and discussed in refs .",
    "the results presented here are the basic ingredients of the first - order back reaction calculations .",
    "they can also be used in the analysis of the various energy conditions and quantum inequalities .",
    "the source term of the semi - classical einstein field equations is given by the stress - energy tensor .",
    "ideally , such a tensor should be constructed from the renormalized effective action , @xmath23 in a standard way , i.e. , by functional differentiation of @xmath23 with respect to the metric . unfortunately , neither the exact nor the approximate form of @xmath24 is known in general . however , in a large mass limit of the quantized fields one can construct its local approximation satisfactorily describing the vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the massive scalar , spinor and vector fields in curved spacetime satisfy the differential equations @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath28 is the curvature coupling constant , and @xmath29 are the dirac matrices obeying standard relations @xmath30 the lowest - order approximation of the renormalized effective action , @xmath31 of the quantized massive fields satisfying equations ( [ s0]-[s1 ] ) is given by a remarkably simple expression @xmath32 \\\\",

    "making use of elementary properties of the dirac matrices and the riemann tensor , after simple calculations , one obtains the first term of the asymptotic expansion of the effective action in the form @xcite @xmath37 where the numerical coefficients @xmath38 depending on the spin of the field are given in a table i.    up to now , we have not specified the quantum state of the field .",
    "however , the construction of the effective action has been carried out with the assumption that the state in question may be identified with the hartle - hawking state . a closer examination of the problem indicates that outside the narrow strip in the closest vicinity of the event horizon , the results obtained in the hartle - hawking as well as the unruh and the boulware states are almost indistinguishable as they differ by the contributions of the real particles . on the other hand , inside that region the stress - energy tensor strongly depends on the chosen state and may diverge at the event horizon .",
    "on general grounds , one expects that for regular geometries the schwinger - dewitt approximation yields a regular stress - energy tensor at the event horizon .",
    "it should be stressed that although the effective action @xmath39 can , in principle , be calculated for any line element , its physical applications are limited to the quantized fields in the large mass limit .",
    "moreover , the technical difficulties one may encounter in the process of calculation may prevent direct application of the effective action and the stress - energy tensor .",
    "finally , observe that the effective action approach employed in this paper requires the metric of the spacetime to be positively defined .",
    "hence , to obtain the physical stress - energy tensor one has to analitically continue the results constructed for the euclidean metric .    .the",

    "an interesting solution to the coupled system of nonlinear electrodynamics and gravity representing a class of the black holes parametrized by a mass and a charge has been constructed recently by ayn - beato and garca  @xcite and by bronnikov @xcite .",
    "the former describes electrically charged configuration in the @xmath18-framework whereas the latter describes geometry of the magnetically charged solution in the @xmath19-framework .",
    "both line elements are formally identical and can be written in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 ,   \\label{gg}\\ ] ] @xmath8 is the black hole mass and @xmath22 is either the magnetic or the electric charge . for small values of the charge",
    "it differs outside the event horizon from the reissner - nordstrm solution by terms of order @xmath43 similarly , at large distances the the function @xmath44 also closely resembles that of the rn solution . indeed , expanding metric potentials in a power series one",
    "concludes that the abgb solution behaves asymptotically as @xmath45    on the other hand , and this is even more interesting and has profound consequences , the interior of the abgb solution is regular .",
    "this can be demonstrated by studying behavior of various curvature invariants .",
    "it can be shown that curvature invariants factorize in such a way that there is a common multiplicative factor , which for @xmath46 behaves asymptotically as @xmath47 for @xmath48 the abgb solution reduces to the schwarzschild line element and it is the nonlinear charge , no matter how small , that leads to the dramatic changes of the geometry .",
    "the spacetime described by the line element ( [ line_abg ] ) with ( [ gg ] ) has been extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that although the metric coefficient @xmath44 is a complicated function of @xmath49 , the location of the horizons may be elegantly expressed in terms of the lambert functions @xcite .",
    "since these results are , apparently , not widely known we shall summarize a few basic facts . for a short description of the lambert functions the reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "making use of the substitution @xmath50 and @xmath51 and subsequently introducing a new unknown function @xmath52 by means of the relation @xmath53 one arrives at @xmath54 since the lambert function is defined as @xmath55 one concludes that the location of the horizons as a function of @xmath56 is given by the real branches of the lambert functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the only real branches of the lambert function with the branch point at @xmath61 where e is the base of natural logarithms",
    ". finally , observe , that simple manipulations of eqs .",
    "( [ eh ] ) and ( [ ih ] ) indicate that for @xmath62 the horizons @xmath63 and @xmath64 merge at @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a principal branch of the lambert function @xmath68    inspection of ( [ qextr ] ) reveals another interesting feature of the abgb geometries : the black hole solution exists for @xmath69 greater than the analogous ratio of the parameters of the rn solution .",
    "the three types of the abgb solutions therefore are : the regular black hole with the inner and event horizons for @xmath70 the extremal black hole for @xmath71 and the regular configuration for @xmath72 as have been observed earlier at large distances as well as for small charges the geometry of the abgb solution resembles that of the reissner - nordstrm .",
    "there is , however , one notable distinction : for @xmath73 the reissner - nordstrm solution describes unphysical naked singularity whereas the regular geometry for @xmath74 could be interpreted as a particle like solution .",
    "the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar ( with an arbitrary curvature coupling ) , spinor and vector fields in a large mass limit has a general form @xmath75 where @xmath76 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eff_act_2 ] ) and the spin dependent coefficients are listed in table i. the purely geometric objects @xmath77 have been calculated in refs .",
    "it has been shown that the thus obtained renormalized stress - energy tensor consists of approximately 100 terms ( constructed from the riemann tensor , its covariant derivatives and contractions ) combined with the numerical coefficients depending on the spin of the quantized field .",
    "however , such a local geometric structure of the stress - energy tensor has its price : @xmath78 does not describe the process of particle creation which is a nonlocal phenomenon .",
    "fortunately , for sufficiently massive fields , the contribution of the real particles can be neglected and the schwinger - dewitt action satisfactorily approximates the total effective action .",
    "the general expression describing the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized fields in a large mass limit is rather complicated and to avoid unnecessary proliferation of lengthy formulas it will be not presented here . for its full form as well as the technical details the interested reader",
    "is referred to @xcite ( especially see eqs.7 - 18 ) and  @xcite . because of numerous identities that hold for the riemann tensor , the final form of the stress - energy tensor is not unique and obviously depends on adapted simplification strategies",
    ". it should be noted , however , that any other calculation based on the effective action ( [ eff_act_2 ] ) with the numerical coefficients @xmath79 for scalar , spinor and vector field must yield results identical to those of refs .",

    "the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar field with the arbitrary curvature coupling in the abgb geometry has been calculated and exhaustively discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we shall extend these calculations to the massive spinor and vector fields .",
    "since the general form of the stress - energy tensor is rather complicated , one expects that its components evaluated for the specific line element are , except simple geometries , formidable .",
    "our calculations in the abgb background clearly shows that this is indeed the case , and once again , to avoid unnecessary proliferation of long formulas we shall not display them here . on the other hand , one can obtain a great deal of information studying the behaviour of the components of the stress - energy tensor in some physically important regimes .",
    "below we shall consider expansions of the stress - energy tensor for small @xmath80 large @xmath81 and study the configuration near and at the extremality limit .",
    "special attention will be put on the regularity issues and the interior of the extreme abgb black hole .",
    "each component of @xmath82 in the abgb spacetime has a general form @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are numerical coefficients depending on the spin of the field . for simplicity ,",
    "we have omitted tensor indices in right hand side of the above equation .",
    "this result can be contrasted with the analogous expression obtained for the reissner - nordstrm black hole @xmath88 where @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , as before , the numerical coefficients depending on @xmath92 in both cases the stress - energy tensor is covariantly conserved and falls as @xmath93as @xmath94 the latter behavior indicates that there is no need to impose spherical boxes in the back reaction calculations .",
    "moreover , both tensors are regular at the event horizon .",
    "since the lagrangian density of the classical ( nonlinear ) field considered in this paper tends to its maxwell analogue as @xmath95 one expects that in this limit , regardless of the spin of the quantized field , the leading behavior of the renormalized stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive fields is similar to the analogous terms constructed in the reissner - nordstrm geometry . on the other hand , for the configurations near the extremality limit the differences between the tensors outside the event horizon should be more prominent .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the difference between the radial and time components of the stress - energy tensor factorizes : @xmath96 f\\left ( x\\right ) ,   \\label{factorize}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a regular function .",
    "now , let us consider a freely falling frame .",
    "a simple calculation shows that  the frame components of the tensor @xmath98 are @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the energy per unit mass along the geodesic .",
    "one concludes , therefore , that since all components of @xmath103 are regular and  @xmath104 is by ( [ factorize ] ) finite , the stress - energy tensor of the quantize massive fields is regular in freely falling frame .",
    "let us postpone the detailed analysis of the stress - energy tensor in the abgb spacetime for a while and consider a far more simple case of the @xmath106 geometry .",
    "such geometries are closely related to the extremal black holes .",
    "indeed , @xmath106 can be obtained by expanding the geometry of the vicinity of the event horizon into a whole manifold .",
    "various aspects of the geometries of this type have been discussed , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "the extremal abgb black hole is described by a line element ( [ line_abg ] ) with @xmath107 .\\ ] ] now , in order to investigate the geometry in the vicinity of the event horizon , @xmath108 and to obtain uniform approximation we introduce new coordinates @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 expanding the function @xmath44 in powers of @xmath112 retaining quadratic terms and subsequently taking the limit @xmath113 we obtain @xmath114 since @xmath115 the line element does not belong to the bertotti - robinson class , contrary to the near - horizon geometry of the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "alternatively , this can easily be demonstrated making use of the relation @xmath116 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate , as the stress - energy tensor of the nonlinear electromagnetic field , @xmath117 has nonvanishing trace at the event horizon .",

    ", the stress - energy tensor is expected to satisfy some restrictions usually addressed to as the energy conditions .",
    "their detailed studies are worthwhile as the violation of the energy conditions frequently leads to exotic , yet physically interesting situations . of course , the main role played by the renormalized stress - energy tensor is to serve as the source term of the semi - classical einstein field equations . for the problem on hand",

    "it should be noted , however , that the regularity of the source term does not necessarily leads to the regularity of the quantum corrected geometry .",
    "indeed , the latter requires that various curvature invariants of the self - consistent solution of the semi - classical equations with the total source term given by the sum of classical stress - energy tensor of the nonlinear electrodynamics and of the quantized massive fields be regular .",
    "however , since the resulting semi - classical equations comprise a very complicated system of sixth - order differential equations , there are no simple way to construct the appropriate solutions .",

    "the energy density of the massive vector field is positive for @xmath225 and negative otherwise . for @xmath226",

    "all the components display oscillatory behavior for @xmath245 indicating that the back reaction effects would be especially interesting there .",
    "such a behavior can easily be understood in relation with the behavior of the line element .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath49 the line element closely resembles that of a flat spacetime , and , consequently , the vacuum polarization effects are small . on the other hand , for @xmath246 the function @xmath44 changes noticeably leading to the changes of the stress - energy tensor .",

    "specifically , it has been shown that the stress - energy tensor of the massive fields is regular inside the degenerate event horizon .",
    "this result raises important question of the nature of the black hole interior in the back - reaction problem .",
    "preliminary calculations carried out in  @xcite for the quadratic gravity , which , for certain calculational purposes , may be considered as some sort of a toy model of the semi - classical theory , indicate that at least for the first - order calculations it is possible to obtain regular solution , at the expense of a small modification of the classical nonlinear action . of course , the stress - energy tensor of the quantized massive fields constructed in the general static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime is far more complicated than quadratic terms  @xcite , however , the general pattern that lies behind the calculations should be , in general , the same .",
