    "it is well known that qcd , of the real world , can not be studied through the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "after all , qcd is not a conformal field theory , @xmath3 is not large , the string dual of qcd is a complete mystery , and if there is such a dual , the string scale must be low .",
    "one can even make more practical objections , such as that any low energy predictions which do come out can not be original",
    ". they must be the same as the predictions of chiral perturbation theory , since the symmetries are the same . or at least , since ads / cft employs the operator product expansion , it should not be more powerful than qcd sum rules , which should be able to extract as much information as possible out of the ope .",
    "therefore , why bother with ads / qcd at all ?",
    "we are motivated by several reasons .",
    "first , with qcd we have experimental results which can help determine the elements of ads / cft essential for establishing a predictive duality .",
    "second , after we know what works and what does not , there is the possibility that we may learn something about qcd itself , and perhaps about strongly coupled gauge theories in more generality .",
    "finally , as our framework depends on the holographic map , we are also indirectly exploring this map experimentally .    to elaborate on these motivations ,",
    "we turn to the topic of the current work : tensor mesons . we will focus on the @xmath1 , a spin - two isospin singlet meson with mass 1275 mev , although higher spin mesons will be discussed as well . as we will shortly see ( section [ seccpt ] ) ,",
    "not much can be said about tensor mesons in perturbation theory .",
    "even if we couple the @xmath1 universally , assuming general coordinate invariance ( gc ) , there is an unknown dimensional coupling constant , the analog of the planck scale for the spin-2 graviton .",
    "the decay rates to pions and to kaons can be related by @xmath9 , but the decay rate to photons has a free nda factor of order 1 .",
    "the @xmath1 mass is another free parameter . what s worse is that the cutoff on the chiral lagrangian is @xmath10 mev , which is below the @xmath1 mass .",
    "so even if chiral symmetry did make predictions , we would not be able to trust them .",
    "in contrast , on the ads side , the @xmath1 will be treated as a spin-2 gauge field in the bulk ( section  [ secads ] ) .",
    "equivalently , we can think of it as a kk excitation of the graviton .",
    "thus , we secure its interactions by gc . but now the coupling constant can be calculated by matching to the perturbative ope .",
    "the @xmath1 mass is set by the eigenvalue equation for the kk mode .",
    "we define our units by fixing the ir cutoff with the @xmath11 mass .",
    "this leads to the simple formula that the ratio of the @xmath1 mass to the @xmath11 mass is simply given by the ration of the zeros of bessel functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath14 the experimental value for this ratio is 1.64 , a difference of 3% .",
    "remarkably , mass predictions can be extended up the regge trajectory for higher spin mesons , without a noticeable loss of accuracy ( section  [ sechigher ] ) .",
    "the coupling to photons is also fixed in this theory  it is determined by the overlap of the flat photon wavefunction with that of the @xmath1 .",
    "thus we can compute @xmath15 the observed width is @xmath16 kev , so we get this rate correct to within experimental error .",
    "these two calculations indicate that , for some reason , ads / qcd is more accurate then we have any right to expect . because the decay to photons is sensitive to the admixture of the tensor glueball operator , we actually obtain some non - trivial information about the @xmath1 from the this calculation .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ secfgg ] .",
    "not everything in the tensor sector works so well .",
    "we also calculate the rate for @xmath1 decaying to pions , still without introducing any new free parameters , and find it too small by a factor of 4 .",
    "this is more in line with our naive expectations .",
    "it indicates that either some of our assumptions , such as the those about boundary conditions , should be reconsidered , or that higher dimension operators are relevant .",
    "in fact , we know roughly where the string scale is on the ads side .",
    "some of the tensor modes , such as @xmath17 , must be string states , because they carry isospin .",
    "so we are at least very near the regime where string corrections become important .",
    "gravity corrections are also important because we know the effective planck scale for the @xmath1 , and it is also low .",
    "so it is not surprising that our calculations can receive stringy corrections . in section [ secho ]",
    "we show that higher dimension bulk operators are very relevant to the @xmath1 to pion decays .",
    "more importantly , we also show that higher dimension bulk operators are _ not _ relevant for the decay to photons , so we have more reason to trust our @xmath18 calculation .",
    "before we describe the ads / qcd construction , we review and elaborate on what is known about the @xmath1 from other methods . in particular , we discuss chiral perturbation theory , which allows us to couple the @xmath1 to pions",
    ". we will also establish notation and present some formulae which will be used later on .      in chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "the pions are goldstone bosons for a spontaneously broken @xmath19 global symmetry  @xcite .",
    "they are embedded in a matrix @xmath20 which is exponentiated to get @xmath21 this matrix @xmath22 transforms under @xmath23 @xmath24 and the non - linear transformations of the pions follow . the lowest order chiral lagrangian ( with massless quarks ) is @xmath25 = \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\pi^a ) ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\pi^a )    + \\cdots\\ ] ] to next order",
    ", there are additional terms  @xcite @xmath26 ^ 2 + l_2    \\mathrm{tr } [ d_{\\mu } u^{\\dag } d_{\\nu } u ] \\mathrm{tr } [ d^{\\mu } u^{\\dag }    d^{\\nu } u ] + l_3 \\mathrm{tr } [ d_{\\mu } u^{\\dag } d^{\\mu } u d_{\\nu } u^{\\dag }    d^{\\nu } u ] \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath27 + l_{10 } \\mathrm{tr } [ u^{\\dag } f_r^{\\mu \\nu } u    f^l_{\\mu \\nu } ] \\ ] ] where @xmath28 are the field strengths for external right- and left - handed gauge fields . at this point , all the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are unknown parameters to be fit to data .",
    "often , assumptions additional to chiral symmetry can predict some of these @xmath31 s .",
    "for example , vector meson dominance assumes that the bare @xmath31 are all zero , and the observed @xmath31 come from integrating out heavy mesons , in particular the @xmath11 meson  @xcite .",
    "this predicts some relations between the @xmath31 .",
    "another example is ads / qcd which predicts similar , but different , relations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 are fairly well known , and are therefore handy for distinguishing different theories .    to add the @xmath1 , we introduce , by hand , a massive spin-2 meson",
    ". its kinetic term should be of the fierz - pauli form  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "then the most general set of interactions with the chiral lagrangian begins @xmath34 + c_2 h \\mathrm{tr } [ d_{\\mu } u d_{\\mu } u^{\\dag } ] + c_3    h_{\\mu \\nu } \\mathrm{tr } [ u^{\\dag } f^r_{\\mu \\alpha } u f^l_{\\alpha \\nu } ] +    \\cdots \\label{linth}\\ ] ] by chiral symmetry alone , the @xmath35 , like the @xmath31 , are completely undetermined .    to progress , we can assume that the @xmath1 couples universally to the energy momentum tensor for matter , like in general relativity . and , like in general relativity",
    ", this would let us bootstrap the @xmath1 s self - couplings as well , at least in the absence of an @xmath1 mass .",
    "but because of the mass , the final lagrangian will have no exact symmetry lacking in the general expression  .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption that the @xmath1 couples to the energy momentum tensor of matter is consistent within effective field theory , as it parametrically raises the scale at which the @xmath1 interactions become strong  @xcite .",
    "adding an @xmath1 coupling strength @xmath36",
    "( if @xmath1 were a graviton , @xmath37 ) to the lagrangian , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy momentum tensor following from @xmath40 @xmath41\\ ] ] this is of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43",
    ". we can integrate out the @xmath1 now , recalling that because of the fierz - pauli mass its propagator is  @xcite @xmath44 where the projector , in the particle s rest frame , has the form @xmath45 ( in the massless case , or if the mass had just the @xmath46 term , the residue would have a @xmath47 instead of a @xmath48 ) .",
    "then integrating out the @xmath1 gives an @xmath49 term with coefficients @xmath50 of course , these are not predictions , as the @xmath31 can have contributions from integrating out other fields as well , or simply from adding a bare term .",
    "we will find in the next paragraph , that from the @xmath1 decay rate into pions we can set @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these are fairly substantial contributions to the experimental values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "of course , this tells us nothing about the @xmath1 , as we must make assumptions about what else contributes to the @xmath31 , which are just as likely to be wrong as our universality hypothesis for the @xmath1 couplings .",
    "now let us turn to this the @xmath1 decays .",
    "the @xmath1 decays predominantly into pions .",
    "the minimal couplings can be written as @xmath56 then the decay rate is  @xcite @xmath57 where we have used @xmath58 mev and @xmath59 mev .",
    "we are also interested in the decay into photons , which is well measured also .",
    "if we define the coupling as @xmath60 then the formula for this decay rate is  @xcite @xmath61 the observed decay rates are @xmath62 156 mev and @xmath63 2.6 kev which imply @xmath64 mev@xmath65 and @xmath66 mev@xmath65 . a helpful way to compare theory and",
    "experiment is through the ratio of decay rates with the phase space factored out @xmath67 assuming strict universality of the @xmath1 couplings would lead to @xmath68 , and get this ratio wrong by six orders of magnitude .    to get a better prediction",
    ", we must use the fact that the photon is really external to qcd , and so its coupling must be suppressed by powers of the weak coupling constant @xmath69 .",
    "naive dimensional analysis  @xcite instructs us to take @xmath70 , for some constant @xmath71 of order one .",
    "then @xmath72 this is a fairly good estimate .",
    "we see that @xmath73 .",
    "but we can not get @xmath71 by nda or by assuming universality of the @xmath1 couplings ( which would say @xmath74 ) .",
    "one way to estimate @xmath71 has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "similar to the assumption in vector meson dominance , it declares that the decay to photons is mediated purely by @xmath11 exchange .",
    "that is , @xmath75 decays into two @xmath11 s which decay into photons .",
    "so the bare coupling @xmath76 is zero .",
    "this assumption can be called tensor meson dominance ( tmd )  @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath77 from experiment , it gives @xmath78 this is not better than naive dimensional analysis with @xmath79 .",
    "tensor meson dominance also relates the @xmath1 decay constant @xmath80 to @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath1 decay constant is defined by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the polarization tensor for the @xmath1 and @xmath83 is the energy momentum tensor .",
    "we have chosen @xmath80 to be dimensionless , and so it is off by factors of @xmath84 from what is often called @xmath85 in the literature .",
    "if we assume , via tmd , that the pion tensor form factors are determined by @xmath1 exchange , even as @xmath86 , then the normalization of the pion s energy determines @xmath87 we can not compare @xmath80 to experiment , but we will compare this value to predictions from ads / qcd below .    in summary , we wrote down the most general lagrangian involving a spin-2 field , the @xmath1 , which respects chiral symmetry .",
    "we assumed the @xmath1 couples to the energy momentum tensor of the various matter fields , like the graviton , even though the @xmath1 is massive .",
    "its mass , its coupling constant , and an order one factor in its coupling to photons are all free parameters .",
    "we can fit these to the observed mass , decay rate to pions , and decay rate to photons , but then there are no predictions .",
    "instead , we can assume tensor meson dominance _ ad hoc _ , which eliminates one parameter , and makes a prediction which turns out not to much better than naive dimensional analysis .",
    "now we turn to the predictions from ads / qcd . we will mostly follow the notation of @xcite , although @xcite presents an equivalent formulation .",
    "our review will be quick , and we refer the reader to these two papers , or to the original ads / cft literature  @xcite for more details .",
    "the basic premise of ads / cft is that there is a duality between a 4d conformal field theory and a 5d gravity theory on a curved ads background .",
    "position in the extra dimension corresponds to energy in the 4d theory .",
    "we will use conformal coordinates , with the curvature scale normalized to 1 , so the metric is @xmath88 energy independence in the cft corresponds to an ads isometry which shifts @xmath89 .",
    "small @xmath89 is the high energy uv region , and large @xmath89 is the ir . though approximately conformal in the uv ( in the sense that @xmath90 ) , qcd becomes strongly coupled , and breaks conformality in ir .",
    "we avoid this awkward region by explicitly cutting off the space at @xmath91 , where @xmath92 ( which will be of order @xmath93 ) is to be fit to data .",
    "we thus implicitly assume that asymptotic freedom sets in very quickly as we go the uv in qcd , motivating our choice of the ads metric .",
    "operators in the cft , or in this case qcd , correspond to fields in the ads bulk .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 , which is a isospin triplet spin-1 meson in qcd , corresponds to a bulk gauge field @xmath94 in bulk .",
    "the action for @xmath94 is just @xmath95 more precisely , @xmath11 is the first kk excitation of the 4-vector part @xmath96 , while the other kk modes , @xmath97 , correspond to heavier resonances with the same quantum numbers .",
    "thus the @xmath97 are 4d fields with 5d profiles determined by the vector kk equation in ads @xmath98 the generic solution is @xmath99 \\right.\\ ] ] we then impose boundary conditions @xmath100 , which sets @xmath101 and quantizes the masses to be solutions of @xmath102 .",
    "the normalization is set by @xmath103 and so the @xmath11 wavefunction is @xmath104 we can then use the observed @xmath11 mass of 775 mev to fix @xmath105 .    for the @xmath1",
    ", we need a spin-2 field in the bulk , @xmath106 .",
    "the first kk mode of @xmath106 will be the @xmath1 .",
    "of course , we already have a spin-2 field in the bulk , the graviton .",
    "expanding linearized gravity excitations about the ads background @xmath107 produces a lagrangian @xmath108 \\label{haction}\\ ] ] but since we are not demanding a fully consistent theory , we could just as well have introduced a different spin-2 field .",
    "in fact , we expect from qcd that there are a number of isospin singlet spin-2 particles , including glueballs , and so a complete formulation should include a number of bulk spin-2 fields .",
    "each field will have a tower of kk modes , whose profiles are determined by the tensor equation of motion @xmath109 the generic solution is @xmath110 \\right.\\ ] ] boundary conditions @xmath111 again put @xmath101 and now quantize the masses according to @xmath112 . for the spin-2 case ,",
    "the normalization is set by @xmath113 .",
    "thus the @xmath1 profile is @xmath114 thus we get our first prediction .",
    "the @xmath1 mass is predicted to be 3.83 @xmath115 1236 mev , which , as noted in the introduction is , only @xmath116 off of the observed mass of 1275 mev .",
    "in other words , we have made the @xmath92 independent prediction @xmath117 of equation  .",
    "the experimental central values give @xmath118    to be fair , we have been working in the free field approximation , so that , at this point , the @xmath1 and @xmath11 are infinitely narrow resonances .",
    "in fact , the widths of the @xmath1 and @xmath11 are @xmath119 mev and @xmath120 mev respectively , and thus there is an uncertainty in what we should expect the resonance mass to be .",
    "so the ads / cft prediction is entirely satisfactory .",
    "it is remarkable how little we had to introduce to arrive at this prediction  no chiral symmetry breaking , no mention of the number of flavors or colors , in fact , no matching to qcd at all .",
    "we simply assumed that the lightest spin-2 mode is captured by a 5d massless spin-2 field ( i.e. the dual of a spin-2 operator of the lowest dimension ) .",
    "next , we will calculate the coupling constant of the @xmath1 by matching to the operator product expansion for the tensor - tensor two point function in qcd .",
    "we prefer to express all the dimensionful scales in terms of @xmath92 , so we write the coupling constant as @xmath121 , leaving @xmath85 as the dimensionless coupling constant associated with the @xmath1 , directly analogous to @xmath122 for the @xmath11 .",
    "for each quark , we can construct a tensor bilinear , @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "this is just the energy momentum tensor for quarks in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the ope we need is the @xmath125 two - point function , which can be written as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the transverse projector .",
    "the constant term in the @xmath125 ope comes from a 1-loop quark diagram  @xcite @xmath128    since we have the correlator as a function of momentum @xmath129 for fixed cutoff @xmath130 , on the 5d side , we should think of the current as a source on the uv boundary at @xmath131 , @xmath132 then the @xmath125 correlator can be derived from an effective 4d action at @xmath131 , with the fifth dimension integrated out : @xmath133 the easiest way to compute this is through the bulk - to - boundary propagators @xmath134 , which propagates a source via @xmath135 .",
    "then the action reduces to a boundary term on the equations of motion , and we have simply @xmath136 for the purpose of evaluating @xmath85 , the ir boundary conditions are irrelevant and taking @xmath137 we solve for @xmath134 directly .",
    "the solution involves the second order bessel function @xmath138  @xcite @xmath139 it is not hard to check that this satisfies @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "thus the ads prediction for the leading log in the tensor - tensor correlator is @xmath142 the right hand side of this equation presents the leading log in the small @xmath89 expansion of @xmath143 .",
    "once we identify the quark content of the @xmath1 , we can match the logs in and to fix @xmath85 .    to identify the @xmath1 note that there is more than one isospin singlet state we can construct in qcd .",
    "first , there are the quark states .",
    "but in addition , in qcd there is a tensor glueball state .",
    "its energy momentum tensor is @xmath144 conveniently , the two - point function for the glueball is qcd has also been studied .",
    "its ope begins  @xcite @xmath145 now , in general , there will be kinetic mixing among the glueball and the quark states , proportional to @xmath146 .",
    "although , the explicit mixing is known , we will be content to observe that one of the eigenstates should couple to the conserved current , the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this will be the lightest state , as the @xmath146 corrections can only lift the mass , so we identify it as the @xmath1 .",
    "thus we are led to take the @xmath1 coupling to be @xmath147 hence , from qcd , @xmath148 taking @xmath149 and matching produces to @xmath150 and using @xmath151 mev , determined from the @xmath11 mass , the @xmath1 coupling constant is @xmath152 this coupling can not be directly measured , but it lets us calculate the @xmath1 decay rates .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the @xmath1 decay constant @xmath80 as well , defined in .",
    "@xmath80 also appears in residue of the decomposition of the two point function @xmath125 into meson resonances .",
    "@xmath153 on the ads side , the easiest way to compute the residue is by observing that the dirichlet green s function has a similar decomposition over kk modes @xmath154 this green s function is related to the bulk - to - boundary propagator by @xmath155 and so using we can relate the decay constant directly to the wavefunction . for the @xmath1 , with wavefunction",
    ", we get @xmath156 this also can not be measured , but we can compare it to the prediction from tmd ( @xmath157 ) . we will discuss the significance of this discrepancy after calculating the decay rates .",
    "we now discuss how to introduce the photon and calculate @xmath158 .",
    "the photon is a vector field which is external to qcd .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider it as a bulk gauge field , whose zero mode , the photon , is massless .",
    "thus the photon will have a flat profile in the bulk @xmath159 generally , a flat mode in ads is not normalizable .",
    "in fact , regulating with a uv cutoff at @xmath131 @xmath160 normally , this would be a serious problem , as this divergent normalization appears as the coefficient of the photon kinetic term in the 4d action when the extra dimension is integrated out @xmath161 however , the coefficient of the term is supposed to be @xmath162 , and the electric charge is divergent  it has a landau pole .",
    "explicitly , including only the quark contributions @xmath163 but this means that if we set @xmath164 ( for @xmath165 ) then the photon kinetic term becomes canonically normalized , @xmath166 .",
    "we can use this divergent @xmath167 in calculations by just taking the renormalized value for the electric charge at the relevant energy scale .",
    "it is satisfying that in contrast to chiral perturbation theory , where the electric charge must be added by hand , including an order one uncertainty , here the electric charge appears naturally from matching to qed .",
    "another way to model the photon is as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of @xmath168 .",
    "its coupling can then be fit from the ads / cft matching to the two - point function of vector currents in qcd .",
    "since the relevant diagram is the same as the one - loop contribution as in the qed @xmath169-function , it leads to the same value for @xmath170 .",
    "although the two ways of modeling the photon are equivalent , they have complimentary advantages .",
    "the former nicely demonstrates that the @xmath89-dependence of the photon profile corresponds to its running coupling , while the latter shows that it is really only the quark contributions which we must include .",
    "for example , we do not include the electron contribution to @xmath170 because the electron is not part of our ads / qcd model .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath1 to the photon is determined by general coordinate invariance . using the parametrization , we get @xmath171 where @xmath172 is given in and the coupling constant is determined by the overlap integral @xmath173 if we use the value of @xmath36 , calculated in the previous subsection by matching to qcd ( including the 3 quark and gluon contributions ) , this leads to @xmath174 mev@xmath65 and a decay rate of @xmath175 compared to the experimental rate of @xmath176 this is quite remarkable .",
    "all we needed to get this rate was @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the @xmath11 mass to define mev .",
    "in fact , we do not even need the @xmath11 at all . if we take @xmath92 from the measured @xmath1 mass , @xmath177 mev , then @xmath178 kev , which is also within experimental error .    at this point , since we have achieved a very favorable comparison to experiment , it is useful to return to some of our assumptions . recall that we we identified the @xmath1 with the energy - momentum tensor , because it is lightest spin-2 field in the theory .",
    "thus , in our model , the @xmath1 is part glueball , and equal parts up , down , and strange .",
    "if fact , some quark models suggest that the @xmath1 and its nonet partner , the @xmath179 , are close to ideally mixed . that is , the @xmath1 is mostly up and down , and the @xmath180 is almost pure strange .",
    "we have not attempted to include quark masses at this point , so we can not split the @xmath1 from the @xmath180 , but we can nevertheless compare our result to the results of making other assumptions about the @xmath1 quark content . for example , if we decouple the strange , so the @xmath1 is up , down and glue , we would get @xmath181 kev .",
    "it is reassuring that the 3 quark value ( @xmath182  kev ) and the 2 quark value ( @xmath183  kev ) straddle the experimental decay rate  ( @xmath176  kev ) . if we had not included the glueball component , by ignoring the last term in eq .",
    ", the decay rates would be @xmath184  kev and @xmath185  kev for the 3 quark and 2 quark cases respectively .",
    "this lets us conclude that the @xmath1 must have a large glueball component , consistent with a universal coupling to the energy momentum tensor .",
    "thus far , we have derived two predictions  the @xmath1 mass and the partial width @xmath187  and the only input from experiment ( besides @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) was the @xmath11 mass , which just set the scale . to work out the rate @xmath186 we need more information .",
    "we need to model chiral symmetry breaking , including both the quark condensate and quark masses .",
    "needless to say , the construction we will use is not unique , and ambiguities make these predictions less accurate , and less convincing . since this is not the main focus of this paper , we will quickly review , and then simply use , the formalism suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the global symmetries @xmath188 of qcd map to gauge symmetries in the ads .",
    "so we introduce bulk gauge bosons @xmath189 and @xmath190 for the two subgroups . in 4d , pions appear as the goldstone bosons when the global chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken . since in 5d",
    "the global symmetry is gauged , the goldstone bosons are eaten and show up in unitary gauge as a mass term @xmath191 for the axial vector boson @xmath192 . in the 4d description of the 5d higgs mechanism , the vectors @xmath193 eat the scalar @xmath194 components .",
    "so in order to have massless 4d pions , we must arrange for @xmath194 to have a massless excitation .",
    "the mass @xmath195 corresponds to the formation of vacuum condensates , such as @xmath196 in qcd .",
    "thus we should think of @xmath195 as being spontaneously generated by the expectation value of some bulk scalar field @xmath197 .",
    "since this breaking occurs in the ir , the mass should be localized near the ir brane .",
    "however , it should have some @xmath89 dependence corresponding to the energy dependence of the operator @xmath196 .",
    "ads / cft tells us to match the dimension of the 4d operator to the bulk mass of a 5d field .",
    "this is somewhat intuitive ",
    "the energy dependence of a operator is determined by its scaling dimension , and the @xmath89 dependence of a bulk field by its mass .",
    "so we assume @xmath196 is represented by the expectation value of a bulk scalar field @xmath197 .",
    "the scalar equations of motion in ads lead to @xmath198 spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the ir , at large @xmath89 , so @xmath199 represents the strength of this effect .",
    "similarly , explicit symmetry breaking due to quark masses , which is apparent even in the uv , corresponds to the @xmath200 term , which is more relevant at small @xmath89 .",
    "we will work in the massless quark limit for simplicity , and thus set @xmath201 .",
    "then the free parameter @xmath199 corresponds to the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath202 .",
    "so , the bulk action for the gauge fields in the ads background is @xmath203 note that the vector combination @xmath204 , does not have a bulk mass .",
    "so its first kk mode will be the same @xmath11 we introduced previously .",
    "for the axial section , we want to decouple @xmath194 and @xmath193 . to do this ,",
    "we introduce goldstone bosons and gauge - fix , following  @xcite .",
    "this separates the pions from the axial vectors .    after this gauge fixing , the kk equation for the axial vector is @xmath205 a_n ( z ) = 0\\ ] ] we can use this and the experimental @xmath206 mass to fix @xmath199 . with boundary conditions",

    "this is essentially set by the fact that we insist on having a massless mode .",

    "the coupling of @xmath1 to the pions is determined by general coordinate invariance .",
    "since everything is canonically normalized , we simply evaluate the overlap of the @xmath1 with the combination that appears in the kinetic term for @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath220 =    0.519 z_m g_f = 0.519 g_f \\label{gfpp}\\ ] ] so we predict for the @xmath36-independent ratio @xmath221 compared to the experimental value of @xmath222 this is off by a factor of 4 .",
    "using our previous result , @xmath223 mev@xmath224 , we get @xmath225 mev@xmath226 , and predict @xmath227 this also off from the experimental value of @xmath228 mev by a factor of 4 .",
    "this factor of 4 is from the same origin as the factor of @xmath229 discrepancy between @xmath230 from ads / qcd ( @xmath231 ) and @xmath230 from tmd .",
    "after all , in tmd , @xmath230 is extracted from the @xmath232 rate . in ads",
    "/ qcd , there is a conflict between the decay rates to photons and to pions , because they depend on the same parameters ; but we will now see that it is justifiable , and it is good that the photon rate is the one which comes out right .",
    "we can understand why the decay to photons was so accurate , but the decay to pions was so far off by looking at higher dimension operators . because the @xmath1 is heavy , @xmath233 mev , compared to the naive cutoff of the chiral lagrangian , @xmath234 mev",
    ", we expect chiral perturbation theory not to be accurate in the @xmath1 sector .",
    "we can also see the breakdown of perturbation theory on the ads side , by looking at where higher dimension derivative operators become relevant .",
    "let us now consider some of these operators , relevant to the @xmath186 process .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath186 we want operators linear in @xmath235 and quadratic in @xmath236 .",
    "the term we have been using to calculate @xmath237 was determined by general coordinate invariance and the @xmath20 kinetic term .",
    "it is , roughly , @xmath238 the number 0.209 comes from the @xmath89-integral , with the @xmath1 and @xmath20 wavefunctions .",
    "the difference from is because we have simplified the tensor structure , but it is the same order of magnitude .    a possible higher order term , leading to exactly the same 4d structure is @xmath239 this could come from the 5d general coordinate invariant term @xmath240 or @xmath241 which might come from @xmath242 where @xmath243 is invariant under @xmath244 .",
    "note that linearized @xmath245 ( the combination invariant under the above shift ) vanishes when the @xmath1 is on shell .",
    "we could assume that these terms are suppressed compared to the leading piece by some factors of the weak coupling constant @xmath85 .",
    "at best , we could use the 5d loop factor , and suppress by @xmath246 .",
    "thus the correction   contributes @xmath247 relative to the original term  , which is not a small effect . with the 4d loop factor , @xmath248 ,",
    "the new term is 1.5 times as important as the original . either way",
    ", there is no excuse to ignore the higher order corrections and we can not reasonably expect our rate @xmath186 to be at all accurate .",
    "in fact , it is surprising that we were even able to get the coupling constant to a factor of 2 .",
    "in contrast , consider the terms contributing to corrections to @xmath249 . at leading order , we had @xmath250 any correction to the @xmath18 rate has to come from a vertex with one @xmath235 and two @xmath251 .",
    "but the photon profile is flat , so any term with @xmath252 s acting on @xmath253 will vanish .",
    "terms with @xmath254 acting on @xmath253 ( like the riemann term above ) may appear , but they can not contribute to the decay rate because the photon is massless and transverse  there is nothing to which we may contract the new momentum factor .    one might worry that term such as @xmath255 could contribute if the derivatives are @xmath252 s and they act on the background metric . but",
    "the effect is then only to shift the coupling constant @xmath122 , which is unobservable because the renormalized coupling has been matched to qcd . another way to see",
    "this is that on shell @xmath256 which is the standard gauge kinetic term .",
    "thus , the contribution of   has already been accounted for in the definition of @xmath257 .",
    "so no operators , analogous to the ones relevant for the pion decay , affect the photon decay mode at all .    throughout",
    ", we have been ignoring boundary operators on the ir brane .",
    "but these can affect the photon decay rate , and should be included in a consistent effective field theory .",
    "the natural size of a term like @xmath258 is of order @xmath92 times @xmath259 , or about @xmath260 . comparing to",
    "we expect corrections of order @xmath261 to the @xmath1 photon coupling .",
    "in addition , some other assumption could be wrong .",
    "for example , @xmath146 corrections have not been included ",
    "we have assumed that qcd is conformal .",
    "so this can change the result as well . really , we could not have known ahead of time that we would get @xmath18 so precisely .",
    "nevertheless , the rate came out right , and it is suggestive that the contribution of boundary operators and violations of conformality are small .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 , which we have studied here , qcd has a whole tower of high spin resonances ( for example , the @xmath262 with spin 6 sits at 2510 mev ) . in this section ,",
    "we derive the predictions of ads / qcd for their masses , and compare to experiment .",
    "a spin @xmath263 state in qcd corresponds to a field @xmath264 in ads .",
    "ideally , we would like to write down an action for @xmath265 , but higher spin lagrangians are in general very complicated .",
    "for example , even at the free field level in flat space , one needs to introduce on the order of @xmath263 auxiliary fields to eliminate the propagation of unphysical modes .",
    "instead , we will take a more direct approach , and simply use symmetry arguments to guess the equations of motion for the transverse spin-@xmath263 modes .",
    "it is natural to expect the ads theory for @xmath265 to respect a linearized gauge invariance , under which @xmath266 such a symmetry allows us to go to an axial gauge in which @xmath267 . in ads ,",
    "it is not hard to show that this gauge is preserved under residual transformations with @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "this means that a field @xmath270 simply shifts under the 4d gauge transformation , and therefore represents a zero mode . in terms of @xmath271 , in this axial gauge , the lagrangian contains a piece @xmath272 and a similar piece with @xmath252 s acting directly on @xmath271 . thus the kk modes for",
    "a field of spin @xmath263 will satisfy @xmath273 note that this equation is just a naive generalization of and and matches previous results for spins @xmath47 and @xmath229 .",
    "we can confirm this result from ads / cft reasoning as well . on the qcd side ,",
    "the lowest dimension operator of spin @xmath263 , may contain terms like @xmath274 these operators are of dimension @xmath275 .",
    "under conformal transformations , operators scale based on their twist @xmath276 . thus a constant bulk field , representing the vev of such an operator , should vary as @xmath277 .",
    "the source for the operator @xmath278 has dimension @xmath279 and so it sources a field which varies like @xmath280 .",
    "this is the same ads zero mode solution we derived by symmetry arguments above .    the normalizable solutions to are @xmath281 .",
    "requiring neumann boundary conditions in the ir , we find that the mass of the lightest spin-@xmath263 particle is given by the first zero of @xmath282 .",
    "this leads to the following predictions for spin-@xmath263 resonances in qcd @xmath283 note that we have neglected the effects of quark masses and so we are not sensitive to isospin . in figure",
    "[ figspins ] , we plot the squared masses from this table as a function of spin .",
    "we also display the linear fit to the experimental values , which is the regge trajectory , and the quadratic curve through the ads / qcd points .",
    "note that the ads / qcd results take only @xmath284 from data , but provide a good estimate of both the intercept and slope of the regge trajectory .",
    "although the linear fit is an good match to data , the quadratic fit from ads / qcd seems to produce deviations at low energy in the right direction .",
    "it is expected that at higher energy , stringy effects are dominant , and we should merge smoothly back into the linear regime .",
    "[ figspins ]    we might try to calculate the decay rates of these particles as well .",
    "there are two main impediments .",
    "first , none of the decay modes are well measured .",
    "second , we do not know how to write down interactions for higher spin fields .",
    "for the spin-2 case , we used general coordinate invariance to guess the @xmath1 couplings .",
    "but for higher spin fields , it is impossible to find a consistent set of interactions ( there can be no higher spin conserved current ) , at least in flat space .",
    "yet we know massive higher spin fields exist in qcd , and we can try to guess these interactions , or perhaps compute them using the holographic map .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that despite obvious challenges , the ads / cft correspondence produces some remarkably accurate predictions about qcd .",
    "we saw that the mass for the @xmath1 meson and the rate for @xmath18 are in fantastic agreement with experiment .",
    "the @xmath18 prediction is particularly satisfying , because it is difficult to approach this decay through more traditional methods .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated that higher - dimension bulk operators do not affect this decay rate , and so our results are trustworthy . in contrast , we also calculated the rate for @xmath186 , which was off by a factor of 4 .",
    "this rate is sensitive to higher order corrections , and to our representation of chiral symmetry breaking in ads / cft .",
    "thus our results are predictions of a self - consistent effective field theory which matches remarkably well to qcd at leading order .",
    "we have also shown that the naive expectation from ads / cft , that the lightest state of a given spin is captured by the lowest dimension operator with that spin , seems to be favored by data .",
    "this indicates that not only is ads / qcd capable of quantitative success , but also that it may reveal interesting connections between qcd and its dual .",
    "for example , we have seen that the @xmath1 makes an awful 4d graviton .",
    "in contrast , on an ads@xmath285 background , general coordinate invariance allowed us to predict the @xmath1 coupling to photons correctly , making it a natural 5d graviton kk mode .",
