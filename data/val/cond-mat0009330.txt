    "the subject of molecular magnets has greatly advanced in recent years due to notable progress in synthesizing bulk samples of identical molecular - size units @xcite , each containing a relatively small number of paramagnetic ions (  spins \" ) that mutually interact via heisenberg exchange .",
    "an especially attractive feature of many of these systems is that the intermolecular magnetic interactions are utterly negligible as compared to the intramolecular interactions .",
    "already at this early stage it is clear that even heisenberg systems of relatively modest size pose a major theoretical challenge .",
    "a stunning example is provided by the recently synthesized molecular magnet @xcite \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } , where the 30 fe@xmath2 ions ( spins 5/2 ) occupy the sites of an icosidodecahedron .",
    "the total dimension of the hilbert space for this spin system is a staggering @xmath3 , namely of order avogadro s number , utterly precluding the calculation of the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors on any imagined configuration of immense , ultra - fast computers .",
    "this is the context for our exploration in this article of a generic feature of the low - lying excitation energies of a finite number of spins interacting via antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange . with the knowledge of the low - lying excitations",
    "one can establish the very low temperature properties and in some cases even arrive at an estimate of the temperature range for the manifestation of essentially quantum behavior .",
    "this is illustrated in the present article for \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } ; we arrive at an expression for the temperature dependence of the weak - field susceptibility at very low temperatures .",
    "we also provide an estimate for the temperature above which this system can reliably be described by the classical heisenberg model , a far more practical theoretical platform than the corresponding quantum model .",
    "indeed the classical heisenberg model is currently being exploited so as to provide detailed quantitative predictions @xcite for \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } that are being compared to the results of ongoing experiments.@xcite    in this article we focus on a generic feature of highly symmetric geometric arrays ( ring structures or polytopes ) housing a finite number of spins interacting via antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange .",
    "whatever the intrinsic spin of the individual paramagnetic ions , or the specific geometrical symmetries of the spin array , there always exist what we refer to as rotational modes . besides their intrinsic interest",
    ", we show that the knowledge of these modes can in many cases be used to obtain good estimates of physical observables , such as the magnetic susceptibility at very low temperatures .",
    "we consider in the following a finite number , @xmath4 , of quantum spins , each of intrinsic spin @xmath5 , that in most examples interact via nearest - neighbor isotropic heisenberg exchange .",
    "we assume that all nearest - neighbor pairs of spins interact with the same coupling constant , one which favors antiferromagnetic ordering . if @xmath6 denotes the total spin operator , the operator @xmath7 commutes with the hamilton operator , and thus we can structure the set of all energy eigenvalues according to the total spin quantum number @xmath8 , extending up to @xmath9 . a key point of the present work relates to the subset of minimal energies for the allowed values of @xmath8 .",
    "we may summarize our findings as follows : _ whatever the details of the system , this subset of minimal energies appears to define what we shall refer to as a  rotational band \" , i.e. , is well approximated by a dependence on @xmath8 of the form @xmath10 .",
    "_ we choose the term  rotational band \" to indicate that this portion of the spectrum is similar to that of a rigid rotor .",
    "similar behavior is commonly found also in nuclear and atomic physics .",
    "the occurrence of a rotational band has been noted on several occasions for an even number of spins defining a ring structure .",
    "the minimal energies have been described @xcite as  following the land interval rule \" .",
    "however , we find that the same property also occurs for rings with an odd number of spins as well as for the various polytope configurations we have investigated , in particular for quantum spins positioned on the vertices of a tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , icosahedron , triangular prism , and an axially truncated icosahedron .",
    "rotational modes have also been found in the context of finite triangular lattices of spin-@xmath11 heisenberg antiferromagnets @xcite .    using only the sublattice structure of the various spin arrays , which is provided by symmetry arguments , we are able to approximate the coefficient of the @xmath10 dependence to good accuracy .",
    "our method describes in general how this approximate coefficient can be deduced .",
    "we can therefore obtain an estimate of the ground state energy as well as the low - lying rotational excitations .",
    "it is clear that at low temperatures these minimal energies provide the major contribution to thermal averages .",
    "this enables us to discuss the low - temperature behavior of quantities such as the magnetic susceptibility without knowledge of the complete eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "we illustrate these considerations for the special case of \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}.    the layout of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec-2 ] we present our numerical findings for various heisenberg spin systems and motivate in sec .",
    "[ sec-3 ] how the rotational band is connected to the topology of spin sites . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec-4 ] we discuss some implications of the rotational band on physical observables .",
    "the hamilton operator for the isotropic heisenberg model in the absence of an external magnetic field reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the exchange interaction with units of energy , and @xmath14 results in antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "the vector operators @xmath15 , underlined with a tilde , are the single - particle spin operators with eigenvalue equations @xmath16 the sum in runs over all distinct interacting pairs @xmath17 of spins at positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for",
    "a closed ring with nearest - neighbor interaction the index @xmath19 would simply equal @xmath20 and the sum is understood to fulfill the cyclic boundary condition .",
    "one of the few systems that possesses a rigorous parabolic rotational band is the heisenberg square , i.e. , a ring with @xmath21 . because the hamilton operator can be rewritten as @xmath22 with all spin operators @xmath7 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 commuting with each other and with @xmath25",
    ", one can directly obtain the complete set of eigenenergies and these are characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , the lowest energy for a given total spin quantum number @xmath8 occurs for the choice @xmath28 @xmath29 = e_0 - j\\,s\\,(s+1 ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the exact ground state energy .",
    "the various energies @xmath31 form a rigorous parabolic rotational band of excitation energies .",
    "therefore , these energies coincide with a parabolic fit ( crosses connected by the dashed line on the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 1 ] ) passing through the antiferromagnetic ground state energy and the highest energy level , i.e. , the ground state energy of the corresponding ferromagnetically coupled system .",
    "we have calculated all energy levels by diagonalizing @xcite the hamilton matrix for a variety of rings with different values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "all of these systems exhibit a rotational band , irrespective whether @xmath4 is even or odd and for both integer and half - integer values of @xmath5 .",
    "that is , the subset of minimal energies is well approximated by a dependence on @xmath8 which is proportional to @xmath33 , i.e. , follows the land interval rule @xcite , @xmath34 we determine the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 so that formula ( [ e-2 - 13 ] ) reproduces our calculated values of the lowest and highest energies of the rotational band , i.e. , the ground state energy of the antiferromagnetic system and the ground state energy of the corresponding ferromagnetic system . in all cases",
    "we have observed , that if deviations occur the fitting parabola of ( [ e-2 - 13 ] ) lies below the rotational band .",
    "use of ( [ e-2 - 13 ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 1 ] ( r.h.s . ) for the case @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the figure shows the complete spectrum ( horizontal dashes ) as well as the fit according to ( crosses connected by a dashed line ) .",
    "one observes that the fit very nearly matches the energies of the rotational band , meaning that the land interval rule is obeyed with high accuracy . as a second example",
    ", spectra are shown for rings of five spins with @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 2 ] , l.h.s . ) and @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 2 ] , r.h.s . ) .",
    "inspecting the low - lying excitations one notices that the rotational band for odd rings is not separated from the remaining states as much as it is for even rings .",
    "this remark also pertains to other , larger odd values of @xmath4 .    in table [ t-1 ] we collect the coefficients @xmath36 for the rings we have investigated . in all cases @xmath41 . for the odd rings the values of @xmath42 may be somewhat smaller than four .",
    "we will dwell on this fact in sec .",
    "[ sec-3 ] .",
    "it should be noted that in the large-@xmath4-limit the rotational levels ( [ e-2 - 13 ] ) become degenerate since @xmath36 remains finite .",
    "therefore , excitations within the rotational band should not be confused with magnons .      even for spin rings with next - nearest neighbor interaction the rotational band persists .",
    "the energy spectra of fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 5 ] have been calculated for the hamilton operator @xmath43 where all spins have been taken to be @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 5 ] we display spectra for a ring with @xmath37 and @xmath38 for various ratios of the two coupling constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "although details of the spectra differ , the overall appearance persists , and in particular the minimal energies define a rotational band .      in order to illustrate the generality of the rotational band we provide several additional examples , the tetrahedron , the cube ( fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 3 ] ) , the octahedron ( fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 4 ] , l.h.s . ) , and the icosahedron ( fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 4 ] , r.h.s . ) . as in the previous cases",
    "the displayed energy eigenvalues are calculated by numerical diagonalization , except for the tetrahedron and octahedron which can be solved analytically .",
    "the tetrahedron of spins is a worthy textbook problem ; it can be solved with a few lines of algebra because the hamilton operator simplifies to @xmath47 therefore , the spectrum of this system consists exclusively of a rotational band .",
    "the case of the octahedron is similar to the heisenberg square ; the hamilton operator can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are the sums for pairs of spins situated at opposite vertices of the octahedron , and @xmath6 is the total spin .",
    "the spin operators @xmath7 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 commute with each other and with @xmath25 .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath25 may be written down at once and they are given in terms of the quantum numbers @xmath8 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . therefore , the lowest energy for a given value of @xmath8 is achieved if @xmath58 , and its value is given by @xmath59 \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is another one of the few cases where the minimal energies define a rigorous rotational band ( see fig .  [ f-2 - 4 ] , l.h.s . ) .    the remaining examples of the cube ( fig .  [ f-2 - 3 ] ) and the icosahedron ( fig .  [ f-2 - 4 ] , r.h.s . )",
    "illustrate the behavior of the gaps between the rotational band and the remaining eigenenergies .",
    "it is worth noting that the rotational band of the icosahedron is not as well separated from higher energy levels as it is for the cube .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that discussed above for even and odd rings .",
    "systems which are bipartite , i.e. , can be subdivided into two sublattices with interactions only between spins of different sublattices ( rings with even @xmath4 and the cube ) , show a significant gap , whereas systems , that are non - bipartite appear to show much smaller gaps.@xcite the latter systems are often also called frustrated.@xcite two other cases we have studied , the equilateral triangle prism and an axially truncated icosahedron , conform with these trends .",
    "it turns out that an accurate approximate formula for the coefficient @xmath36 of can be developed using the sublattice structure of the spin array . as an introductory example we repeat the basic ideas for heisenberg rings with an even number of spin sites @xcite .",
    "such rings are bipartite and can be decomposed into two sublattices , labeled @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with every second spin belonging to the same sublattice . from classical spin dynamics",
    "it is known that the classical ground state , sometimes called the classical nel state @xcite , is given by an alternating sequence of opposite spin directions . on each sublattice",
    "the spins are mutually parallel .",
    "therefore , a quantum trial state , where the individual spins on each sublattice are coupled to their maximum values , @xmath62 , could be expected to provide a reasonable approximation to the true ground state , especially if @xmath5 assumes large values .",
    "such trial states are called nel - like . for rings with",
    "even @xmath4 the approximation to the respective minimal energies for each value of the total spin @xmath63",

    "for all smaller @xmath8 the approximate minimal energy @xmath68 is bounded from below by the true one ( rayleigh - ritz variational principle ) .",
    "the solid curve displays this behavior for the example of @xmath37 , @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ f-2 - 1 ] ( r.h.s . ) .",
    "the entries in table [ t-1 ] provide additional numerical support for the approximation @xmath41 adopted in ( [ e-2 - 7 ] ) .",
    "for each fixed even @xmath4 the coefficient @xmath36 approaches 4 with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the approximate spectrum , , is similar to that of two spins , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , each of spin quantum number @xmath71 , that are coupled by an effective interaction of strength @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , one can equally well say , that the approximate rotational band considered in ( [ e-2 - 7 ] ) is associated with an effective hamilton operator @xmath73 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two sublattice spins , @xmath74 , assume their maximal value @xmath75 .",
    "this result agrees with that obtained by a different procedure , which utilizes a fourier representation of the hamilton operator.@xcite    in retrospect one realizes that all we needed for rings with even @xmath4 to arrive at ( [ e-2 - 7 ] ) was a sublattice structure in order to build nel - like trial states .",
    "the sublattice structure can be deduced from the classical ground state or the symmetries of the spin array , which manifest themself in the classical ground state . in the case of rings with an even number of sites",
    "the symmetry is the cyclic shift symmetry : sublattice @xmath60 can be transformed into sublattice @xmath61 by a single shift .",
    "these considerations lead us in the following subsection to a generalization for other systems .",
    "we assume that the heisenberg spin system can be decomposed into @xmath76 sublattices according to a symmetry transformation .",
    "the spins of each sublattice are to be coupled to their maximal values @xmath77 .",
    "then we conjecture that the energies of the rotational band can be approximated as @xmath78 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath79 is to be fixed by the requirement that the energy @xmath80 of the corresponding ferromagnetic ground state , for which @xmath65 , is reproduced exactly .",
    "the energy @xmath81 depends only on the number of distinct bonds @xmath82 . therefore , the coefficient @xmath79 is given by @xmath83 which is independent of @xmath5 . for rings with an even number of sites",
    "this formula reproduces the value @xmath84 , whereas for the cube , which has @xmath85 , it gives @xmath86 . that these values of @xmath79 provide a very good estimate of the coefficients @xmath36 is demonstrated in fig .",

    "if there are several possible partitions into sublattices according to various symmetries of the spin array one can safely choose that one which leads to the lowest approximate ground state energy , because this energy is bounded from below by the true ground state energy .",
    "for spin arrays with low symmetry the gained approximation can be rather poor .",
    "this is for instance the case for rings of odd @xmath4 .",
    "the classical ground state structure would suggest as many sublattices as spin sites , which leads to rather small coefficients @xmath79 as depicted in table [ t-1 ] (  simple conjecture \" ) .",
    "a closer inspection shows that it is possible to obtain a better approximation if one defines the approximate rotational band by the parabola passing through the classical nel ground state energy level and through the ground state energy level of the corresponding ferromagnetic system . for rings of odd",
    "@xmath4 the classical nel ground state energy is @xmath88 as can be shown using spin coherent states.@xcite this leads to the  refined conjecture \" for odd rings , see table [ t-1 ] . for other spin arrays , such as the icosahedron",
    ", it may be simply impossible to derive a good approximation for the coefficient @xmath36 , nevertheless , the minimal energies always form a rotational band according to .    using ( [ e-2 - 11 ] ) and ( [ e-2 - 12 ] ) one can find an approximation for the rotational band for larger polytopes such as the icosidodecahedron , which characterizes the sites of the 30 paramagnetic fe@xmath2 ions in the recently synthesized molecular magnet @xcite \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}. the related hilbert space has a dimension of @xmath89 which is of the order of avogadro s number .",
    "numerical diagonalization of the hamilton matrix is totally out of reach .",
    "nevertheless , we can estimate both the ground state energy and the form of the rotational band .",
    "the icosidodecahedron , consisting of 20 triangles and 12 pentagons , has threefold rotational symmetry and thus three sublattices .",
    "assuming nearest neighbor interaction , we have @xmath90 .",
    "thus , one ends up with @xmath91 the threefold rotational symmetry of the spin array is also reflected by the structure of the classical ground state , thus it is no surprise that quantum and classical nel ground state energies , @xmath92 differ from each other only by 4% for the rather high @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that at low temperatures the rotational band energies provide the dominant contribution to thermal averages , especially if these energies are well separated from the remaining energy levels .",

    "not much is known about the degeneracy .",
    "first investigations show that it is possible to establish rules for the degeneracy of certain states also for non - bipartite systems.@xcite for the approximate rotational energies we take the degeneracies to be that resulting from the coupling of the sublattice spins .",
    "@xcite it might be that the full hamiltonian lifts this degeneracy somewhat , nevertheless this procedure provides a reasonable approximation for the degeneracies of the true minimal energies .",

    "[ f-3 - 6 ] one sees how the rotational band contributes to the susceptibility in the case of the ring with @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",
    "the rise at low temperatures is mostly determined by the first excited level of the rotational band ( dashed curve labeled 1 ) .    as our final example",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f-10 ] the result using ( [ e-2 - 21 ] ) and ( [ e-3 - 31 ] ) for the low temperature behavior of the zero - field susceptibility for \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}. for this system @xmath98 .",
    "the susceptibility ( solid curve ) rises very rapidly with increasing temperature to the result @xcite for the classical heisenberg model ( dash - dot curve ) . inspecting one can understand that the rapid rise is due to the small energy difference between ground and first excited state and in particular because of the small coefficient @xmath99 of the @xmath33 term .",
    "in addition the @xmath100 level of the approximate rotational band is 9-fold degenerate and thus the rapid rise in @xmath101 commences at very low temperatures .",
