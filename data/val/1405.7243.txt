    "an iron calorimeter ( ical ) detector is proposed to be built at the india - based neutrino observatory ( ino ) @xcite at theni in southern india .",
    "the ical detector consists of 151 layers of magnetised iron plates interleaved with resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) as active detector element with a total mass of about 52 ktons .",
    "it is designed primarily to study neutrino flavor oscillations through interactions of atmospheric neutrinos in the detector @xcite .",
    "the main goals of the ical detector are to make precision measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and more importantly , to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , the sign of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "these goals can be achieved by observing charged - current ( cc ) interactions of atmospheric muon neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) in the detector .",
    "an accurate determination of the muon energy and direction is crucial to achieve the neutrino oscillation physics goals .",
    "these muons ( and sometimes also associated hadrons ) arise from the cc interactions of atmospheric @xmath4 and @xmath6 in the detector ; both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 oscillation channels are sources of @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "hence the muons produced in the detector are sensitive to the pattern of neutrino flavour oscillations and in turn can be used to probe the neutrino oscillation parameters of interest .",
    "in addition , the muon energy and direction information can be combined with that of the hadrons to directly recover the energy and direction of the neutrinos .",
    "while cc @xmath9 interactions produce electrons in the final state , ical is not optimised to reconstruct their energy and direction with high precision due to their rapid energy loss mechanisms in the dense iron .    as @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "pass through the earth matter , they undergo different interactions depending on the mass hierarchy .",
    "hence , the hierarchy may be determined by observing individual event rates for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which give rise to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , in cc interactions .",
    "therefore , the ical detector must be optimised to correctly identify the charge of muons .    in this paper , we present for the first time a geant4-based simulation study of the response of the ical detector to muons .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux peaks at a few hundred mevs , and then falls rapidly with neutrino energy with roughly an @xmath12 dependence .",
    "in contrast , the interaction cross - section only increases linearly with energy .",
    "hence events in the detector are dominantly of lower energy , below 20 gev .",
    "we therefore study the reconstruction efficiency , momentum resolution , angular resolution and the charge identification efficiency of muons in the ( 120 ) gev / c momentum regime .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we describe the ical detector geometry and the nature of the magnetic field applied in the detector . in section 3",
    "we briefly explain our procedure to simulate muon tracks in the detector and algorithms to reconstruct their momentum and charge . the kalman filter is briefly described in appendix a. we use these algorithms in section 4 to obtain the response of the ical detector to fixed - energy , fixed - direction muons . in particular",
    ", we present here the up / down discrimination ability and angle resolution for a sample of 10000 muons with fixed energy and zenith angle .",
    "we also study the muon momentum resolution in certain azimuthal angle bins , depending on the magnetic field distribution .",
    "( some details on the choice of azimuthal bins are presented in appendix b. ) we then determine the azimuthal - averaged momentum reconstruction efficiencies and charge - identification ( cid ) efficiency of muons .",
    "the detector response to muons has been already used to study the physics reach of ical with respect to precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters as well as determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we conclude with discussions in section 5 .",
    "the proposed ical detector has a modular structure and its geometry has been simulated using the geant4 package available from the european center for nuclear research ( cern ) @xcite .",
    "the full detector consists of three modules , each of size 16  m @xmath13 16  m @xmath13 14.45  m , placed along the @xmath14 direction , with a gap of 20  cm between them .",
    "the direction along which the modules are placed is labelled as the @xmath14-direction with the remaining horizontal transverse direction being labelled @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16-axis points vertically upwards so that the polar angle equals the zenith angle @xmath17 .",
    "the origin is taken to be the centre of the central module .",
    "each module comprises 151 horizontal layers of 5.6  cm thick iron plates of size 16  m @xmath13 16  m @xmath13 5.6  cm with a vertical gap of 4  cm , interleaved with rpcs .",
    "the basic rpc units of size 1.84  m @xmath13 1.84  m @xmath13 2.5  cm are placed in grid - format within the air gap , with a 16  cm horizontal gap between them accommodating steel support structures in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions .",
    "hence the iron sheets are supported every 2 m in both the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions .",
    "vertical slots at @xmath18 cm ( where @xmath19 is the central @xmath14 value of each module ) extending up to @xmath20 cm and cutting through all layers are provided to accommodate the four copper coils that wind around the iron plates , providing an @xmath14-@xmath15 magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfield ] . in the central region of each module ,",
    "typical values of the field strength are about 1.5 t in the @xmath15-direction as obtained from simulations using magnet6.26 software @xcite . the detector excluding the coils weighs about 52 kton , with 98% iron where neutrino interactions are dominantly expected to occur , and less than 2% glass of the rpcs .      the magnetic field lines in a single iron plate in the central module are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfield ] .",
    "the arrows denote the direction of magnetic field lines while the length of the arrows ( or the shading ) indicates the magnitude of the field .",
    "notice that the field direction reverses on the two sides of the coil slots ( beyond @xmath214  m ) in the @xmath14-direction . in between the coil slots ( an 8  m @xmath13 8  m square area in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane ) the field is maximum and nearly uniform in both magnitude ( to about 10% ) and direction",
    "; we refer to this as the _ central region_. near the edges in the @xmath14 direction ( outside the coil slots ) the field is also fairly uniform , but in the opposite direction ; this is called the _",
    "side region_. near the edges in the @xmath15 direction , i.e. , in the regions @xmath22  m @xmath23  m , both the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field vary considerably ; this region is labelled as the _ peripheral region_.",
    "the field has been generated in the centre of the iron plate , viz .",
    ", at @xmath24 , and has been assumed uniform over the entire thickness of the iron plate at every @xmath25 position .",
    "since the field falls off by many orders of magnitude in the 4  cm air gap between the iron plates , it is taken to be zero in these regions .",
    "the magnetic field is also taken to be zero in the ( non - magnetic ) steel support structures .",
    "therefore there is neither a magnetic field nor an active detector element in the region of the support structures ; these , along with the coil slot , form the bulk of the dead spaces of the detector .    ) , as generated by the magnet6 software .",
    "the length and direction of the arrows indicate the magnitude and direction of the field ; the magnitude is also shown ( in t ) according to the colour - coding indicated on the right.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the side and peripheral regions are beset by edge effects as well as by rapidly changing and smaller magnitude of the magnetic field ; these regions will be studied separately in order to understand the impact on fiducial volume , etc .",
    "we confine ourselves , in the present study , to tracks generated only in the central region ( @xmath26 m @xmath27 m and @xmath26 m @xmath28 m ) , although the particle may subsequently travel outside this region or even exit the detector .",
    "the magnetic field thus breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the detector geometry .      in order to appreciate the hit pattern in the simulated detector it is necessary to describe the active detector elements , the rpcs .",
    "these are glass chambers made by sealing two 3 mm thick glass sheets with a uniform gap of 2 mm using plastic edges and spacers through which a mixture of r134a ( @xmath29 95% ) , isobutane and trace amounts of sf@xmath30 gas continually flows , with a high dc voltage across them . in brief , the working principle of an rpc is the ionisation of the gaseous medium when a charged particle passes through it . the combination of gases keeps the signal localised and the location is used to track the charged particle through the detector . for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the component most relevant to the simulation and track reconstruction is a 150 micron thick copper sheet pasted on the _ inside _ of a 5 mm thick foam ( for structural strength and electrical insulation ) placed both above and below the glass chamber .",
    "the copper sheet ( pasted on the side of the foam facing the glass ) is insulated from the glass by a few sheets of mylar and is used to inductively pick up the signal when a charged particle traverses the chamber .",
    "this layer is scored through with grooves to form strips of width 1.96 cm in such a way that the strips above and below are transverse to each other , that is , in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions .",
    "these pick - up strips thus provide the @xmath14 and @xmath15 location of the charged particle as it traverses the rpc . a timing resolution of about 1.0 ns",
    "is assumed as also an efficiency of 95% , consistent with observations of rpcs that have been built as part of the r & d for ical @xcite .",
    "the ical detector is most sensitive to muons .",
    "muons being minimum ionizing particles leave long , clean , tracks in the detector . the muon momentum can be determined from the curvature of its track as it propagates in the magnetized detector and also by measuring its path length . due to the precise ( nanosecond ) response time of rpcs",
    ", the up - coming muons can be distinguished from down - going muons .",
    "this is essential since neutrinos produced in the atmosphere on the other side of the earth have different oscillation signatures at the detector than those produced on the same side .",
    "the charge of the muon can also be found from the direction of curvature of the track and this in turn distinguishes @xmath4 and @xmath6 interactions .",
    "in contrast , the energy of hadrons is determined from the total number of hits in a hadron shower @xcite .",
    "a typical neutrino cc interaction giving rise to an event with a muon track and associated hadron shower is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : samplevicetrack ] .",
    "it can be seen that the muon track is clean with typically 1 hit per layer . in the case of multiple tracks ,",
    "the reconstructed track closest to the vertex is considered as the muon track .    ,",
    "@xmath31 , and @xmath32 axes are in m and the region containing the track corresponds to the central region of the detector.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the muon track reconstruction is based on a kalman filter algorithm @xcite that takes into account the local magnetic field . the structure of each of these algorithms is briefly described below .",
    "details of the reconstruction code can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "when a charged particle , for example , a muon , goes through an rpc , it gives a signal which is counted as a `` hit '' in the detector with assigned @xmath14 or @xmath15 values from the respective pick - up strip information , a @xmath16-value from the layer information , and a time stamp @xmath33 .",
    "the hit information is digitised , keeping in mind the strip width so that the spatial resolution in the horizontal plane is of the order of cm ( due to the strip width ) while that in the @xmath16 direction is of the order of mm ( due to the gas gap between the glass plates in the rpcs ) .",
    "on - going studies of rpcs @xcite in the ino labs have also given information on cross - talk , the probability of both adjacent strips giving signals in the detector .",
    "this has also been incorporated into the analysis .",
    "in addition , since the @xmath14 and @xmath15 strip information are independent , all the possible pairs of nearby @xmath14 and @xmath15 hits in a plane are combined to form a cluster .",
    "a set of clusters generated in a few successive layers is called a tracklet .    [",
    "[ the - track - finder ] ] the track finder + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    : clusters form the basic elements for the track finder algorithm .",
    "typically , muons leave only about one hit per layer they traverse ( @xmath34 , on average ) while hadrons and electrons , due to the very different nature of their energy loss mechanisms , give showers which leave several hits per layer . including the possibility of cross - talk ( which gives the possibility of more than one hit in a plane for muons as well ) , the separation / rejection of hadronic showers is done by an algorithm that uses a cut on the total number of hits in a given rpc module .",
    "the track finder algorithm uses a simple curve fitting algorithm to find possible tracklets by finding clusters in three adjacent planes .",
    "the finder includes the possibility of no hit ( due to inefficiency ) in a given plane ; in this case it considers the adjoining planes as well .",
    "adjacent tracklets are associated into tracks and the longest possible tracks are found @xcite by iteration of this process .",
    "the direction ( up / down ) of the track is calculated from the timing information which is averaged over the @xmath14 and @xmath15 timing values in a plane .",
    "the track finder also separates out tracks as  shower - like \" or ",
    "muon - like \" ; for the case of muon - like tracks which have at least 5 hits in the event , the clusters in a layer are averaged to yield a single hit per layer with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and timing information and are sent to the track fitter for further analysis .",
    "this translates to a minimum momentum of about 0.4 gev / c for a nearly vertical muon ( @xmath35 in the absence of the magnetic field ) below which no track is fitted .",
    "[ [ the - track - fitter ] ] the track fitter + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    : a kalman - filter based algorithm is used to fit the tracks based on the bending of the tracks in the magnetic field .",
    "every track is identified by a starting vector @xmath36 which contains the position of the earliest hit @xmath37 as recorded by the finder , with the charge - weighted inverse momentum @xmath38 taken to be zero .",
    "since the tracks are virtually straight in the starting section , the initial track direction is calculated from the first two layers .",
    "this initial state vector is then extrapolated to the next layer using a standard kalman - filter based algorithm described briefly in appendix a , using the information on the local magnetic field and the geometry and composition of the matter through which the particle propagates .",
    "the state extrapolation takes into account process noise due to multiple scattering as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and energy loss in matter , mostly iron , according to the bethe formula @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated point is compared with the actual location of a hit in that layer , if any , and the process is iterated .    as stated earlier ,",
    "clusters are first associated into tracklets .",
    "the ends of the overlapping tracklets are matched to form a single longer track .",
    "typically , tracks from charged current muon neutrino interactions in ical have a single long track due to the muons and a shower from the hadrons near the vertex .",
    "there are rarely two or more tracks .",
    "the track closest to the vertex is then identified as the muon track . for single muons in the detector , as in the studies presented here ,",

    "the track is then extrapolated to another half - layer of iron ( since the interaction is most likely to have taken place in the iron ) to determine the vertex of the interaction and the best fit value of the momentum at the vertex is returned as the reconstructed momentum ( both in magnitude and direction ) . while @xmath38 determines the magnitude of the momentum at the vertex , the direction is reconstructed using @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which yield @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "only fits for which the quality of fit is better than @xmath43 are used in the analysis ( similar results are obtained with a tighter selection criterion ) .    each muon track",

    "we propagate 10000 muons uniformly from a vertex randomly located in the @xmath44 volume which comprises the central region of the central module of the detector where the magnetic field is uniform . for this analysis",
    "we have considered events with the @xmath16 coordinate of the input vertex position to be @xmath45 cm .",
    "only the vertex position is confined to the central region ; the particle , by virtue of its momentum and position , may travel outside this region and exit the detector altogether as well .",
    "the effect of the peripheral region of the detector , including the edge events , will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "while the input momentum and zenith angle are kept fixed in each case , the azimuthal angle is uniformly average over the entire range @xmath46 .    in each case",
    ", we study the number of tracks reconstructed , the direction reconstruction , including up / down discrimination , and zenith angle resolution .",
    "next we go on to study the muon momentum resolution ; an additional selection criterion is required in order to obtain good momentum resolution .",
    "furthermore , we will find that the azimuthal dependence is non - trivial . the momentum reconstruction efficiency and the relative charge identification efficiency",
    "are computed for those events that pass the additional selection criterion and are discussed at the end of the section .",

    "[ fig : mu+- ] the histogram of reconstructed momentum @xmath49 gev / c is plotted for tracks with quality of fit such that @xmath50 , for input values @xmath51 . the ratio of successfully reconstructed tracks to the total number of events is the track reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the results for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are virtually identical as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mu+- ] .",
    "hence , only results for @xmath47 are presented in what follows .",
    "typically ( except for very horizontal events with @xmath52 ) , the track reconstruction efficiency for events with momentum @xmath53 gev / c is around 90% and rises to 95% by 5 gev / c or more .",
    "in addition , both fully contained and partially contained events ( where only a part of the track of a muon is contained in the detector since it exits the detector without stopping ) are considered for analysis . at low energies ,",
    "the tracks are fully contained while particles start to leave the detector region by @xmath54 gev / c , depending on the location of the vertex and the zenith angle of the event .",
    "we now go on to study the quality of reconstruction .",
    "we begin with the up - down discrimination ability .",
    "smeared over the central volume of the detector for @xmath10 and @xmath11 particles.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the zenith angle is also the polar angle , @xmath17 , where @xmath55 indicates an up - going ( down - going ) muon . the reconstructed zenith angle distribution for muons with @xmath56 gev / c at large and small angles , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] .",
    "it can be seen that a few events are reconstructed in the opposite ( downward ) direction to the input direction @xmath59 , i.e. , with reconstructed zenith angle @xmath60 . for muons with @xmath56 gev / c at large ( small ) angles with @xmath61 ,",
    "this fraction is about 4.3 ( 1.5)% .",
    "the fraction of events reconstructed in the wrong direction drastically reduces with energy ; for example , this fraction is 0.3% for muons with @xmath62 gev / c at @xmath63 .",
    "it is seen that while the number of tracks reconstructed is also small at large angles , it rapidly improves at smaller angles , even for low momenta .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis in what follows to @xmath64 or larger .",
    "the @xmath17 resolution is the width obtained by fitting the reconstructed zenith angle distribution with gaussian probability distribution functions ( pdf ) .",
    "the events distribution as a function of the reconstructed @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for a sample input @xmath65 .",
    "it is seen that the distribution is very narrow , less than a degree , indicating a good angular resolution for muons .    ;",
    "@xmath66.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the @xmath17 resolution is shown as a function of input momentum for different zenith angles in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the resolution quickly improves with input momentum , being better than a degree for all input angles for @xmath67 gev / c . beyond 10 gev / c , the curves approximately coincide .",
    "we will see in the next section that an additional selection criterion on the reconstructed events is required in order to obtain good momentum resolution .",
    "however , the angle resolution remains practically the same even when we analyse only the fraction of events whose momenta are successfully reconstructed for their angular resolution .",
    "the momentum resolution , @xmath68 , is defined ( with its error @xmath69 ) in terms of the rms width @xmath70 of the histogram of reconstructed momentum , @xmath49 , as , @xmath71    low energy distributions show a clear asymmetric tail ( as shown in fig .",

    "the width is defined as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 full width at half maximum , in order to make a consistent and meaningful comparison with the gaussian fits at higher energies , where the square root of the variance or the rms width equals fwhm/2.35 .",
    "while the histograms at higher energies show no asymmetric tails , they fit poorly to gaussian distributions , with @xmath80 or more .",
    "this is because of the presence of detector dead spaces .",
    "these dead spaces generically worsen the quality of reconstruction and have two specific , significant effects :    * sometimes the kalman filter reconstruction algorithm reconstructs two portions of a track traversing a support structure as two disjoint tracks , with the separate track portions giving a somewhat or significantly lower fit to the momentum depending on whether it was the earlier or latter part of the track ( since the false tracks which are only sections of the single correct one , have arbitrary intermediate vertices where the momentum is reconstructed ) .",
    "this issue is particularly severe for small angle tracks which are more vertically oriented when the two portions of the track on either side of the support structure may be displaced by several layers along the @xmath16 axis with respect to each other .",
    "the problem is also more severe in the case of higher energy muons , which are more likely to traverse such spaces in the detector due to the longer length of the tracks .",
    "for genuine neutrino events at such energies , the hadron shower associated with these muon tracks will help select the true vertex and reject the spurious , displaced ones .",
    "hence such events may be safely removed from the analysis of pure muon events ; this , while improving the momentum resolution , will worsen the momentum reconstruction efficiency , especially at small angles . + this is the additional selection criterion mentioned above .",
    "* notice that the response of the detector has been averaged over the entire azimuth .",
    "however , for the same zenith angle , @xmath41 , muons with different azimuthal angles have different response .",
    "there are several reasons for the @xmath42 dependence : the coil gaps that are located at @xmath18 cm where @xmath19 is the centre of each module in the @xmath14 direction ; the support structures , which have different dimensions in the @xmath14- and @xmath15-directions ; and also the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the cumulative @xmath42 dependence is a complex consequence of all these dependences .",
    "+ for instance , a muon initially directed along the @xmath15-axis experiences less bending since the momentum component in the plane of the iron plates ( henceforth referred to as in - plane momentum ) is parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , upward - going muons that are in the negative ( positive ) @xmath14 direction experience a force in the positive ( negative ) @xmath16 direction ( the opposite is be true for @xmath11 ) and so muons injected with @xmath81 traverse more layers than those with the same energy and zenith angle but with @xmath82 and hence are better reconstructed .",
    "this is illustrated in the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] which shows two muons ( @xmath10 ) injected at the origin with the same momentum magnitude and zenith angle , one with positive momentum component in the @xmath14 direction , @xmath83 and the other with negative @xmath14 momentum component .",
    "the muon with @xmath83 ( initially directed in the positive @xmath14 direction ) bends differently than the one with @xmath84 ( along negative @xmath14 direction ) and hence they traverse different number of layers , while having roughly the same path length .",

    "+ ) in the @xmath14-@xmath16 plane for the same values of @xmath85 but with @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( momentum component in the @xmath14 direction positive and negative respectively ) .",
    "the different bending causes the muon to traverse different number of layers in the two cases.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     because of these effects , the momentum resolution is best studied in different azimuthal angle bins ( see appendix b for more details about the choice of the bins ) .      in all cases ,",
    "we separate our muon sample into four bins : bin i with @xmath88 , bin ii with @xmath89 , bin iii with @xmath90 , and bin iv with @xmath91 .",
    "[ fig : sv_4_65 ] shows the gaussian fits for the reconstructed histogram of the reconstructed momentum @xmath49 for input values of @xmath92 gev / c and @xmath93 in different @xmath42 regions .",
    "+    as can be seen , the quality of fits are reasonable . both the mean and the width of the distributions for the four sets vary ; the former by about @xmath94 across all sets , and the latter by more than @xmath95 .",
    "this is why the fits to the combined data sets are relatively poor ( @xmath96 ) while , on separating these events , the fits are vastly improved , with good fits and acceptable @xmath97 in each region . in particular , marginally more events are reconstructed in phi bins i and iv due to the effect of the magnetic field , while the resolution is best in bins iii and iv , as discussed earlier .",
    "the momentum resolution as a function of input momentum for different values of @xmath41 in the different @xmath42 bins is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sv_e_ct ] for momenta from 220 gev / c .",
    "it can be seen that initially ( upto about 6 gev / c ) , the resolution improves with increasing energy .",
    "this is because , at such small momenta , as the momentum increases , the number of rpc layers crossed by the muons also increases , thus increasing the number of layers and hits ; in addition , the magnetic field causes appreciable bending so the accuracy of momentum reconstruction also increases .",
    "thus the resolution improves .",
    "+    as the input momentum increases further , the particle begins to exit the detector , so that only a partial track is contained in the detector ; this comprises relatively straight sections since the radius of curvature increases with momentum , resulting in a poorer fit . due to this the resolution",
    "then worsens as the input energy increases .",
    "in particular , muons in bins ii and iii exit the detector from the @xmath15-direction earlier than those in bins i and iv due to the larger @xmath14 dimension of the detector .",
    "hence , at higher energies , the resolutions in bins i and iv are better than those in bins ii and iii .    in contrast , at low energies , where the tracks are completely contained , muons in bins iii and iv with @xmath98 have negative @xmath14-component of momentum , and , as explained earlier , have better resolution than muons with the same @xmath99 but with @xmath100 as in bins i and ii .",
    "note however that roughly equal number of events are reconstructed in each @xmath42 bin .    at low momenta ,",
    "@xmath101 gev / c , when the track is completely contained , it is possible to determine the momentum purely from range measurements since the muon is a minimum ionising particle . while the results ( for the resolution @xmath68 ) are somewhat better than the fits obtained from the kalman filter technique , they are very unreliable at small angles because of the high probability of losses in detector dead spaces . hence , the use of range to determine the track momentum is limited and can be applied on a case - by - case basis , depending on the location of the track .",
    "however , we do not discuss this further here .    finally , the variation of resolution with @xmath102 for a range of @xmath41 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sv_e_ct_phi ] .",
    "+    in general , at angles larger than about @xmath103 ( @xmath64 ) , the resolution is relatively poor since there are several times fewer hits than at more vertical angles .",
    "this is a consequence of the detector geometry , with its horizontal layers of iron plates where energy is dominantly lost .",
    "hence ical is not so sensitive to very horizontal muons .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the other parameters of interest such as the mean shift , reconstruction effciency , etc .",
    "these are not very sensitive to the azimuthal angle ; hence , in what follows we combine all the @xmath42 bins and calculate @xmath42-averaged quantities .",
    "the mean of the reconstructed momentum ( @xmath49 ) distribution is approximately independent of both the polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "[ fig : meanshift ] shows the shift in the mean of reconstructed momentum @xmath104 , as a function of the input momentum . the shift can arise due to multiple scattering , etc . , and is roughly linear beyond a few gev / c .          the momentum reconstruction efficiency ( @xmath105 ) is defined as the ratio of the number of reconstructed events , @xmath106 ( irrespective of charge ) , to the total number of generated events , @xmath107 .",
    "we have @xmath108 fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the muon momentum reconstruction efficiency as a function of input momentum for different @xmath41 bins .",
    "the momentum reconstruction efficiency is somewhat smaller than the track reconstruction efficiency , especially at smaller angles .",
    "it is seen that the efficiency of momentum reconstruction depends on the energy of the incident particle , the strength of the magnetic field , the angle of propagation , etc .",
    "values.,scaledwidth=80.0%,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for momentum values below 4 gev / c as the input momentum increases , the reconstruction efficiency increases for all angles , since the number of hits increases as the particle crosses more number of layers . at larger angles ,",
    "the reconstruction efficiency for small energies is smaller compared to vertical angles since the number of hits for reconstructing tracks is less .",
    "but as the input energy increases , since the particle crosses more number of layers , the efficiency of reconstructing momentum also increases and becomes comparable with vertical angles .",
    "at higher energies the reconstruction efficiency becomes almost constant .",
    "the drop in efficiency at high energies for vertical muons is due to the track being partially contained as well as the requirement of single track being reconstructed .",
    "note that a similar figure in ref .",
    "@xcite does not include this requirement , and therefore corresponds to track reconstruction efficiency as defined in this paper .",
    "the charge identification of the particle plays a crucial role in the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy since it distinguishes neutrino from anti - neutrino induced events .",
    "the charge of the particle is determined from the direction of curvature of the track in the magnetic field .",
    "relative charge identification efficiency is defined as the ratio of number of events with correct charge identification , @xmath109 , to the total number of reconstructed events , i.e. , @xmath110 note that the total reconstructed events also includes those which are reconstructed in the wrong @xmath17 quadrant .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the relative charge identification efficiency as a function of input momentum for different polar angles @xmath41 .",
    "here we consider the number of reconstructed events after applying the additional selection criterion .",
    "a marginally worse charge identification efficiency is obtained for vertical events ( @xmath58 ) when this additional criterion is not applied , while results at other angles are virtually the same .",
    "note that the @xmath15-axis range is 0.871 and does not start from zero.,scaledwidth=80.0%,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the muon undergoes multiple scattering during propagation in the detector ; for small momentum , since the number of layers with hits is small , this may lead to an incorrectly reconstructed direction of bending , resulting in the wrong charge identification .",
    "hence the charge identification efficiency is relatively poor at lower energies , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "as the energy increases the length of the track also increases due to which the charge identification efficiency also improves . beyond a few gev / c ,",
    "the charge identification efficiency becomes roughly constant , about 9899% .",
    "while this is expected to hold up to @xmath111 gev / c or more , the momentum resolution at such high momenta will be much worse ; but this is outside the scope of the present study .",
    "the ical detector is proposed as the primary detector to be installed in the ino cavern , and its main goal is the study of neutrino oscillation parameters through atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the detector is mainly sensitive to charged - current events from interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with detector material ( mostly iron ) where muons are produced ( sometimes with additional hadrons as well ) , depending on the type and nature of the interaction .",
    "hence it is crucial to correctly understand the response of ical to muons by detailed simulations and this is the focus of this work .",
    "the ical geometry was simulated using geant4 software and muons with fixed momenta from 120 gev / c and and with direction @xmath112 were propagated through this simulated detector and their characteristics studied . in the current study , muons were generated in what is called the central part of the ical detector where the magnetic field is large and uniform . both contained and partially contained ( with muons exiting the detector ) events were analysed .",
    "it was found that clean tracks were obtained in the detector for muons with momenta from few to 10s of gev / c in all zenith angles smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "the momentum of the muons was reconstructed with the help of a kalman filter algorithm that makes use of the bending of the tracks in the magnetic field .",
    "hence the presence of the magnetic field is crucial to this study .",
    "different @xmath42 bins were analyzed separately in order to find the dependence of resolution on azimuthal angle .",
    "this was motivated by the presence of the magnetic field as well as the coil gaps and support structures that break the azimuthal symmetry , although neutrino oscillations as well as the neutrino flux ( at the relevant energies considered here ) are independent of @xmath42 , a strong east - west effect ( @xmath113 versus @xmath114 ) being visible @xcite only at sub - gev energies .",
    "each sample was analysed for the momentum resolution , reconstruction efficiency , charge identification efficiency and direction resolution .",
    "while the momentum resolution was about 914% , the momentum reconstruction efficiency was better than about 80% in most of the regions .",
    "the direction resolution was found to be indeed very good , being better than a degree for all angles for momenta greater than about 4 gev / c , which is most important for studying the neutrino mass hierarchy through matter effects .",
    "the relative charge identification efficiency was also about 98% over this range .    in summary ,",
    "ical simulations indicate that the detector has a good response to muons , including identifying their momentum , direction , and charge , with good efficiency .",
    "these results have already been used to perform the physics analysis of atmospheric neutrinos with ical @xcite , @xcite and are now being used in many other physics analyses .",

    "the filter iteratively shrinks the error in the estimates by processing the input hits , one after another .",
    "the process converges very well once at least 5 hits are passed to the fitter program .",
    "the dead spaces , namely the coil gap and the support structures that have no active detector elements , are more or less uniformly distributed throughout ical . in order to understand the impact of these on the detector resolution",
