    "a major goal of proteomics is to determine structures of proteins rapidly .",
    "it is impractical to obtain very high resolution structures on a genome wide scale .",
    "furthermore , for processing biological functions it is important to characterize the dynamics and thermodynamics of a network of proteins . from a computational perspective",
    ", it is currently impossible to realize these goals using all - atom molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . thus , there is an urgent need to develop coarse - grained , yet reliable , models for protein structures .",
    "construction of such models requires the determination of interaction potentials between amino acid residues .",
    "the wealth of structural data on a number of proteins in the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite has been a source for obtaining interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "the idea of using the frequencies of amino acid pairing to determine potential interaction parameters was first proposed by tanaka and scheraga @xcite . with the exception of a few studies @xcite ,",
    "most of the `` knowledge - based '' potentials have been obtained solely in terms of residue - residue contacts .",
    "sippl @xcite and others have introduced an explicit distance dependence in the database - derived mean force potentials using the boltzmann formula .",
    "this method , known as the `` boltzmann device '' , assumes that the known protein structures from the pdb correspond to classical equilibrium states .",
    "the side chain - side chain ( sc - sc ) potentials can be related to distance - dependent probability densities @xmath2 by the relation @xmath3 \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the probability density for a side chain of type @xmath5 to be separated by a distance @xmath6 from a side chain of type @xmath7 , and the choice of the reference probability density @xmath8 is very important @xcite .",
    "sippl @xcite suggests that @xmath6 can be the distance between two atoms or some other structural parameter such as dihedral angles .",
    "other statistical potentials developed subsequently using this approach have interpreted @xmath2 as the distance - dependent probability density .    in recent years",
    ", a number of studies have evaluated the goodness of statistical potentials based on pairwise additive interactions between residues @xcite .",
    "these studies have concluded that pairwise additive potentials , dependent only on the radial distance between residues , are inadequate for structure prediction .",
    "one of the major drawbacks of using contact potentials or potentials that only depend on the radial distance is that the relative orientation between the amino acids , which plays a role in the packing of the protein interior , is not taken into account . to account for the dense interior of the folded states of proteins it is crucial to optimize the relative orientation of the participating side chains @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to examine the relevance of interaction potentials between amino acids that include the orientational dependence .    by analyzing the angular distribution of side chains around amino acids , bahar and",
    "jernigan @xcite showed that some residue pairs have specific coordination states with much higher probabilities than those expected from random distributions .",
    "another indication that the relative residue - residue orientations are important is the recent success of the united - residue force field ( unres ) developed by scheraga and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the sc - sc interactions of the unres potentials are parameterized as van der waals potentials with a pair - specific angular dependence included in the well depth .",
    "the unres potentials employ a generalized gay - berne potential @xcite that assumes that the interacting sites are ellipsoids of revolution placed at the center of mass of the side chains .",
    "although the relative side chain orientations are described in a simplified manner , the success of the unres potentials demonstrates the importance of including orientational dependence in the side chain interaction potential .",
    "this idea is also supported by recent studies of protein side chain packing @xcite which found that current potentials can accommodate more than one rotamer for 95% of side chain positions .",
    "these studies suggest that interaction potentials that can discriminate between a large number of competing rotamer states are required .",
    "the main goals of this paper are ( a ) to extract statistical information about the relative residue - residue orientations and distances in proteins using the available high resolution pdb structures and ( b ) to investigate the utility of the orientational information in enhancing the ability of distance dependent potentials to identify native protein folds .",
    "these goals can contribute to a better understanding of the specific residue packing of native protein structures .",
    "motivated by the above mentioned results of jernigan et al .",
    "@xcite and scheraga et al .",
    "@xcite , we approached the first goal by defining local reference frames ( lrfs ) that permit a more precise , quantitative description of the relative orientation of a given pair of side chains .",
    "the new lrfs are related more closely to the three - dimensional configuration of the individual side chains , rather than to their relative position with respect to the backbone or to the neighboring residues .",
    "we could extract thus novel radial and angular dependent inter - residue statistical potentials that reflect the specific distributions of distances and relative sc - sc orientations as observed in native structures of real proteins . in order to address our second goal we tested the efficacy of the new potentials by using a large database of incorrect models of real proteins @xcite , known as decoys .",
    "these decoys are computer - generated models of protein structures , specifically designed for being used in evaluating the capacity of various potential functions to distinguish the native - like conformations from non - native ones .    before presenting our methods and the results that we obtained ,",
    "a few clarifications are necessary .",
    "first , a complete set of potentials for coarse - grained protein folding simulations should take into account interactions between side chains , interactions between side chains and peptide groups , and energetics dependent on torsional angles that define the backbone structure @xcite .",
    "we only investigate the specific features of sc - sc interactions , as has been done before in studies of statistical potentials that are only contact or distance dependent .",
    "secondly , we constructed our own corresponding set of distance - dependent potentials rather than employing potentials constructed by other authors . in this manner we minimized the possibility that a better parameter fitting , specific computational implementation , or other technical aspects could affect our results .",
    "finally , as in similar studies @xcite we do not directly address the issue of the dependence of the results on the training database size or sampling problems .",
    "instead , we used a standard , reproducible approach , by employing the set of non - homologous proteins that was used by scheraga et al .",
    "@xcite for similar purposes .",
    "the relative residue - residue orientations are thought to be directly related to the nature of the forces that shape the specific three - dimensional structures of proteins @xcite .",
    "however , a quantitative approach to the statistical extraction of these orientational information from high resolution structures is still needed .",
    "the necessity of including orientation dependent interactions is established in section [ sec : oops ] by computing correlation functions that probe orientational order in the pdb structures .",
    "it is shown that , for a given native state topology , the orientational packing of side chains may be decomposed into a linear combination of simple cluster geometries . however , the use of simple orientational order parameters is _ not sufficient _ for discriminating between basic protein architectures such as @xmath0-helix or @xmath1-sheet . as such",
    ", we are motivated to use more detailed quantitative descriptions of relative residue orientations . in order to achieve this goal , in section",
    "[ sec : lrfs ] we introduce definitions of amino acid dependent local reference frames ( lrfs ) that permit a standard description of the relative sc - sc orientations .",
    "a method for extracting the radial and angular dependent pair distribution functions is presented in section [ sec : pot ] , emphasizing the limits imposed on the statistical analysis by the accuracy of the available experimental database of protein structures .",
    "the specificity of sc - sc contacts suggests that the relative residue orientations should play a significant role in determining packing in proteins .",
    "this idea , supported by the study of bahar and jernigan @xcite , builds up on the more general theme of how side chains pack in the native states of proteins @xcite .",
    "the observation that the interior of protein structures is densely packed @xcite raises the question if one can use a simple crystal lattice description ( e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . ) for the side chain packing .",
    "while there are many qualitative descriptions of residue packing , they are mainly based on the notion that hydrophobic interactions are responsible for globular shapes @xcite and that specific polar interactions and hydrogen bonding are important stabilizing factors .",
    "because these studies do not address quantitatively the issue of relative side chain orientations , we used orientational order parameters ( oops ) @xcite to asses their importance .",
    "the orientational order parameters ( oops ) were introduced @xcite to analyze the internal structure of liquids and glasses and have been used as reaction coordinates for studying the structure of a nucleating system @xcite .",
    "the oops are defined in terms of `` bonds '' that connect a central particle to its neighbors . for each `` bond ''",
    ", one can compute the corresponding values of the spherical harmonic functions @xmath11 that can be used as _ local order _",
    "parameters @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the position vector of the central particle and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the polar and azimuthal angles of vector @xmath13 with respect to any reference frame ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . to make the @xmath16 values representative for describing the orientational order of an entire system of particles , the _ global _ orientational parameters are defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of bonds in the system .    both @xmath16 and @xmath19",
    "depend on the choice of local reference frame in which the @xmath20 values are calculated .",
    "second- and third - order rotationally invariant combinations can be constructed using @xmath21 and @xmath22 where the term @xmath23 is the wigner-3j symbol @xcite . in liquids ,",
    "the ratio @xmath24 is not sensitive to the exact definition of neighboring bonds of a particle .",
    "the orientational order parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , together with the reduced order parameter @xmath27 have specific values for a number of simple cluster geometries such as face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) , hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) , body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) , simple cubic ( sc ) and icosahedral ( icos ) .",
    "if only the spherical term ( @xmath28 ) dominates , then it is clear that orientational potentials are not expected to be important .",
    "the emergence of non - zero values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 not only signify that side chain orientations are important in dense packing but may also point to the nature of orientational ordering .",
    "all the low - order values ( @xmath29 ) of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are sensitive to the structural details that are specific to the simple cluster geometries mentioned above @xcite",
    ". however , for practical reasons , monitoring the values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 suffices to discriminate between the different cluster geometries @xcite .",
    "the values of these four oops ( fig . [ fig : qlms]a ) serve as a reference to which the values computed using pdb structures can be compared .     * ( a ) * the values of the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 orientational order parameters for simple cluster geometries @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were multiplied by 10 . ]    due to scale differences between @xmath25 and @xmath27 , the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were multiplied by 10 .",
    "we calculated the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 parameters ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qlms]b ) for three sets of 50 proteins from the same family with @xmath0-helical and @xmath1-strand architectures listed in table [ tab : table1 ] . for each set , we have specifically selected homologue structures to maximize the possibility of finding oops that have different , characteristic values for different protein architectures .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] the three sets of protein structures used to investigate if a simple packing description is appropriate for protein residues .",
    "highly homologue sequences corresponding to alpha and beta architectures were specifically selected . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the type of protein architecture and the number of residues are also factors that could influence the relative performance of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 potentials . a useful quantitative parameter that is directly related to the type of protein architecture is the contact order ( co ) @xcite of a protein structure .",
    "the co definition employed here is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of contacts and @xmath38 is the sequence separation , in residues , between contacting residues @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "two residues are considered to be in contact when @xmath39 and any of the heavy atoms of residue @xmath5 is within 3.75   of any of the heavy atoms of residue @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "when the co is small the protein structure presents mostly local contacts ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , and when co is larger , the contacts are nonlocal @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zer - fit]a we observed an inverse proportionality between the co values calculated for all the native states of the decoys analyzed in this paper and the fraction of local contacts for various protein architectures . based on this observation",
    ", we investigated the relative performance of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 potentials as a function of co values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zer - fit]b ) and sequence length ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zer - fit]c ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : zer - fit]b and [ fig : zer - fit]c is shown the dependence of the difference @xmath41 for the energy z - scores on contact order values ( co ) and sequence length of the native state ( n ) .",
    "negative @xmath42 values correspond to better performing scores for the distance- and orientation - dependent potentials ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the lines represent linear fits .",
    "while the trends are not very strong , it is observed that , for the energy z - scores the novel @xmath34 statistical potentials perform better then the @xmath43 potentials for longer proteins , presenting large contact orders , such as the @xmath1-sheet structures from the `` ig_structal '' and `` ig_structal_hires '' sets .",
    "it is observed that the inclusion of the information on relative sc - sc orientations makes the current version of the @xmath34 statistical potentials more useful than @xmath43 for relatively large , globular proteins ( @xmath44 residues ) , with a significant content of @xmath1-sheet structure and nonlocal contacts . at the same time",
    ", it is also observed that even for relatively short ( @xmath45 residues ) and @xmath0-helical proteins ( low co values ) , both the @xmath46 and @xmath47-scores can be improved when using @xmath34 potentials but for a smaller number of cases .",
    "these results suggest that details about side chain - backbone interactions should be included in statistical potentials for short or @xmath0-helical proteins with a high content of local contacts .",
    "our results demonstrate that it is possible to improve the performance of energy based scoring functions by using statistical information extracted from the relative residue - residue orientations",
    ". calculations of orientational order parameters for investigating the residue packing in proteins showed that architecture dependent packing is best described by a linear combination of simple cluster geometries ( fcc , icos , hcp and bcc ) .",
    "this result reinforces the need for extracting orientation dependent potentials using pdb structures .",
    "we have defined a novel local reference system for each residue for quantitatively describing the relative three - dimensional orientations in a manner that is independent of the neighboring amino acids .",
    "arguments based on experimental resolution of protein structures were used to derive the optimal bin size employed for collecting statistical data with both angular and distance dependence .",
    "the orientational information has both common and complementary significance as compared to the information that can be extracted from the relative residue - residue distances alone .",
    "the tests that we performed on a standard data base of artificially generated decoy structures suggest that this complementarity can be very important for a large class of protein structures .",
    "the novel distance and orientation dependent statistical potentials were shown to present an enhanced ability to recognize native - like protein folds , especially for larger structures with high contact orders ( e.g. immunoglobulins ) .",
    "they should find use in constructing the next generation of coarse grained off - lattice protein simulations .",
    "these new potentials could also be instrumental in developing more efficient computational methods for structure prediction on much larger scales than it is currently possible , addressing one of the major goals of proteomics . to achieve this",

    "it is important , therefore , to identify the minimal radial and angular bin sizes that ensure a certain high level of confidence that the information has been analyzed correctly and that no important artifacts due to the limitations of the experimental methods have been overlooked . in building a statistical distribution , the data that is collected from protein structures @xcite consists of inter - atomic distances . we expect that such data has an accuracy of @xmath50 .    for the radial dependence of the data ,",

    "we estimate that the probability of correct radial assignment depends on the bin size @xmath51 and the accuracy @xmath55 as @xmath56 this estimate is based on the assumption that the probability of correct assignment to a certain bin of a certain pair distance value is directly proportional to the difference @xmath57 between that value and the nearest bin boundary , or that @xmath58 . using the above assumed conditions for the values of @xmath59 at the bin middle and on the boundary , we find that @xmath60 therefore , for the average probability of correct assignment we find that @xmath61 from this result we can infer that for @xmath62 , if we choose a radial bin size @xmath63 , the confidence of correct bin assignment is about 65.6% . in this work",

    "the solid angle corresponding to one angular bin is @xmath71 .",
    "this solid angle is proportional to the ratio between the area element that insures a certain high value for the confidence level of correct assignment , and the square of the corresponding minimum pair distance ( radius ) at which we expect that confidence level .",
    "let us require a confidence level of 80% at a distance of 5 . at larger distances",
    "the confidence level will be higher , but it will decrease at closer ranges . since @xmath72 , and @xmath64 , @xmath73  and @xmath62 , we have @xmath74 . this reasoning leads us to employ the nearest even value of @xmath75 for the number of bins that divide the angular interval for @xmath67 .",
    "previous studies @xcite used a smaller value ( @xmath76 ) .    the use of a larger radial bin size ( 1.2  vs. 0.5 ) than previously suggested , is needed to ensure a high confidence level ( at least 83.3% ) of correct radial bin assignment . here",
    ", we employ twenty radial distance bins with @xmath64  for distances starting at @xmath77 .",
    "when we collect statistical data on the relative 3-dimensional orientation of pairs of residues , we obtain a similarly high confidence level by using @xmath75 for @xmath67 and @xmath78 for @xmath68 .",
    "all the calculations presented in this section are based on the assumption that all protein structures analyzed have a resolution of 2  or better .",
    "if proteins of different structural resolution are analyzed , the optimal bin size can be estimated accordingly .",
