    "coherence among an ensemble of atoms or molecules mediated by radiation fields has shown a variety of remarkable phenomena , and has offered a platform of devising new tools and/or methods .",
    "one classical example of such coherence is super - radiance@xcite@xcite . in this case , excited atoms or molecules organize themselves into a coherent state via a series of spontaneous emission , eventually resulting in explosive radiation pulses .",
    "another example is the adiabatic raman process studied by ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this case , the coherence is used to generate a series of equally - spaced sidebands which in turn enables one to create ultra - short pulses .",
    "recently , some of the authors have proposed to use a new type of coherent amplification mechanism in order to study experimentally much suppressed processes involving neutrinos @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of the proposal is to investigate unknown neutrino properties such as their absolute masses , mass type ( dirac or majorana ) , and cp - violating phases@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this amplification by coherence , termed as macro - coherent amplification , is applicable to a process which emits plural particles .",
    "if outgoing particles satisfy a certain phase matching condition , equivalent to the momentum conservation law , then the process rate becomes proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of coherent atoms or molecules involved in the process .",
    "when the macro - coherent amplification is applied to two - photon emission process , a pair of intense radiations may emerge in a similar fashion to the triggered super - radiance@xcite .",
    "such a process , called paired super - radiance ( psr in short ) , has been predicted , and its master equations have been derived @xcite@xcite . in an ideal situation ,",
    "most of the energy stored in an upper level may be released in an explosive way .",
    "the theory of psr also predicts much milder events in which the degree of coherence , target number density , decoherence time , or a combination of these is less favorable than the explosive one .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an experiment which was conducted to explore the macro - coherent amplification mechanism using the two - photon emission process from electronically - ground vibrationally - excited state ( @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ) of hydrogen molecules .",
    "( for brevity the word  hydrogen \" may be used for hydrogen molecule below . )",
    "figure [ fig : h2 energy levels ] shows the hydrogen energy levels relevant to the present experiment . to prepare the initial states , we employed an adiabatic raman method changing the hydrogen from its ground ( @xmath4 ) state to the superposed state of @xmath5 and @xmath2 by a pair of driving lasers ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 in fig.[fig : h2 energy levels ] ) . since the electric dipole ( e1 ) transition",
    "is strictly forbidden from electronically - ground vibrationally - excited states of homo - nuclear diatomic molecules , deexcitation from @xmath3 is via the two - photon emission whose spontaneous rate is very small .",
    "two - photon emissions ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 in fig.[fig : h2 energy levels ] ) together with other raman sidebands were detected in the present experiment , and their yields were compared with the theoretical expectations .    in the present work ,",
    "the two driving lasers were injected in the same direction , and one of the generated sidebands was used as a trigger field .",
    "this experimental configuration has been discussed in the literature @xcite in the context of the parametric down conversion .",
    "our experimental results may be understood from its view point ; however , we employ a different approach in explanations below , namely the view point of the adiabatic raman excitation supplemented by the paired super - radiance@xcite .",
    "the basic equation ( maxwell - bloch ) presented below is derived from this view point@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe theoretical aspects of the paired super - radiance and adiabatic raman process , and present a simulation method based on an effective hamiltonian combined for both .",
    "they are non - linear processes and thus demand numerical simulations to obtain various observables which can be compared directly with actual experimental data .",
    "following these , we describe our experimental setup in sec.3 .",
    "the results and conclusions are given in sec.4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we begin our discussion by constructing an effective hamiltonian which describes both two - photon emission and raman excitation processes .",

    "many intermediate levels may contribute , as shown in fig .",

    "the present system can be regarded as a two level system once the intermediate state @xmath15 is integrated out from the schrdinger equation with the aid of the markov approximation .",
    "the electromagnetic fields to be considered are the two driving lasers and the associated raman sidebands with frequencies of @xmath16 where the raman order @xmath17 is a positive ( anti - stokes ) or negative ( stokes ) integer satisfying @xmath18 . in the present experimental conditions ,",
    "the smallest @xmath17 ( the lowest stokes sideband ) is @xmath19 .",
    "the frequency difference of the two driving lasers @xmath20 should be chosen to be nearly on resonance ; the difference between the exact resonance frequency @xmath21 and @xmath20 is the detuning @xmath22 .",
    "in addition to these sidebands , there should be the fields corresponding to the two - photon emissions .",
    "the frequencies of the pair are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 which should satisfy the energy conservation law of @xmath23 since the raman excitation imprints a spatially dependent phase of @xmath24 in medium , eq.([two - photon cascade frequency ] ) satisfies the momentum conservation law if the two - photon fields propagate in the same direction as the excitation fields , and the dispersion in the medium is negligible for these wavelengths .",
    "the macro - coherent amplification mechanism requires the momentum conservation as well as the energy conservation of elementary process .",

    "the polarization @xmath48 can be calculated with @xmath50 .",
    "putting @xmath48 into eq.([maxwell wave equation ] ) with the help of rwa and svea , we arrive at a set of equations , referred to as maxwell - bloch equation , expressed by @xmath51 here we have introduced the co - moving coordinates defined by @xmath52 , and the rabi frequencies by @xmath53 relaxation terms in bloch eqs.([bloch - gg]-[bloch - ge ] ) , given by the terms proportional to @xmath54 ( longitudinal ) and @xmath55 ( transverse ) , are the most general form in the two - level system .",

    "these powers , corresponding to the two driving lasers ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , should be excluded from the @xmath110 sum because they may contain ineffective ones ( non - overlapping part ) .",
    "the monochromator efficiency depends on the spot size and angular divergence of input lights and/or grating efficiency which in turn depends on the wavelength .",

    "<S> in this paper , we describe an experiment which was conducted to explore the macro - coherent amplification mechanism using a two - photon emission process from the first vibrationally - excited state of para - hydrogen molecule . </S>",
    "<S> large coherence in the initial state was prepared by the adiabatic raman method , and the lowest stokes sideband was used as a trigger field . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the coherent two - photon emission consistent with the expectation of the maxwell - bloch equation derived for the process , whose rate is larger by many orders of magnitude than that of the spontaneous emission . </S>"
