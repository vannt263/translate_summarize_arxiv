    "the origin of our solar system remains to be one of the most exciting problems of today s astronomy . for a long time",
    "it has been the only known planetary system .",
    "while it is still the only planetary system that can be studied in detail , progress in observation techniques has led to the discovery of extrasolar planets and even some extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "the wealth of observational data raised the question of how a planetary system forms in general .",
    "as of writing these lines , 859 planets and 676 planetary systems are known .",
    "most of these planetary systems are very different compared to our solar system .",
    "understanding planet formation comprises many challenges , such as hydrodynamics of the protoplanetary disc , chemical evolution of the embedded dust grains , migration of planets and planetesimals and even star - star interactions in dense young star clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review and references therein , and also the introduction of paper i , for a brief summary ) .",
    "all these components constitute the frame for the essential process of planet formation : an enormous growth from dust - sized particles to the final planets , accompanied by a steady decrease of the number of particles which contain most of the mass over many orders of magnitude .",
    "the particle number changes over many orders of magnitude as planetary growth proceeds .",
    "there is active research on each of the different aspects of planet formation , but the current efforts are far from a unified model of planet formation @xcite .",
    "we address the study of this many  to  few transition from planetesimals to few protoplanets .",
    "this stage is of particular interest , as it links the early planetesimal formation to the final planet formation .",
    "collisions still play a major role in the evolution of the system , and the close interplay between the change of the size distribution and the evolution of the random velocities requires a careful treatment of the complete size range .    small @xmath0body simulations ( i.e. with less than few @xmath1 particles ) have been useful in exploring the basic growth mechanisms at the price of a modified timescale and an artificially reduced particle number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "statistical codes explored the limit of large particle numbers in the early phases and are now tentatively applied to the full planet formation process .",
    "an efficient solution would be the combination of these two approaches in one hybrid code to unify the advantages of both methods .    in this work",
    ", we present a series of tests and first results of our new hybrid code , which was presented in paper i. as described in the first paper , it combines the nbody6 code ( a descendant of the widespread @xmath0body family ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a new statistical code which uses recent works on the statistical description of planetesimal systems .",
    "the new hybrid code includes a consistent modelling of the velocity distribution and the mass spectrum over the whole range of relevant sizes , which allows us to apply a detailed collision model rather than the perfect - merger assumption used in previous @xmath0body simulations .",
    "we then apply this new code to follow the formation of protoplanets out of 110 km sized planetesimals . in section  [ sec.validation ]",
    "we present a series of tests that check for the rubustness of the code . in section  [ sec.ics ]",
    "we explain the initial conditions we use for our numerical experiments , which we show in section  [ sec.simulations ] . in section  [ sec.mill ]",
    "we derive a useful relation that allows us to introduce an universal upper limit of the protoplanetary mass as a function of the distance to the host star .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec.discussion ] we discuss our progress and results and potential future applications .",
    "the new hybrid code requires the implementation of rather different methods within a single framework .",
    "we have here two possible sources of problems .",
    "first , the method is new and therefore it must be carefully assessed with other work ; on the other hand , the implementation must also be checked meticulously , since it combines two rather different approaches .",
    "we hence present in this section a number of tests to check all code components , namely the evolution of the velocity dispersion , the accuracy of the solver of the coagulation equation , the proper joining of statistical and @xmath0body component and an overall comparison of statistical , @xmath0body and hybrid calculations .",
    "table  [ simdata ] summarises the selected test runs with the respective initial conditions .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now examine the evolution of different surface densities with a last set of simulations .",
    "we take s1fb as our nominal model , with a a surface density of @xmath2 g@xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "we explore two different surface densities : a low  mass disc with @xmath5 g@xmath3@xmath4 ( simulation s8_s2 ) , and a high  mass disc with @xmath6 g@xmath3@xmath4 ( simulation s9_s100 ) , which is close to the upper mass limit set by observations .",
    "the basic parameters of all three simulations are equal except a proper scaling of the gas density and transition masses chosen individually .",
    "we first resume the inspection of possibly emerging gaps : while the low mass case shows a more pronounced radial structure ( with fluctuations as large as 40% ) , these features are only weakly related to the location of the largest protoplanets .",
    "hence , these structures are signatures of the first emerging @xmath0body particles .",
    "the high mass case exhibits no strong features at all , except for very weak features during the initial runaway phase .",
    "these results strengthen the discussion in section  [ spatdist ] , assigning only a minor role to gap formation in the planetesimal component during the protoplanet accretion .",
    "the overall growth process follows a standard pattern . since the accretion rate in all three simulations is directly proportional to the surface density ( see the following equation of section `` protoplanet growth '' of paper i ) , we rescale the time to the reference simulation s1fb .",
    "we obtain a good agreement in the time evolution of the largest mass in the system , as we can see in figure  [ mmax_sig ] , although the turnover to the slower oligarchic growth occurs at different ( scaled ) times .",
    "likewise , we rescale the time to ease the comparison of the mass loss in the three simulations , which we depict in figure  [ mloss_sig ] .    as soon as a set of dominant protoplanets has evolved , they control the velocity dispersion of the field planetesimals",
    ". therefore the magnitude of the velocity dispersion matches the hill velocity of the largest body in the system ( see table  [ propmax ] and figure  [ s_benz ] , [ s_sig2 ] and [ s_sig100 ] ) .",
    "while this similarity in the three simulations is also in good agreement with standard estimations of the growth process ( see the section `` initial models '' of paper i ) , the later stages in the evolution differ markedly : a larger surface density implies larger ( and faster growing ) protoplanets , so that the velocity dispersion of the field planetesimals is also driven to higher velocities .",
    "this therefore leads to an increased mass loss as the initial surface density increases ( figure  [ mloss_sig ] ) .",
    "the mass loss of the most massive setup s9_s100 reduces the surface density nearly to the standard case s1fb .",
    "since the mass loss is not due to actual migration of smaller fragments , but to the lower grid boundary ( in mass ) which mimics the effect of migration , this effect deserves a closer examination :    the influence of fragmentation on the protoplanetary growth is mainly determined by two timescales : the fragmentation time , @xmath7 , which refers to collisions between planetesimals , and the growth timescale @xmath8 of the protoplanetary accretion .",
    "we employ the expressions derived in section `` perturbation of equilibrium '' of paper i and the approximated differential surface density of equation  [ apreqsig ] to estimate the fragmentation time :    @xmath9    in the last equation @xmath10 is a typical mass of the largest planetesimals , @xmath11 is the corresponding radius and @xmath12 is the impact strength .",
    "@xmath13 is the total surface density of the field planetesimals , with a lower cut - off @xmath14 due to migration .",
    "@xmath15 is the typical hill radius of a protoplanet , where it is assumed that the protoplanets control the velocity dispersion of the field planetesimals .",
    "the growth timescale of the protoplanets follows immediately from rearranging the following equation , as discussed in section `` protoplanet growth '' of paper i :    @xmath16    the timescale hence is    @xmath17    since the mass loss due to migration and the replenishment of smaller fragments by mutual collisions quickly establishes a stationary solution , the removal of the field planetesimals operates on the fragmentation timescale .",
    "since the protoplanets grind the surrounding planetesimals without retaining a significant fraction , the accretion of the protoplanet ceases if the condition    @xmath18    is fulfilled , which we will refer to from now onwards as the `` mill condition '' .",
    "we can easily derive a lower limit for the protoplanet mass assuming @xmath19 and by translating this condition in terms of mass , the `` mill mass '' ,    @xmath20{\\frac{m_c}{a^3\\rho}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which we denote as @xmath21 :    @xmath22    in the last expression @xmath23 is the bulk density of the planetesimals and @xmath24 is the escape velocity of the field planetesimals .",
    "@xmath25 is a factor of order unity to take into account alternative treatments of migration that could alter the size of @xmath21 .",
    "we note that a necessary condition for the mill process to operate is the presence of a gaseous disc .",
    "since a high surface density is needed for the protoplanetary growth to reach the mill mass , the growth itself is likely to be faster than the dispersal of the gaseous disc .",
    "nevertheless , the concept is also useful in a gas - free system : if the protoplanets in a given planetary system do not exceed the mill mass , it is still possible that the planets after the final giant impact phase exceed @xmath21 .",
    "radiative pressure and pointing  robertson drag still provide an effective removal of dust - sized particles in a gas - free system ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; hence , while the absence of strong migration of planetesimals prevents any reduction of the planetary accretion rate , the system enters nevertheless a qualitatively different stage : the evolution of the left - over planetesimals ( i.e. the _ disc clearing _ ) is now driven by fragmentation rather than accretion .",
    "the mill mass is that _ is independent of the surface density of the field planetesimals and hence represents a universal upper limit of the protoplanet mass _ , given that all other parameters of the planetary system are fixed .",
    "the mill mass increases more steeply with radius ( @xmath26 ) than the isolation mass for any realistic density profiles ( e.g. @xmath27 for the minimum mass solar nebula ) .",
    "this restricts the efficient termination of accretion by fragmentation to the inner parts e.g . the terrestrial zone in the solar system of a planetary system .",
    "the migration process enters only through the lower cut - off mass @xmath14 .",
    "while the uncertainty of @xmath14 in principle is not a big issue , as it appears in the logarithm , the truth is that the migration timescale depends on the planetesimal radius which can vary significantly .",
    "an uncertainty of the cut - off radius by a factor of ten indicates an uncertainty of @xmath21 of the same order , which again leads us to the question about the necessity of a careful treatment of migration in a global frame .",
    "all simulations use a lower cut - off size of @xmath28 metres , which is roughly equivalent to the cut - off introduced by migration . since @xmath14 is defined by the identity of the migration timescale and the fragmentation timescale ( see section `` collisional cascades '' of paper i ) , this mass is also independent of the surface density , given that the ratio of solid to gaseous material is constant .",
    "while the more refined simulation s6fbh shows a mass loss only reduced by 30% , we expect that the uncertainty due to the reduced treatment of migration to be at least of the same order .    in view of these considerations , we retake now the analysis of the simulations : simulation s9_s100 is strongly affected by the mill process , whereas simulation s1fb still retains a significant fraction of the initial mass .",
    "the quiescent conditions in simulation s8_s2 exclude a prominent role of fragmentation at any evolutionary stage .",
    "thus we estimate @xmath29 for a solar system analogue at 1 au ( see figure  [ mmax_sig ] ) , which yields the approximate expressions :    @xmath30    since the protoplanets maintain a separation of approximately @xmath31 , the mill mass corresponds to an upper limit @xmath32 of the surface density which is available for the formation of protoplanets :    @xmath33    the scaling relation  [ mmillscale ] implies @xmath34 at 5 au , which is in agreement with an upper core mass of @xmath35 found in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "although it seems impossible to form a core that is large enough ( @xmath36 ) to initiate gas accretion , this tight upper limit is due to disregarding the gaseous envelope i.e . the protoplanetary atmosphere before the onset of strong gas accretion of the growing core .",
    "since the gaseous envelope enhances the accretion cross section by an order of magnitude ( and hence @xmath37 in equation  [ mmillscale ] ) , the mill mass increases by the same factor .",
    "thus the formation of a @xmath36 proto - jovian core at 5 au is not ruled out by fragmentation , again in agreement with @xcite .",
    "both low  mass simulations s1fb and s8_s2 still contain a major fraction of the total mass in the statistical component , which prevents the onset of orbital crossing on a timescale of a few @xmath38 years",
    ". however , the fast protoplanetary growth in the high  mass simulation s9_s100 , accompanied by an intense mass loss , leads to an onset of strong protoplanet ",
    "protoplanet interactions already at the end of the simulation .",
    "the chaotic evolution of the velocity dispersion at the high mass end , as we can see in figure  [ s_sig100 ] bottom , indicates an intense interaction of the @xmath0body particles .",
    "in this article , which can be envisaged as a continuation of the work we presented in paper i , we first carefully assess the code and then apply it to investigate the formation of protoplanets .",
    "our main results are summarised as follows    1 .",
    "the influence of the fragmentation model on the protoplanetary growth is weak during the fast initial runaway growth . in particular , any realistic choice of the impact strength",
    "does not inhibit the growth of the planetesimals .",
    "however , the choice of the fragmentation model controls the oligarchic growth through the overall mass loss due to the migration of smaller fragments .",
    "our simulations show that the @xcite strength leads to a significant deceleration of the mass accretion in the later phases .",
    "thus the recent impact strength from @xcite is more favourable in terms of an efficient protoplanet formation .",
    "we derive the notion of a critical _ mill mass _ to provide a convenient handle on the fragmentation processes . if the mass of a ( proto)planet exceeds this critical limit , then an interplay of destructive collisions and the removal of fragments by migration terminates the accretion of planetesimals .",
    "in particular , this critical mass implies an upper limit of the mass ( in solids ) , which can be transformed into planets , unless migration ceases very early due to the fast dissipation of the gaseous disc .",
    "contrary to the work of @xcite , we find no termination of the protoplanetary accretion due to gap formation .",
    "none of our simulations shows any significant radial structure , except for a limited time during the runaway accretion . while low surface densities favour gap formation , all observed radial features are so weak that the notion `` gap '' does not correspond to these structures .",
    "hence , resonant interactions between protoplanets and the field planetesimals are not a dominant process during the growth phases considered , which also supports the validity of the fokker ",
    "planck approach .",
    "likewise , the dynamically hot field planetesimals also suppress non - axisymmetric features beyond the hill radius of the protoplanets .",
    "we must mention that the difference we find with @xcite is true for a _ hot _ disc .",
    "nevertheless , his solution is correct in some cases , especially when the disc can remain cold ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as in , for instance , the gaps of saturn s rings ( e.g. the work of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the eccentricity and inclination of the protoplanets remain small during the oligarchic growth phase .",
    "however , we note that this does not imply small eccentricities of the final planets , since the onset of orbital crossing terminates the dynamically quiet oligarchic growth phase .    since our work introduced a new computer code to study the growth of protoplanets , we primarily focussed on the careful assessment of its validity and a small parameter study to strengthen this approach .",
    "considering that the current abilities of the hybrid code exclude global simulation which could address migration in a proper way , we restricted our studies to a small ring of planetesimals .",
    "however , our experience drawn from this work allows an outline of possible improvements .",
    "the wallclock time of a rather small simulation is dominated by the integration of the statistical component . as the radial extension of the simulation volume",
    "is increased , the computing time due to the statistical component increases linearly , whereas the computing time due to the @xmath0body component increases proportional to the square of the radial width .",
    "if the resolution of the radial grid is reduced , the weight of the @xmath0body part will further increase . a moderately extended model , which covers the inner planetary system up to 10 au , requires the long - term integration of @xmath39 to @xmath1 particles .",
    "while these are only few particles compared to big star cluster simulations ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the long integration times of at least @xmath40 orbits prevent the efficient parallelisation .",
    "astrophysicists had an early start in the field of through the grape hardware in a standard pc cluster ( see the extensive description in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a more promising solution are the modern graphics processing units ( gpus ) , which have made significant progress in the last years . they were originally used to perform calculations related to 3d computer graphics .",
    "nevertheless , due to their highly parallel structure and computational speed , they can be very efficiently used for complex algorithms .",
    "computational astrophysics has been a pioneer to use gpus for high performance general purpose computing ( see for example the early astrogpu workshop in princeton 2007 , through the information base ) .",
    "the direct @xmath0body code has been ported to gpus by sverre aarseth who , as is his admirable custom , has made the code publicly available .",
    "we plan on porting our hybrid method to gpu technology soon .",
    "the extension of the simulations towards longer integration times does not only require an optimisation of the hybrid code , but also a more careful modelling of the growing planets to account for the interaction with the gaseous disc .",
    "while these improvements are necessary to allow the consistent treatment of migration , they also open the study of the early debris disc phase .",
    "debris discs could provide constraints on the planet formation process , since the low opacity of kilometre - sized planetesimals prevents the direct observation of the protoplanetary growth in extrasolar systems .",
    "though all these improvements are not implemented yet , they encourage us to pursue the further development of the hybrid approach .",
