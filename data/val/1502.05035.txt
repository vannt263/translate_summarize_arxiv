    "in addition , the high precision photometry ( @xmath4 over 6-hour timescales for the brightest ( @xmath5 ) dwarfs , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) enables studies of giant exoplanets and a wide variety of variable stars .",
    "its photometric band @xmath6 covers 423 - 897 nm and is similar to , but broader than , a combined @xmath7 and @xmath8 band @xcite . to find exoplanets , _ kepler _ makes use of the transit method , which detects planet candidates by measuring the flux loss that occurs when a planet crosses the face of its parent star .",
    "however , there are several sources of false positives that must be taken into account when analyzing these candidates , most notably : grazing eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) , ebs ( including hierarchical triples ) whose eclipse depths are diluted by another star through flux contamination , brown dwarfs or low mass stars that have radii comparable to giant exoplanets , and even larger exoplanets that transit a fainter star within the photometric aperture .",
    "because of these sources of false positives , the _ kepler _ team makes a very clear distinction between candidate exoplanets and those that have been dynamically confirmed through spectroscopic radial velocity ( rv ) measurements or through photodynamical modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "kepler objects of interest ( kois ) consist of candidate exoplanets , eclipsing binaries , and known false positives .",

    "an intermediate level of classification consists of `` validated '' exoplanets , which have very low probabilities of being blended ebs as determined through a monte carlo statistical analysis of the _ kepler _ photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    as of october 2014",

    "it is estimated that as many as 15 - 26% of transiting planets may have clearly detected transit timing variations @xcite , which allow for mass determinations photometrically . even still , a majority of kpcs will require rv observations to confirm their planetary nature .",
    "such time - series rv observations are resource intensive , so efficient identification of false positive candidates is necessary to ensure efficient follow - up of likely planets .",
    "in addition to aiding in the confirmation of kpcs , robustly determining the false positive rate amongst kpcs is required when conducting statistical analyses of this population .",
    "a number of studies have attempted to perform such analyses , including investigations of planet frequency as functions of orbital periods and stellar host properties @xcite , and studies of the eccentricity distribution @xcite .    aside from the false positive rate of kpcs , knowledge of the host star(s ) intrinsic properties ( e.g. , mass , radius , effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity ) is required to determine the masses and radii of the exoplanets , as well as to conduct studies of planetary properties as functions of these stellar parameters .",

    "an important sub - category of scenarios 1 and 4 include ebs whose orbits produce only a secondary eclipse and no primary eclipse @xcite",

    "the diluted eb is only detectable if the flux of at least one component of the eb pair is sufficiently high that it appears in the cross - correlation function , or if the combined mass of the eb pair induces a sufficient velocity shift on the third ( brightest ) star in the system .",
    "when the eb pair is composed of cooler k or m dwarf stars in the presence of a hotter primary , they are easier to detect in the nir than in the optical , since the flux contrast is reduced in the @xmath16 band ( e.g. , kepler-16 , * ? ? ?",
    "for a binary system composed of dwarf stars at a signal - to - noise of 100 , secondaries with mass ratios down to @xmath17 are detectable in the @xmath16 band @xcite , while mass ratios are limited to @xmath18 in the optical .",
    "the detection limit for a given system depends on the number of stellar components within the aperture ( e.g. , is it a binary versus a triple system ? ) , and whether any of those components are evolved ( observing in the nir is beneficial for components of differing @xmath9 ratios , not for brightness differences due to differing radii ) .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that apogee is capable of achieving rv precision at the @xmath1 level over long time baselines , and that apogee s multiplexing capability makes it substantially more efficient at identifying false positives due to binaries than other single - object spectrographs working to confirm kois as planets . </S>",
