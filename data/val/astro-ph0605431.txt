    "later , ghirlanda , ghisellini & lazzati ( 2004 ) found a much tighter correlation between @xmath1 and the collimation corrected energy @xmath4 , for those bursts of known jet semiaperture angle @xmath5 ( the so called ghirlanda relation ) .",

    "2003 ) and @xmath10 ( grb 021211 , vreeswijk et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss if these two bursts are real or only @xmath11 outliers .",
    "we will explore three different possibilities :    1 .",
    "these two grbs are seen off axis , as proposed by ramirez ",
    "ruiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; 2 .",
    "what we see is the radiation surviving after having crossed a thomson scattering screen ; 3 .",
    "the real prompt emission of these bursts is subject to a relatively strong hard to soft spectral evolution , and what we have seen is only the hardest , short ",
    "duration part of a much longer emission .",
    "possibility i ) is quite popular , and postulates that the two outliers are normal grbs observed off axis , at a viewing angle @xmath12 of the order of twice the aperture angle of the jet @xmath5 .",
    "( ramirez  ruiz et al . 2005",
    "; see also other off  axis models by yamazaki , ionetoku & nakamura , 2004 ;",
    "eichler & levinson 2004 ) the appeal of this idea is that , within the homogeneous jet scenario , such outliers _ must _ exist , and should outnumber  normal \" grbs by a large factor , given by the solid angle ratios .",
    "of course , since the received radiation for off  axis observers is strongly dimmed by de  beaming , the actual number of observable outliers depends on an accurate calculation of how both the peak energy and the total time integrated flux depend on the viewing angle @xmath12 , the jet aperture @xmath5 and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 .",
    "possibility ii ) postulates the existence of some scattering material along the line of sight , following the original idea of brainerd ( 1994 ) and brainerd et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and later used also by barbiellini et al . ( 2004 ) . in this case",
    "we are receiving the transmitted flux piercing through the scattering screen .",
    "the received flux can be much dimmer than the incident one , and the energy decline of the ( klein  nishina ) scattering cross section imprints an important modification on the transmitted spectrum making it harder and peaking at a larger @xmath1 .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of the two outliers is then softer and brighter , and thus possibly consistent with the amati relation .",
    "case iii ) is based on spectral evolution . for grb 031203 ,",
    "in fact , there is a strong observational evidence that what integral has seen is only a part of a more complex story : besides the high energy emission above 20 kev , observed to a have a flat spectrum and lasting for @xmath330 seconds , there must be a significant emission at much softer energies , lasting for much longer ( i.e. more than a few hundred seconds , see section 4 ) .",
    "this has been inferred through the x  ray flux scattered by dust layers in our galaxy and producing time variable expanding rings around the source ( vaughan et al .",
    "the fluence of this component may have exceeded the fluence above 20 kev , and this supports the idea that it belongs to the prompt emission .",
    "the peak frequency of the combined soft and hard components , albeit uncertain , could well be in the range 310 kev , making grb 031203 consistent with the amati relation . in exploring this idea",
    ", we find strong similarities ( and some differences ) with the behaviour of a recent bursts , observed by swift , namely grb 060218 .",
    "its prompt emission lasted for @xmath33000 seconds , enabling the xrt instruments to follow most of it : for this burst we then have direct information of the high and low energy spectral components .",
    "spectral fitting of the combined ( xrt+bat ) spectra yields a peak frequency perfectly consistent with the amati relation .",
    "since its bolometric isotropic emitted energy is almost the same of grb 031203 , it is natural to consider them as twins .",
    "then the question : is it possible that even grb 980425 had a similar behaviour ?",
    "is it possible that the prompt emission as observed by batse on one hand , and by the wfc and grbm instruments of @xmath14sax on the other , was only part of a more complex story , and that the time integrated @xmath1 is much smaller than what measured in the first @xmath350 seconds ?    to determine",
    "if the two outliers are really so or they only _ appear _ as such , is important for several reasons .",
    "for instance , paczynski & haensel ( 2005 ) recently proposed that all  classical \" grbs are associated to the transition from a neutron to a quark star .",
    "the two outliers , in this framework , should correspond to massive stars outgoing the sn ic explosion _ without _ undergoing the transition to the quark star .",
    "clearly , in this view , grb 980425 and grb 031203 are real outliers , emitting their prompt radiation with different mechanisms than the other ,  classical \" grbs .",
    "moreover , if these two bursts are real outliers they should have a flatter luminosity function with respect to `` normal '' grbs in order to account for their lower detection rate , as recently discussed by liang , zhang and dai ( 2006 ) .    on the contrary , if the two grbs are not outliers , than we strengthen the amati relation , which becomes more universal .",
    "its physical interpretation therefore becomes even more compelling .",
    "assume that the radiation is collimated into a cone of semiaperture angle @xmath5 and that the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight is @xmath12 .",
    "the fireball emits , in its comoving frame , a time integrated spectrum described by a double power law , smoothly joining at some frequency @xmath15 .",
    "this function is a simplified version of the popular band model ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) composed by two powerlaws smoothly joined by an exponential cutoff .",
    "calling @xmath16 , the time integrated energy spectrum , @xmath17 , is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the power laws energy indices below and above @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "since the velocity vectors of the fireball are radially distributed within @xmath5 , we need to integrate , with the appropriate beaming factor , over the entire fireball surface in order to derive the energy spectrum observed at @xmath12 . calling @xmath21^{-1}$ ] we have @xmath22 within the limits of integration , the factor @xmath23 is given by ( see ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ) @xmath24 we then define @xmath25 as the maximum of the @xmath26 function . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] we plot @xmath1 as a function of the time integrated flux @xmath27 , having assumed @xmath28 , and varying @xmath12 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the three curves correspond to @xmath31 , 100 and 200 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath32 behaviour ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) is reached only for large viewing angles . in the insert",
    ", the zoom for small viewing angles shows that @xmath33 changes by a factor 2 for @xmath34 , while @xmath1 remains approximately constant .",
    "the reason for the departure from the @xmath32 behaviour is the following ( see also eichler & levinson 2004 and toma et al .",
    "2005 ) : for large viewing angles , there is a small difference between the flux received from the near and the far edges of the jet , which therefore contribute equally to the total flux . as long as this is the case , we have @xmath32 . as the viewing angle is decreased , the difference of the fluxes received from the edges increases , with the far edge becoming progressively negligible ( with respect to the near edge ) , causing a deficit of total flux with respect to the extrapolation from larger viewing angles .",
    "the reason of the factor 2 difference between the energy observed at @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the following : on axis observers receive most of the flux from a circle of angular radius @xmath37 . at the border of the jet ( i.e. for @xmath36 )",
    "only @xmath3half of the circle is inside the jet and emitting .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath1 is not observed by observers perfectly on  axis , but slightly off . to explain this effect consider the on  axis observer : in this case the maximum flux is again received by the ring of angular radius @xmath37 , with contributions both from smaller angles ( with larger @xmath1 ) and larger angles ( with smaller @xmath1 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath1 is found by integrating the spectra over the jet solid angle .",
    "for slightly off ",
    "axis observers , the contribution from large angles ( on one side of the jet ) is partially missing ( lying otside the jet solid angle ) , while it appears a contributions from still larger angles from the opposite side of the jet .",
    "this latter component is too de  beamed to compensate for the missing one and the net effect is to slightly increase the observed @xmath1 .",
    "-0.5 true cm -0.5 true cm    -0.5 true cm -1 true cm      assume that a subset of bursts have all the same radiated energy @xmath38 if seen on axis .",
    "bursts observed off ",
    "axis will be observed to emit an energy @xmath33 , and their number is proportional to the corresponding solid angle ( see urry & shafer 1984 and celotti et al .",
    "1993 for blazars ) : @xmath39 leading to @xmath40 if bursts have an intrinsic distribution @xmath41 of energetics as seen on axis , than we have to integrate @xmath42 over that distribution .",
    "[ pl ] shows @xmath43 for the three cases shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ( i.e. @xmath31 , 100 and 200 ) . the resulting function is a power law at small energies , and note the increase towards the upper end of the energy range .",
    "this corresponds to observers within the jet aperture angle , who see almost the same energetics . at small energies ,",
    "the slope of the power law is @xmath44 .",
    "this value has a simple explanation . for large viewing angles , in fact , the observed energy @xmath45^{-3}$ ] .",

    "axis events and we require their on  axis energetics to satisfy the amati relation , then we end up to isotropic energies larger than @xmath48 erg ( even larger than suggested by ramirez  ruiz et al .",
    "2004 for grb 031203 using a @xmath49 approximation ) .",
    "all models invoking an intrinsic very large energy output , similar or even larger than the energy output of  classical \" grbs , suffer from a severe problem : the two outliers are the closest of all grbs and it is therefore extremely unlikely that such energetic bursts exist in our vicinity , for all reasonable luminosity functions ( or energy functions ) .",
    "this issue has been discussed in guetta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and with the detailed  trajectories \" calculated in the previous sections the problem is even worse than assuming the naive @xmath50 behaviour , since the steeper dependence requires larger values of @xmath0 to become consistent with the amati relation . for this reason , we discard this possibility .    on the other side , if jets are homogeneous , we _ must _ observe some of them slightly off axis . for a given sensitivity threshold ,",
    "the amount of them depends on the specific value of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 , since larger @xmath13 make the received flux to decrease more rapidly increasing the viewing angle .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , where we have marked the points corresponding to the same viewing angles : increasing by a factor 2 the bulk lorentz factor implies to decrease by an order of magnitude the measured @xmath0 .",
    "[ pl ] makes this argument more quantitative , showing the relative number of expected off ",
    "axis sources with respect to on  axis ones .    this is not meant to discard the fact that some grbs can be seen off ",
    "axis , but only to discard the fact that this is the only reason for bringing the two outliers over the amati relation .",
    "as already discussed , the vicinity of the two outliers argues against these two bursts being normal powerful bursts seen off ",
    "axis , ( with , say , @xmath51 erg or more , as suggested by ramirez ",
    "ruiz et al . 2004 ) since any reasonable luminosity function would make them extremely rare in the volume corresponding to their redshifts .",
    "instead , their vicinity argues in favour of an intrinsically small isotropic energy and luminosity ( see e.g. guetta et al .",
    "we then investigate wether these two bursts are observed through a screen of large optical depth , which at the same time decreases their apparent isotropic energy and _ increases _ their apparent @xmath1",
    ". their intrinsic emission ( i.e. before passing through the scattering screen ) could then be consistent with the amati relation .",

    "we will consider values of @xmath65 even larger than one , and this is possible only if the scattering region is close to the burst , and becomes almost completely ionized by the prompt emission .",
    "otherwise , we would detect very large column densities in the x  ray spectra of the afterglow .",

    "the other effect imprinted on the transmitted spectrum by the scattering screen is the shift of the peak energy @xmath1 to higher values , as shown in fig .",

    "this is due to the declining ( with energy ) klein  nishina cross section @xmath73 . for instance , the transmitted spectrum in the case of @xmath74 has @xmath75 mev , while the intrinsic spectrum has @xmath76 kev .",
    "note also that the bolometric transmitted energy , for this particular case of an intrinsic @xmath68 kev , decreases much less than the factor @xmath77 expected in the thomson regime ( a factor @xmath310 for @xmath78 , instead of the factor 150 we would have in the thomson regime ) .      in fig .",

    "in this work we have explored three different scenarios to see if grb 980425 and grb 031203 are really outliers with respect to the amati relation ( and therefore also outliers to the ghirlanda relation ) or if they only _ appear _ as such .",
    "the first model ( off axis viewing angle ) can bring the two bursts on the amati relation only if the energetics of these bursts ( as would be seen by an on  axis observer ) is very large .",
    "such bursts are not expected to exist at low redshifts , and then this argues against this model as an explanation for the two bursts being only  apparent \" outliers .",
    "then we explored the idea that these bursts have  normal \" energetics and values of @xmath1 , but both these quantities are modified by a scattering cloud located in the vicinity of the bursts . it must be located in the vicinity of the burst because in this case the prompt emission can completely ionise the material ( lazzati & perna 2002 ) , making the soft x  ray afterglow insensitive to absorption . if very close to the burst , the scattering material would be accelerated to large velocities . in the comoving frame of the moving material , incoming photons",
    "would be seen redshifted , and a larger fraction of photons would scatter in the thomson regime . the transmitted spectrum would then be similar ( albeit not identical ) to the one obtained in the case of a not moving material with a larger @xmath65 .",
    "the complete and exact analysis implies to assume the location and width of the scattering screen , which would determine its acceleration , and this lies outside the aim of this paper .    in this model",
    "the intrinsic ( i.e. before scattering ) energetics is greater than the observed one , but not by a large factor .",
    "even with a substantial value of the scattering optical depth ( i.e. @xmath87a few ) , the reduction in flux of the transmitted radiation is of the order of one  a few hundreds .",
    "the scattering process is more effective on low energy x ",
    "ray photons , implying that the transmitted spectrum is  bluer \" than the intrinsic one .",
    "therefore the intrinsic @xmath1 can be smaller than observed .",
    "the two things together ( i.e. intrinsically , the two bursts are more energetic and much redder ) make it possible for them to lie on the amati relation . the increase in energetics is not so large to face the problem of having too energetic bursts at small redshifts .",
    "the problem , for this idea , is to explain why these bursts are surrounded by dense and thick material ( for scattering ) , while other bursts are not .",
    "the partial answer we can give is to consider one obvious selection effect : we see distant bursts only if they are surrounded by material with a small value of @xmath65 , since otherwise they go under the detection threshold .",
    "consider that even values of @xmath88 have almost no effect on the observed spectrum , since in this case more than half of the photons pass through the scattering cloud undisturbed ( see fig .",
    "even the fast variability , if present , would not be smeared out , since the received flux is dominated by the transmitted photons : the scattered ones , having a longer path to travel , arrive later and more diluted in time ( i.e. with a much reduced flux ) .",
    "on the other hand , this model poses several other problems .",
    "the most severe of them is that we expect some signature of the presence of such a thick screen in the vicinity of the burst , produced by the collision of the bursts and supernova ejecta with the screen itself .",
    "the third model we have proposed is the most promising , especially after grb 060218 , which we used as a guide to model the two outliers . in this framework",
    "the derived intrinsic powers and energetics are the least demanding , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ correla ] and in table 2 , where we list the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the two bursts . in the framework of this model",
    "the presence of both a hard and a soft component ( in grb 031203 ) is the result of the spectrum evolving in time , and is not due to two separated components ( i.e. two emission mechanisms ) .",
    "note that the real bolometric and time integrated energetics ( i.e. @xmath0 ) is larger than what derived by considering the high energy spectrum only , but not by a large factor .",
    "the main result of our study is that grb 031203 and grb 980425 are likely to be _ apparent _ outliers : their intrinsic properties are instead consistent with the amati relation ( and therefore it is possible that they obey even the ghirlanda relation , and they would do so with jet opening angles not particularly extreme , see fig .",
    "[ correla ] , although larger than the average values found for `` normal '' grbs ) .",
    "this possibility is strengthened by the fact that grb 060218 , energetically a twin of grb 031203 , lies on the amati relation independently of our modelling .",
    "grb 980425 and grb 031203 could also become consistent with the newly found correlation between the peak luminosity of the prompt , @xmath1 and the  high signal \" timescale @xmath89 ( firmani et al .",
    "2006 ) , if they indeed have @xmath1 around @xmath31 kev .    on the other hand these two bursts , together with grb 060218 , besides being underluminous , have a duration much longer than the other bursts , including the x  ray rich and the x  ray flash population of bursts ( see e.g. lamb , donaghy & graziani 2005 ) .",
    "the inevitable conclusion is that the amati relation ( and possibly the ghirlanda one ) is more robust than previously thought , being obeyed by bursts that are underluminous and with a duration longer than the average one and that ( with respect to the amati relation ) grb 980425 and grb 031203 are not representative of a different population of objects with respect to `` classical '' grbs .",

    "<S> grb 980425 and grb 031203 are apparently two outliers with respect to the correlation between the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath0 emitted in the prompt radiation phase and the peak frequency @xmath1 of the spectrum in a @xmath2 representation ( the so  called amati relation ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss if these two bursts are really different from the others or if their location in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane is the result of other effects , such as viewing them off  axis , or through a scattering screen , or a misinterpretation of their spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case seems particularly interesting after grb 060218 , that , unlike grb 031203 and grb 980425 , had a prompt emission detected both in hard and soft x  </S>",
    "<S> rays which lasted @xmath32800 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed to determine its @xmath1 and total emitted energy . </S>",
    "<S> although it shares with grb 031203 the total energetics , it is not an outlier with respect to the amati correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate if a hard  to  soft spectral evolution in grb 031203 and grb 980425 , consistent with all the observed properties , can give rise to a time integrated spectrum with an @xmath1 consistent with the amati relation .    </S>",
