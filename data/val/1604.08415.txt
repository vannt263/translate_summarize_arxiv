    "revealing the transition stage between prestellar cores and protostars is critical for understanding the entire star forming process .",
    "the low- and intermediate - mass prestellar cores are supposed to initially stay in a hydrostatic equilibrium , referred to as bonnor - ebert sphere @xcite .",
    "the density would gradually increase due to the self contraction and external influences such as turbulence , compression flow , and velocity perturbation which are usually presented in filamentary clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the core becomes supercritical to the self gravity , the `` first collapse '' would occur and generate a much denser object called the first hydrostatic core ( fhsc , or first core ) .",
    "the fhsc has a density of @xmath6  so that the gas and dust become opaque to radiation @xcite .",
    "the temperature in the fhsc would continuously increase due to the self - gravity and possibly on - going accretion .",
    "once the central temperature exceeds 2000 k , the heating would start to dissociate the  molecules .",
    "the  dissociation can provide an efficient coolant for the gas , and largely reduce the thermal pressure support , thereby induce the `` second collapse '' . in this process",
    "the fhsc would evolve into a protostar @xcite .    despite this delicately modelled evolutionary track ,",
    "the observed examples for the transition stage between pre- and protostellar cores are still scarce .",
    "up till now , only a few low - mass cores are suggested to be the fhsc candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "but the two sources on the ridge should represent the emission peaks of the hot dust rather than dense cores . on the pacs 160 @xmath13 image , all the dense cores were identified , with the central positions consistent with the 450-@xmath13 values within @xmath20 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we adopted the 450-@xmath13 core areas ( in the circular case ) to measure the flux densities of all the cores except fir-5a and 5b . at 70 @xmath16 ,",
    "the emission intensities within the fir cores ( except fir-4 and 5 ) range from 1 to 3 jy arcsec@xmath14 which are much higher than the detection limit , but are comparable with the extended emission level ( @xmath21 jy arcsec@xmath14 ) .",

    "the difference is probably due to the low resolution ( @xmath46 ) and large mapping step ( @xmath47 ) in the previous observation . the mapping step is larger than distances of fir-1 and 4 from fir-3 ,",
    "thus the cores would be poorly resolved and emissions from fir-1 and 4 might be largely included in the measured flux density .",

    "the sed fitting resulted in @xmath49 k and @xmath50 .",
    "we note that the @xmath41 value for the hot component at fir-5 is not well constrained because the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sed is dominated by the cold component .",
    "we expect it to have a similar value of @xmath50 .",

    "fir-1 , 2 , and 6 may also have protostars as due to the presence of irac sources or outflows @xcite .",
    "but for these three cores , the stellar emissions should still be too weak to significantly increase the total luminosities .",
    "it is also possible that the ir sources at fir-1 and 2 are just foreground stars .",
    "figure 6 also shows the @xmath121 distribution for the other four samples with specified evolutionary stages , including class-0 protostars @xcite , prestellar cores @xcite , starless cores @xcite , and recently identified fhsc candidates ( with respective references shown in the figure caption ) .",
    "as the figure shows , the more evolved samples do not necessarily have higher absolute luminosities , but instead show steeper slopes for their @xmath121 relations , namely higher @xmath122 values .",
    "the ngc 2024 cores have a similar slope with the prestellar sample ( @xmath120 ) .    from integration of equation ( 1 ) we can have @xmath123 .",
    "it indicates that luminosity @xmath124 can be sensitively affected by @xmath28 .",
    "a sample would have @xmath125 only if the cores have quite similar temperatures .",
    "if @xmath28 varies with the core mass , the @xmath126 relation would be different . assuming a power law of @xmath127",
    ", we can have @xmath128 .",
    "the starless and prestellar samples exhibit relatively flat power laws , probably because the more massive cores are more shielded from the external heating , leading to @xmath129 . in contrast , the protostellar cores might have higher @xmath28 in more massive cores ( @xmath130 ) because the massive ones would preferentially become the birthplace for the high - mass stars and/or multiple system . as a result ,",
    "the relation would become steeper than @xmath131 .",
    "the core sample collected from different regions might also be affected by the variation in @xmath41 , which could be more complicated and are not discussed here .",
    "in fact , ngc 2024 would be distinguished from other samples by the presence of strong external heating which have regulated cores into the similar temperatures , and moreover , increased their absolute luminosities to be even higher than the class-0 sample . in such case",
    ", the absolute luminosities of the individual cores would not effectively trace the evolutionary stages .",
    "similarly , the 70 @xmath16 emission would not indicate embedded protostars as it works in cold isolated regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the hot ridge has @xmath132 k and strong 70 @xmath16 emission , but should be solely illuminated by the external radiation and have no star formation at all . in comparison , as a confirmed protostellar core , fir-4 only have @xmath42 k. it could be heated to much higher temperature if located closer to irs-2b . in this case , the internal emission can be hardly discerned .",
    "we made a semi - quantitative estimation for the dependence of @xmath133 on the stellar radiation .",
    "if irs-2b has a spectral type of b0v , it would provides an ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation with photon flux of @xmath134 s@xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 15 therein ) .",
    "if there is no strong absorbers around the star , the uv radiation at a distance @xmath135 can be approximated as @xmath136 we adopted @xmath137 ev as the average photon energy for the uv radiation field . for a dust core with high opacity in optical ( @xmath138 ) in thermal equilibrium , the dust temperature would be @xcite @xmath139^{1/6}~{\\rm k},\\ ] ] where @xmath140 ergs s@xmath12 cm@xmath14 sr@xmath12 is the unit intensity for the interstellar radiation field @xcite . with the two equations joined together , @xmath28 would be related with @xmath142 and @xmath135 in the form @xmath143 the modelled @xmath144 function is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the @xmath144 curves for b1 and o9 stars are also presented for comparison , with the range between them highlighted in yellow area .",
    "the data for the fir cores and the five positions on the ridge are presented on the diagram .",
    "their @xmath135 values represent the projected distances from irs-2b .    at the observed distances ,",
    "the model predicts a range of @xmath145 k , which reasonably agrees with the temperature on the hot ridge , but is completely deviated from the core temperatures ( 17 - 22 k ) . the low temperatures in the fir cores may indicate the actual distances from irs-2b being much larger than the projected values as seen on the image . in comparison",
    ", the hot ridge should have a small uncertainty in its distance because it mainly traces the pdr near irs-2b .",
    "the data points for the ridge suggests that the modeled @xmath144 function for b0 star can reasonably describe the dust heating in ngc 2024 .",
    "based on the model , the temperatures of fir cores would indicate a distance of @xmath146 pc . as a result",
    ", the filament should be well separated from the hot region around irs-2b , especially considering the fact that the hot gas nebula only has a spatial extent of 0.2 - 0.4 pc as shown in the mips 24 @xmath13 emission .    in the case",
    "that the intervening absorption between irs-2b and the filament is not negligible , the u - v radiation would be transferred to longer wavelengths . in this case",
    "the @xmath144 profile can be evaluated using another dust heating model @xcite : @xmath147 where the dust opacity index is adopted as the value for the hot component ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the luminosity is adopted as the total luminosity of the main - sequence b0 star that is @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "@xmath150 cm g@xmath12 is the dust emissivity at @xmath151 for a condition of @xmath152 and @xmath153  @xcite .",
    "the derived @xmath144 relation is plotted with thick gray line in figure 7 .",
    "this @xmath144 curve is only slightly bellow the uv radiation model for the b0 star , and is also suggestive of a large distance for the fir cores , i.e. 2 to 3 pc from irs-2b .    as another possibility for the low temperature",
    ", the filament can have a strong self - shielding due to its higher opacity , thus can also maintain a low temperature even if located close to irs-2b .",
    "however , if the filament is near the ridge , its outer layer would also be heated to a similar temperature with the ridge , and then exhibit a hot component in its sed _ in addition _ to the cold one .",
    "in fact , the fir cores are much fainter than the ridge at @xmath154 , and their seds are completely dominated by the cold component .",
    "we thus conclude that the filament should indeed have a large distance from irs-2b .",
    "the previous studies showed that the dense molecular gas should be located behind the hii region and pdr @xcite .",
    "the current data further shows that the hot and cold components are actually spatially separated rather next to each other .",
    "the expected spatial layout for the filament and hot gas around irs-2b are shown in figure 7b .",
    "we present an observational study with dust continuum and high - resolution  line emissions to reveal the internal structures and physical properties of the fir cores in ngc 2024 filament .",
    "a particular focus of this paper is the most massive core fir-3 therein .",
    "the main results are :    \\1 .",
    "all the fir cores in the filament are found to have low dust temperatures between 17.5 and 22 k. fir-3 has a compact morphology , dust temperature of 17.5 k , and no significant ir sources .",
    "the physical properties are suggestive of an evolutionary stage younger than class-0 .    \\2 . in fir-3 ,",
    "the  line emissions exhibit a compact temperature rise feature with a peak value of @xmath2 k above the surrounding level of @xmath3 k. from the @xmath83 peak , the central yso is estimated to have an accretion luminosity of @xmath155 .",
    "the temperature rise without infrared counterpart suggests an ongoing or lately occurred collapse from fhsc to class-0 protostar .",
    "the fir cores in ngc 2024 filament have comparable or even higher luminosities than the class-0 cores in the same mass range , but mostly due to the external heating from irs-2b . on the mass - luminosity diagram ,",
    "the fir cores ( except fir-4 ) exhibit a correlation with the power law index ( @xmath120 ) comparable to the prestellar sample . for each core ,",
    "the internal stellar heating appears weak and has no significant influence on temperature or luminosity .",
    "the fir cores have much lower dust temperatures than the hot ridge ( 56 k ) .",
    "the difference in their @xmath28 suggests that the filament should be much more distant from the central heating star irs-2b .",
    "comparison with the dust heating models shows that the filament should be separated from the hot ridge by @xmath156 pc along the line of sight .",
    "the filament and ridge also have distinct dust opacity indices of @xmath157 and 1.6 , respectively .",
    "the observed physical properties suggest an overall cold dense state in the filament . and fir-3 could be an intermediate - mass core with an yso possibly at a transition stage from the fhsc to class-0 . further high - resolution observations ( e.g. with alma ) are expected to resolve its internal structures and reveal the details of the collapse and the accretion state .",
