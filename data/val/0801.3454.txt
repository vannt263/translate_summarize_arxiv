    "since the very beginning of the pioneeristic work by watts and strogatz @xcite , the interest toward small - world networks - an interplay between random and regular networks - has been growing `` exponentially '' .",
    "mainly , there are two reasons that have caused such a `` diffusion '' .",
    "the first reason is due to the topological properties of the small - world network . in synthesis , if @xmath6 is the size of the system , for any finite probability @xmath7 of rewiring , or for any finite added random connectivity @xmath4 ( the two situations correspond to two slightly different procedures for building a small - world network ) one has : a `` short - distance behavior '' , implying that the shortest distance between two arbitrarily chosen sites grows as @xmath8 , as in random networks , and a large clustering coefficient , @xmath9 , as in regular lattices .",
    "the interplay between these two features makes small - world networks representative of many realistic situations ranging from social networks , communications networks , chemical reactions networks , protein networks , neuronal networks , etc .",
    "the second reason is due the fact that , in models defined over small - world networks , despite the presence of an underlying finite dimensional structure - a lattice @xmath0 of dimension @xmath10 - the existence of the short - cut bonds makes such models mean - field - like and - hopefully - exactly solvable .",
    "however , even if such a claim sounds intuitively correct , the complexity of these models turns out to be in general quite high and , compared to numerical works , analytical results , and especially exact results , on small - world networks are still few @xcite-@xcite ( for percolation and synchronization problem we cite in particular @xcite and @xcite ) .    in particular , for @xmath11 an analytical approach seems to be impossible , even though , again , a mean - field critical behavior is expected and has been already confirmed by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "a natural question is , are we able to prove analytically such an assertion ?",
    "if for example @xmath12 , does the mean - field critical behavior hold for any situation ? yet , does the correlation length diverge at the critical temperature ?    furthermore , even if for @xmath13 an exact analytical treatment has been performed at the level of replica symmetry ( rs ) @xcite and one step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) @xcite , the calculations involved are quite long and the solutions of the coupled equations for evaluating the order parameters require a certain numerical work becoming rapidly hard in the 1rsb case . in any case , even if these methods are able to give in principle exact results at any temperature , they are not in general suitable for giving a clear simple and immediate physical picture of the model , even - possibly - within some approximation .",
    "the main problem in fact stays in the presence of the short - loops : as soon as @xmath11 these loops can not be neglected and the `` traditional '' cavity and replica methods seem hardly applicable .",
    "in particular , what happens , for example , if we set @xmath2 negative ?",
    "shall we still expect a second order phase transition ? and what about the phase diagram ?    in this paper , we present a general method to study random ising models defined on small - world graphs built up by adding a random connectivity @xmath4 over an underlying arbitrary lattice @xmath0 having dimension @xmath1 . we shall then show that this method provides - in a very simple and physically appealing way - the answers to the above questions and many others .    as an effective field theory , roughly speaking , the method generalizes the mean - field equation @xmath14 to take into account the presence of the short - range couplings @xmath2 besides the long - range ones @xmath15 .",
    "as we will show , the magnetization @xmath16 of the model defined over the small - world network , shortly the _ random model _ , behaves as the magnetization @xmath17 of the model defined over @xmath0 , shortly the _ unperturbed model _ , but immersed in an effective field to be determined self - consistently .",
    "even if the exactness of this method is limited to the paramagnetic regions ( p ) , it gives the exact critical behavior and the exact critical surfaces , and provide simple qualitative good estimations of the correlation functions in the ferromagnetic ( f ) and spin glass regions ( sg ) .",
    "furthermore , in unfrustrated systems , the method becomes exact at any temperature in the two limits @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the consequences of such a general result are remarkable from both the theoretical and the practical point of view .",
    "once the explicit form of the magnetization of the unperturbed model , @xmath20 , as a function of the couplings @xmath2 and of the external field @xmath21 is known , analytically or numerically , we get an approximation to the full solution of the random model analytically or numerically , respectively , becoming exact in the p region .",
    "if we do not have @xmath20 but we know at least some of its properties , we can still use these properties to derive certain exact relations and the critical behavior of the random model .    in this paper ( part i ) , after discussing the self - consistent equations , we will mainly focus on applying them to study the critical surfaces and the critical behavior in general , whereas in a forthcoming paper ( part ii ) , after showing some examples , we will apply the method to study several models of interest which can be solved analytically ( and very easily ) as for them we know @xmath22 .",
    "we stress that , the critical surfaces , as well as the correlation functions in the p region provided by our method , are exact and - quite interestingly - not based on any special ansatz as the replica - symmetry and the tree - like ansatz .",
    "we prove in particular that : for @xmath3 , independently of the added random connectivity @xmath4 and of the underlying dimension @xmath1 , we always have a second order phase transition with the classical mean - field critical indices but with a finite correlation length if calculated along the distance defined by the underlying lattice @xmath0 ; whereas for @xmath5 , we show that , as soon as @xmath4 is sufficiently large , there exist at least two critical temperatures which , depending on the behavior of @xmath23 - the susceptibility of the unperturbed system - correspond to first or second order phase transitions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the class of small - world networks over which we define the random ising models , stressing some important difference concerning the definition of the correlation functions with respect to the definition of the correlation functions one usually considers in `` ordinary '' random models . in sec .",
    "iii we present our method : in sec .",
    "iiia we provide the self - consistent equations and their relations with physical correlation functions , in sec .",
    "iiib we analyze the stability of the solutions of the self consistent equations and the critical surface and behavior of the system .",
    "we separate the sec .",
    "iiib in the sub - cases @xmath3 and @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "iiic we discuss the limits of the method . in sec .",
    "iiid we study the stability between the f and the sg phases and the phase diagram . finally , in sec .",
    "iiie we mention how to generalize the method to cases in which there are more different short - range couplings @xmath2 , and how to generalize the method to analyze possible disordered antiferromagnetism .",
    "the successive secs .",
    "iv , v and vi are devoted to the derivation of the method . the starting point of the proof is given in sec . iv and is based on a general mapping between a random model and a non random one @xcite-@xcite suitably adapted to our case .",
    "the self - consistent equations are then easily derived in sec .",
    "v. note that , apart from the equations concerning the stability between the p - f and the p - sg transitions , which are derived in sec .",
    "vi , the derivations of the equations provided in the sec .",
    "iiib are mostly left to the reader , since they can be easily obtained by standard arguments of statistical mechanics using the landau free energy @xmath24 that we provide and that is derived in sec .",
    "v too . finally , in sec .",
    "vii we draw some conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we generalize the method to inhomogeneous external fields to make clear the subtle behavior of the correlation functions in small - world models .",
    "the family of models we shall consider are random ising models constructed by super - imposing random graphs with finite average connectivity @xmath4 onto some given lattice @xmath0 whose set of bonds @xmath25 and dimension will be indicated by @xmath26 and @xmath1 , respectively . given an ising model ( _ the unperturbed model _ ) of @xmath6 spins coupled over @xmath0 through a coupling @xmath2 with hamiltonian @xmath27 and given an ensemble @xmath28 of unconstrained random graphs @xmath29 , @xmath30 , whose bonds are determined by the adjacency matrix elements @xmath31 , we define the corresponding small - world model as described by the following hamiltonian @xmath32 the free energy @xmath33 and the averages @xmath34 being defined in the usual ( quenched ) way as ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 and @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the partition function of the quenched system    @xmath39    @xmath40 the boltzmann - average of the quenched system ( @xmath41 depends on the given realization of the @xmath42 s and of @xmath29 : @xmath43 ; for shortness we later will omit to write these dependencies )    @xmath44    and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two product measures given in terms of two normalized measures @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively : @xmath49 @xmath50    the variables @xmath51 specify whether a `` long - range '' bond between the sites @xmath52 and @xmath53 is present ( @xmath54 ) or absent ( @xmath55 ) , whereas the @xmath56 s are the random variables of the given bond @xmath25 . for the @xmath56 s we will not assume any particular distribution , while , to be specific , for the @xmath57 s we shall consider the following distribution @xmath58 this choice leads in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59 to a number of long range connections per site distributed according to a poisson law with mean @xmath60 ( so that in average there are in total @xmath61 bonds ) .",
    "note however that the main results we report in the next section are easily generalizable to any case in which eq .",
    "( [ pg ] ) holds , or holds only in the thermodynamic limit due a sufficiently small number of constrains among the matrix elements @xmath57 .",
    "the quantities of major interest are the averages , and the quadratic averages , of the correlation functions which for shortness will be indicated by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for example , the following are non connected correlation functions of order @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and the indices @xmath67 are supposed all different . for shortness we will keep on to use the symbols @xmath62 and @xmath63 also for the connected correlation function since , as we shall see in the next section",
    ", they obey to the same rules of transformations .",
    "we point out that the set of indices @xmath67 is fixed along the process of the two averages .",
    "this implies in particular that , if we consider the spin with index @xmath52 and the spin with index @xmath53 , their distance remains undefined , or more precisely , the only meaningful distance between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , is the distance defined over @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the euclidean distance between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which we will indicate as @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper , it must be kept in mind that , for example , @xmath69 is very different from the correlation function @xmath70 of two points at a fixed distance @xmath71 , @xmath71 being here the distance defined over both @xmath0 and the random graph @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the minimum number of bonds to join two points among both the bonds of @xmath26 and the bonds of the random graph @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , if , for @xmath72 , one considers all the possible realizations of the poisson graph , and then all the possible distances @xmath71 between two given points @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one has @xmath73 where here @xmath74 is the probability that , in the system with @xmath6 spins , the shortest path between the vertices @xmath52 and @xmath53 has length @xmath71 .",
    "if we now use @xmath70 @xmath75 @xcite ( in the p region holds the equality ) and the fact that the average of @xmath71 with respect to @xmath74 is of the order @xmath76 , we see that the two point connected correlation function ( [ cf1 ] ) goes to 0 in the thermodynamic limit . similarly , all the connected correlation functions defined in this way are zero in this limit .",
    "note however , that this independence of the variables holds only if @xmath72 .",
    "this discussion will be more deeply analyzed along the proof by using another point of view , based on mapping the random model to a suitable fully connected model .",
    "depending on the temperature t , and on the parameters of the probability distributions , @xmath77 and @xmath7 , the random model may stably stay either in the p , in the f , or in the sg phase . in our approach for the f and sg phases there are two natural order parameters that will be indicated by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , for any correlation function , quadratic or not , there are two natural quantities indicated by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and that in turn will be calculated in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "to avoid confusion , it should be kept in mind that in our approach , for any observable @xmath82 , there are - in principle - always two solutions that we label as f and sg , but , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "iiid , for any temperature , only one of the two solutions is stable and useful in the thermodynamic limit .    in the following",
    ", we will use the label @xmath83 to specify that we are referring to the unperturbed model with hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) .",
