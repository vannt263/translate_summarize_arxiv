    "among the 194 extra - solar planets discovered in the last decade , the  hot jupiters \" currently present the greatest challenges to understanding and the greatest observational rewards . efforts to explain their origin have transformed theories of planetary - system formation .",
    "do these planets form via gravitational instability in cold discs , or must they form by core accretion beyond the ice boundary , where ice mantles on dust grains allow rapid agglomeration of a massive core of heavy elements ? how rapidly do they migrate inwards through a massive protoplanetary disc , and what mechanism halts the migration ?    the subset of these planets that transit their parent stars are of key importance in addressing these questions , because they are the only planets whose radii and masses can be determined directly .",
    "the first such discovery @xcite confirmed the gas - giant nature of the hot jupiters ; indeed the inflated radius of hd 209458b continues to challenge our understanding of exoplanetary interior structure .",
    "subsequent discoveries have presented further surprises .",
    "the apparent correlation between planet mass and minimum survivable orbital separation among the known transiting planets offers important clues to the  stopping mechanism \" for inward orbital migration of newly - formed giant planets in protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "the high core mass of the recently - discovered saturn - mass planet orbiting hd 149026 ( sato et al . 2005 ) presents difficulties for models of planet formation via gravitational instability .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations of the secondary eclipses of tres-1b , hd 209458b and hd189733b have provided the first estimates of the temperatures in these planets cloud decks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to date , however , only ten such planets have been discovered .",
    "three of the ten have been found via targeted radial - velocity searches , the other six through large - scale photometric surveys for transit events .",
    "the primary goal of the superwasp project ( pollacco et al .",
    "2006 ) is to discover bright , new transiting exoplanets in sufficiently large numbers that we can place studies of their mass - radius relation , and the suspected relationship between minimum orbital distance and planet mass , on a secure statistical footing .",
    "superwasp s  shallow - but - wide \" approach to transit hunting is designed to find planets that are not only sufficiently bright ( @xmath1 ) for high - precision radial - velocity follow - up studies to be feasible on telescopes of modest aperture , but also for detailed follow - up studies such as transmission spectroscopy during transits , and spitzer secondary - eclipse observations .",
    "only five of the ten presently - known transiting planets orbit stars brighter than @xmath2 and so have such strong follow - up potential .    here",
    "we present a methodology used in the search for exoplanetary transit candidates in data from the first year of superwasp operation .",
    "we employ the sysrem algorithm of @xcite to identify and remove patterns of correlated systematic error from the stellar light - curves .",
    "we present a refined version of the box least - squares ( bls ) algorithm of @xcite , which permits a fast grid search and efficient refinement of the most promising solutions without binning the data . using simulated transits injected into real superwasp data",
    "we develop a filtering strategy to optimise and quantify the recovery rate and false - alarm probability as functions of stellar magnitude and transit depth .",
    "we develop simple plausibility tests for transit candidates , using the transit duration and depth to estimate the mass of the parent star and the radius of the planet .",
    "we mine publicly - available catalogues to obtain the @xmath3 colours , proper motions and other properties of the host stars . combined with the transit durations and depths ,",
    "these give improved physical parameters of each system and help us to identify the most promising candidates for spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "the superwasp camera array , located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma , canary islands , consists of five 200 mm f/1.8 canon lenses each with an andor ccd array of @xmath4 13.5@xmath5 m pixels , giving a field of view 7.8 degrees square for each camera . by cycling through a sequence of 7 or 8 fields located within 4 hours of the meridian , at field centres separated by one hour right ascension , superwasp monitored up to 8%  of the entire sky for between 4 and 8 hours each night during the 2004 observing season .",
    "the average interval between visits to each field was 6 minutes .",
    "each exposure was of 30s duration , and was taken without filters .    between 2004 may and september , the five superwasp cameras secured light - curves of some @xmath6 stars brighter than @xmath7 . the long - term precision of the data ( determined from the rms scatter of individual data points for non - variable stars ) is 0.004 mag at @xmath8 , degrading to 0.01 mag at @xmath9 . our sampling rate and run duration guarantee that 4 or more transits should have been observed in 90% of all systems with periods",
    "less than 5 days , and 100%  of all systems with periods less than 4 days , though some incompleteness is expected at periods very close to integer multiples of 1 day .",
    "the data were reduced using the superwasp pipeline . the pipeline carries out an initial statistical analysis of the raw images , classifying them as bias frames , flat fields , dark frames or object frames .",
    "the bias frames are combined using optimally weighted averaging with outlier rejection .",
    "automated sequences of flat fields secured at dawn and dusk are corrected for sky illumination gradients and combined using an optimal algorithm that maps and corrects for the pattern introduced by the finite opening and closing time of the iris shutter on each camera .",
    "science frames are bias - subtracted , corrected for shutter travel time and corrected for pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and vignetting using the flat - field exposures .",
    "flat fields from different nights are combined using a algorithm in which the weights of older flat field frames decay on a timescale of 14 days .",
    "a catalogue of objects on each frame is constructed using extractor , the starlink implementation of the sextractor @xcite source detection software .",
    "an automated field recognition algorithm identifies the objects on the frame with their counterparts in the tycho-2 catalogue @xciteand establishes an astrometric solution with an rms precision of 0.1 to 0.2 pixel .",
    "aperture photmetry is then carried out at the positions on each ccd image of all objects in the usno - b1.0 catalogue @xcite with second - epoch red magnitudes brighter than 15.0 .",
    "fluxes are measures in three apertures with radii of 2.5 , 3.5 and 4.5 pixels .",
    "the ratios between the fluxes in different pairs of apertures yield a  blending index \" which quantifies image morphology , and is used to flag blended stellar images and extended , non - stellar objects .",
    "individual objects are allocated superwasp identifiers of the form  1swasp j@xmath10 \" , which are based on their usno - b1.0 coordinates for equinox j2000.0 and epoch j2000.0 .",
    "the resulting fluxes are corrected for primary and secondary extinction , and the zero - point for each frame is tied to a network of local secondary standards in each field , whose magnitudes are derived from wasp fluxes transformed via a colour equation relating instrumental magnitudes to tycho-2 @xmath11 magnitudes .",
    "the resulting fluxes are stored in the superwasp data archive at the university of leicester .",

    "@xmath13 26. a search of the wasp archive , centred on this position and covering the full 7.8@xmath14-square field of view of the camera , yielded light - curves of 7840 stars brighter than wasp @xmath15 for which a catalogue query indicated that the light - curves comprised more than 500 valid photometric data points .",
    "indeed most of the objects in this field had more than 2000 valid photometric measurements .",
    "the maxipara 2 mum number of valid observations in any light - curve was 2301 .",
    "the resulting set of light - curves was loaded into a rectangular matrix of 7840 light - curves by 2301 observations for further processing .",
    "the expected number of transits present in the observed light - curve of any given star depends on the sampling pattern of the observations and the period and phase of the transit cycle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntrans ] we plot the probability of @xmath16 or more transits being present in the data , as a function of orbital period .",
    "we consider a transit as having been `` observed '' if data have been obtained within the phase ranges @xmath17 or @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the expected transit duration as described at the start of section  [ sect : algorithms ] and @xmath20 is the orbital period .",
    "the regular sampling pattern on most nights of acceptable quality generally ensures that at least 40 percent of a given transit event must be well - observed if it is to be counted according to this criterion . for the field",
    "studied here , the prospects of observing at least three transits is 70%  or better at periods less than 3.5 days .",
    "the reduced data from the pipeline inevitably contain low - level systematic errors . in this section",
    "we describe a coarse initial decorrelation and application of the sysrem algorithm of @xcite . before modelling and removing patterns of correlated error",
    "we perform a coarse initial decorrelation by referencing each star s magnitude to its own mean , removing small night - to - night and frame - to - frame differences in the zero - point , and measuring the additional , independent variance components introduced in individual stars by their intrinsic variablility and in some observations by patchy cloud .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional array @xmath21 of processed stellar magnitudes from the pipeline .",
    "the first index @xmath22 denotes a single ccd frame within the entire season s data .",
    "the second index labels an individual star .",
    "we compute the mean magnitude of each star : @xmath23 where the weights @xmath24 incorporate both the formal variance @xmath25 calculated by the pipeline from the stellar and sky - background fluxes , and an additional systematic variance component @xmath26 introduced in individual frames by passing wisps of cloud , sahara dust events and other transient phenomena which degrade the extinction correction : @xmath27 data points from frames of dubious quality are thus down - weighted .",
    "the weight is set to zero for any data point flagged by the pipeline as either missing or bad .",
    "the zero - point correction for each frame @xmath22 follows : @xmath28 in this case the weights are defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an additional variance caused by intrinsic stellar variability .",
    "this down - weights variable stars in the calculation of the zero - point offset for each frame .",
    "initially we set @xmath31 , and compute the average magnitude @xmath32 for every star @xmath33 and the zero - point offset @xmath34 for every frame .",
    "to determine the additional variance of @xmath30 for the intrinsic variability of a given star @xmath33 from the data themselves , we use a maximum - likelihood approach .",
    "we define a data vector @xmath35 containing the light - curve of star @xmath33 , and a model @xmath36 . if both sets of errors are gaussian , then the probability of the @xmath22th individual observation is @xmath37    the likelihood of the entire data vector for star @xmath33 given the model is @xmath38 where @xmath39    taking logs and differentiating , we find that the maximum - likelihood value of @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we solve the equation @xmath42 iteratively for each @xmath30 , holding the @xmath26 fixed .",
    "we then perform an analogous calculation , summing over all the stars in the @xmath22th frame and solving @xmath43 for each @xmath26 holding the @xmath30 fixed .    at this stage",
    "we refine the mean magnitude per star , the zero point offsets and the additional variances for stellar variability and patchy cloud , by iterating eqs .",

    "for example , the superwasp bandpass spans the visible spectrum , introducing significant colour - dependent terms into the extinction correction .",
    "the pipeline attempts to calibrate and remove secondary extinction using tycho-2 @xmath45 colours for the brighter stars , but uncertainties in the colours of the tycho-2 stars and the lack of colour information for the fainter stars means that some systematic errors remain .",
    "bright moonlight or reduced transparency arising from stratospheric sahara dust events reduce the contrast between faint stars and the sky background , altering the rejection threshold for faint sources in the sky - background annulus and biassing the photometry for faint stars .",
    "the superwasp camera lenses are vignetted across the entire field of view , and the camera array",
    "is not autoguided , so polar - axis misalignment causes stellar images to drift by a few tens of pixels across the ccd each night .",
    "it is possible that temperature changes during the night could affect the camera focus , changing the shape of the point - spread function across the field and biassing the photometry for fainter stars .",
    "these systematic errors , and no doubt others as - yet unidentified , have a serious impact on the detection threshold for transits .",
    "@xcite discussed methods of characterising the structure of the covariance matrix for a given stellar light - curve .",
    "the first and simplest method is to carry out boxcar smoothing of each night s data , with a smoothing length comparable to the typical 2.5-hour duration of a planetary transit .",
    "for every set of @xmath46 points spanning a complete 2.5-hour interval interval starting at the @xmath47th observation , we construct an optimally - weighted average magnitude @xmath48 with bad observations down - weighted as above using @xmath49 .",
    "the rms scatter @xmath50 in the smoothed light - curve of @xmath51 values is then compared to the rms scatter @xmath52 of the individual data points . for uncorrelated noise ,",
    "we expect @xmath53 , where @xmath46 is the average number of observations made in a 2.5-hour interval . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsraw ] we plot @xmath52 , @xmath50 and @xmath54 as functions of @xmath11 magnitude . for clarity",
    ", we exclude all obviously variable stars having @xmath55 magnitude ( as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : varwts ] ) .",
    "the rms scatter in the binned data is typically 0.0025 magnitude for the brightest non - variable stars , far worse than the 0.0008 magnitude that would be achieved if the noise were uncorrelated .    the covariance structure of the correlated noise is quantified by the power - law dependence of the rms scatter on the number of observations used in the boxcar smoothing : @xmath56 for completely uncorrelated noise we expect @xmath57 , while for completely correlated noise ( e.g. from intrinsic large - amplitude stellar variability on timescales longer than the longest smoothing length considered but shorter than the data duration ) we expect the rms scatter to be independent of the number of data points , giving @xmath58",
    ". we measure @xmath59 for each star using the incomplete smoothing intervals at the start and end of the night .",
    "we create a set of binned magnitudes obtained for @xmath60 consecutive observations .",
    "the rms scatter in the binned magnitudes for each value of @xmath61 is then plotted as a function of @xmath46 and a power - law fitted to determine @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsraw ] we plot @xmath59 as a function of @xmath11 magnitude , again excluding intrinsic variable stars having @xmath55 magnitude .",
    "as expected , we find the effects of correlated noise to be most pronounced for the brightest non - variable stars . even at our faint cutoff limit of @xmath62 , however , we do not fully recover the uncorrelated noise value @xmath63 .",
    "we use the sysrem algorithm of @xcite to identify and remove patterns of correlated noise in the data .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for details of the implementation .",
    "the sysrem algorithm produces a corrected magnitude @xmath64 for star @xmath33 at time @xmath22 , given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the number of basis functions ( each representing a distinct pattern of systematic error ) removed .",
    "an interesting property of the sysrem algorithm is that the inverse variance weighted mean value of each basis function , multiplied by the corresponding stellar coefficient , is so close to zero for all but the most highly variable stars that it is not necessary to repeat the coarse decorrelation .",
    "the inverse variance weighted mean change in the zero - point of each frame is generally less than 0.001 magnitude , again rendering further coarse decorrelation unnecessary after the final application of sysrem .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as described by tamuz et al , we find several distinct basis functions @xmath67 representing patterns of correlated systematic error in the data which affect every star in the field to an extent quantified by the coefficents @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : basfuncs ] we plot the first four basis functions against hour angle , after folding the entire season s basis - function values on a period of 1 sidereal day .",
    "the first and strongest basis function produced by sysrem shows a generally smooth night - to - night variation @xmath69 with a characteristic timescale of order 10 days . superimposed on this large - amplitude",
    ", long - timescale variation is a small - amplitude , linear trend through each night .",
    "neither variation appears to be related directly to either the lunar cycle or to transparency losses caused by intermittent sahara dust events , but the stellar coefficients @xmath70 show a strong correlation with magnitude at @xmath71 .",
    "we infer that this systematic error component may be related to a combination of sky brightness and atmospheric transparency that could affect the rejection threshold for faint stellar images in the sky aperture , leading the pipeline to underestimate the brightness of faint stars in bright moonlight and/or poor transparency .",
    "the second and fourth basis functions resemble half - sinusoids , 90 degrees out of phase , when plotted modulo sidereal time .",
    "both the secondary extinction and the flat - field vignetting correction are expected to vary as functions of sidereal time .",
    "as discussed above , superwasp is not autoguided , and a small misalignment of the polar axis causes stellar images to re - trace the same path across the ccd , a few tens of pixels long , every sidereal day .",
    "the second and fourth basis functions are probably a linear combination of these two effects .",
    "the corresponding stellar coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 should be correlated with departures from the stellar colour used for the extinction modelling , and with the gradient of the residuals in the vignetting function along the trajectory of each stellar image .",
    "the third basis function is a linear trend through the night , generally increasing but occasionally decreasing .",
    "the origin of this component is not obvious , but one possibility is that it could arise from temperature - dependent changes in the camera focus through the night .",
    "the fifth and higher basis functions gave significantly smaller changes in @xmath74 than the first four , and their form appears to represent mainly stochastic events affecting only a few points in the light - curves of a relatively small number of stars . to avoid the danger of removing genuine stellar variability , we modelled the global systematic errors using only the first four sysrem basis functions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmstam ] we show the rms - magnitude diagram and covariance index @xmath59 as functions of @xmath11 magnitude after processing with sysrem .",
    "we find that for stars fainter then @xmath75 the noise in the corrected light - curves is almost uncorrelated . for brighter stars some residual evidence of correlated noise remains .",
    "on the 2.5-hour timescale of a typical transit , however , the rms amplitude of the correlated noise component is reduced to values of order 0.0015 magnitude with the help of sysrem .",
    "we use an adaptation of the bls algorithm @xcite for the initial search .",
    "we set up a coarse search grid of frequencies and transit epochs .",
    "the frequency step is such that the accumulated phase difference between successive frequencies over the full duration of the dataset corresponds to the expected width of a transit at the longest period searched .",
    "a set of transit epochs is defined at each frequency , at phase intervals equal to the expected transit width at that frequency .",
    "the expected transit duration is computed from the orbital frequency using kepler s third law assuming a stellar mass of 0.9 m@xmath76 .",
    "since the majority of the main - sequence stars in the magnitude range of interest have masses between 0.7 and 1.3 m@xmath76 and the transit duration at a given period scales as @xmath77 , the predicted transit duration is unlikely to be in error by more than 20 to 30 percent even at the extremes of the mass range .    at each trial period and epoch , the transit depth and goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath74 are calculated using a variant of the optimal fitting methods of kovacs et al , reformulated such that the goodness - of - fit criterion has the dimensions of the @xmath74 statistic .",
    "a similar approach has also been used by @xcite and by @xcite .    after processing with sysrem ,",
    "the light - curve of a given star comprises a set of observations @xmath78 with associated formal variance estimates @xmath79 and additional , independent variances @xmath26 to account for transient spatial irregularities in atmospheric extinction .",
    "we define inverse - variance weights @xmath80 and subtract the optimal average value @xmath81 to obtain @xmath82 .",
    "we also define @xmath83 summing over the full dataset .",
    "note that the weights defined here include the independent variance component @xmath30 .",
    "this has the effect of lowering the significance of high - amplitude variable stars , but has little effect on low - amplitude variables such as planetary transit candidates .    in the bls method",
    ", the transit model is characterised by a periodic box function whose period , phase and duration determine the subset @xmath84 of  low \" points observed while transits are in progress .",
    "in many implementations the partitioning of the data can be the slowest part of the bls procedure @xcite .",
    "we achieve substantial speed gains by computing the orbital phase @xmath85 of each data point and sorting the phases in ascending order together with their original sequence numbers .",
    "we partition the phase - ordered data into a contiguous block of out - of - transit points for which @xmath86 , where @xmath19 is the transit duration and @xmath20 is the orbital period , and the complement of this subset comprising the in - transit points .",
    "the summations that follow use the phase - ordered array of sequence numbers to access the in - transit points .",

    "we also reject those best - fit solutions for which the phase - folded light curve contains gaps greater than 2.5 times the expected transit duration .",
    "such solutions arise in a small number of stars that suffer from errors in the vignetting correction near the extremities of the field of view , or from transient dust motes in the optics that are not completely flat - fielded out .",
    "stellar images drift across the image by a few dozen pixels during a typical night , because superwasp is unguided and has a small misalignment of the polar axis .",
    "the drift pattern in the light curve recurs on a period of one sidereal day and its form depends strongly on location .",
    "it is significant mainly around the edges of the chip and near transient dust - ring features in the flat field .",
    "the sysrem algorithm is not effective at removing this type of variation from the small number of stars affected , so we reject them at this stage in the analysis .",
    "there is sufficient overlap between cameras that there is a high probability of the same star being recorded in a less problematic part of an adjacent camera s field of view .",
    "we select candidates for finer analysis by making cuts on two light - curve statistics , in both of which we expect stars showing periodic transit signals to lie well out in one tail of the distribution .",

    "note that burke et al use a threshold of 2.75 for final selection on the latter statistic .",
    "even this relatively loose set of selection criteria eliminates 95.5 to 97.5 percent of all the stars in the sample , typically leaving 100 to 200 surviving objects worthy of more detailed study from an initial sample of several thousand stars .    in order to ensure that the most obvious transit candidates are not rejected by the filtering , we injected synthetic patterns of transits , with randomly - generated periods and epochs , into the light - curves of 100 randomly - chosen stars in the test dataset .",

    "those stars selected for further study are circled , confirming that the preselection procedure captures a set of objects that includes nearly all candidates with significant transit signals .",
    "those that were not selected were either too faint and noisy to yield a significant detection , or were superimposed on light - curves of intrinsically variable stars that failed to satisfy the other selection criteria .",

    "some are grazing eclipsing binaries ; others are multiple systems in which the light of a stellar eclipsing pair is diluted ; others still have low - mass stellar or brown - dwarf companions whose radii are similar to those of gas - giant planets .",

    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that ellipsoidal variables can be rejected with a high degree of certainty as stellar binaries .",
    "detached stellar binaries with orbital periods of 1 to 5 days can easily be mistaken for transiting exoplanet systems if they exhibit either grazing eclipses or deeper eclipses diluted by the light of a blended third star . in either case , the equipotential surfaces of the two stars will often be sufficiently ellipsoidal to yield detectable out - of - transit variability .    since the data have already been partitioned into a subsets of points inside and outside transit , we approximate the ellipsoidal variation with phase angle @xmath130 as @xmath131 to the out - of - transit residuals @xmath132 .",
    "we sum over the subset @xmath133 of points outside transit to define @xmath134 and so obtain both the amplitude and formal variance @xmath135 of the ellipsoidal variation .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the amplitude is @xmath136 any candidate for which the sign of @xmath137 indicates that the system is significantly brighter at quadrature than at conjunction , with s / n@xmath138 or so , is noted as a probable stellar impostor . in table",
    "[ tab : filters1 ] we see that two of the possible transit - like candidates identified by eye are disqualified in this way .",
    "the 5@xmath103 detection threshold for ellipsoidal variation is nearly independent of orbital period , but ranges from to 0.003 magnitude at @xmath139 to 0.001 mag at @xmath140 for the dataset studied here .",
    "the expected amplitude of ellipsoidal variation depends on the ratio of the primary radius to the orbital separation , and on the mass ratio of the system .",
    "the superwasp transit search yields many objects in which a solar - type star appears in a 1 to 2-day orbit about a companion with a radius of 1 to 2 r@xmath141 .",
    "simple projected - area calculations based on a standard roche equipotential surface model for a main - sequence star of 1 m@xmath76 with a 0.2 m@xmath76 companion in a 1.5-day orbit yield an ellipsoidal variation of order 0.002 magnitude , which should be detectable with high significance in an isolated system with @xmath142 or so . companions less massive than this may not yield detectable ellipsoidal variations , but are sufficiently interesting in their own right to be worth following up .",
    "ellipsoidal variability can also help to eliminate impostor systems where a bright foreground star is blended with a background eclipsing binary .",
    "if one component of an eclipsing stellar binary is evolved , such as in an rs cvn system with a 2.5 to 3.0 r@xmath76 k subgiant and a solar - type main - sequence star in a 3-day orbit , the ellipsoidal variation can be as great as 0.02 to 0.05 magnitude .",
    "if such a system exhibits a partial primary eclipse 0.1 to 0.3 magnitude deep and a shallow secondary eclipse , and is blended with a foreground star 2 to 3 magnitudes brighter , it can mimic an exoplanetary transit .",
