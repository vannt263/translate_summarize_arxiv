    "quantum measurement has attracted much attention because of its fundamental importance as well as its relevance to quantum computing .",
    "however , there are still vastly different points of view on quantum measurement .",
    "on one hand , the zeno effect predicts that continuous measurement can freeze the state of a quantum system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , interaction with the outside environment such as a detector is expected to lead to the collapse of the state of the measured system .",
    "therefore , reconciling these views by detailing the real mechanisms for selected model systems is very important .",
    "many experiments on two - level quantum systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have been performed to study this problem .",
    "together with experimental investigations , some theoretical studies were also devoted to this important topic .",
    "et al _  @xcite have theoretically studied a mesoscopic qubit - plus - detector system .",
    "the qubit consists of two coupled - quantum dots ( cqd s ) while the detector is a quantum point contact ( qpc ) interacting locally with one of the dots .",
    "the authors derived a set of bloch - type rate equations to describe the measurement effects .",
    "@xcite considered the same setup and developed a lindblad quantum master equation using the quantum trajectory approach for dissipative processes . however , while reasonable result was obtained for a pair of identical quantum dots in both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , these works predicted unreasonable equal occupation probabilities in the dots when their energy levels are different .",
    "subsequently , li _ et al _",
    "@xcite developed a unified quantum master equation with the markovain approximation and obtained distinct occupation probabilities for non - identical quantum dots as expected . in this work",
    ", we further study this qubit - plus - detector system following the original approach of gurvitz _ et al _",
    "we have found that the unphysical result of identical occupation probabilities in non - identical dots mentioned above is only due to neglecting higher - order terms in their derivation .",
    "we will show that higher - order terms are of fundamental importance .",
    "retaining additional terms in our calculations leads to physically valid results consistent with those of li _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "our analysis also illustrates the detailed mechanism of quantum measurement .",

    "electrostatic effects are included in @xmath5 : an extra electron in the left dot will lead to an effective variation @xmath6 in the coupling @xmath7 between the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the two reservoirs of the qpc . the resulting coupling then becomes @xmath10 .",

    "the vacuum state @xmath15 corresponds to the state of the entire system with no extra electron in the cqd s and before the transfer of any electron between the reservoirs in the qpc .",
    "then , @xmath16 for instance denotes the probability amplitude that the extra electron is in the left dot and an electron has passed through the barrier in the qpc .",

    "substituting the many - body wave function [ eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) ] and the hamiltonian [ eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) ] into the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath20 gives an infinite set of linear equations for the probability amplitudes @xmath12 . performing a laplace transform to each equation ,",

    "when the temperature is low enough ( here it is chosen zero for simplicity , as in ref .",
