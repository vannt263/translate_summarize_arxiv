    "width=336 ]    the optical spectra also reveal the positive detection of a series of co @xmath3 bandheads ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the peak depth of the bandheads is offset by @xmath72 from the atomic transitions and that the bandheads show absorption to @xmath73 . at first glance",
    ", this suggests that the molecular gas has an extremely high velocity dispersion , a highly unlikely attribute for molecular gas .",
    "we interpret these unusual characteristics , instead , as the result of absorption from high rotational levels ( @xmath74 ) which have been populated by uv pumping from the grb afterglow .",
    "this is analogous to the excitation of fine - structure levels in fe@xmath75 , si@xmath75 , and o@xmath76 gas in other grb galaxies @xcite .",
    "such levels would be easily resolved with an echelle spectrum .",
    "we have fitted the co @xmath3 bandheads in the r1200 and b600 data with a series of models and find preferred values @xmath4 , @xmath77 , @xmath78  k , and a velocity offset from @xmath68 of @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) .",
    "the preferred values were found by minimizing the residuals between the data and the model for the 1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , and 4 - 0 co bands simultaneously . each model included all rotational levels up to @xmath80 , for a total of 225 co transitions with transition data taken from fits to empirical data @xcite .",
    "we then visually compared the model prediction with the 6 - 0 and 8 - 0 co bands seen in the b600 spectrum to assure consistency over a larger range of @xmath57-values ; these bandheads set an upper limit of @xmath81 .",
    "although a parameterization of the gas with an excitation temperature ( @xmath82 ) is not formally valid for a photon - pumped gas , we achieve a reasonable model .",
    "we have analyzed the h@xmath0 gas in a similar fashion . because the lyman - werner lines are heavily saturated and blended , there is little sensitivity to the doppler parameter @xmath83 . adopting @xmath84 , we varied @xmath85 and @xmath86  and compared these models against the data at @xmath87   . under the assumption that h@xmath0 absorption dominates the opacity at @xmath88   , we constrain @xmath6 and @xmath89 to 300  k. models with larger / smaller @xmath86  values conflict with the observations .",
    "our analysis sets an upper limit to the integrated molecular fraction @xmath90 , but we expect that the sightline is comprised of at least two clouds : one predominantly atomic and the other molecular .    assuming solar relative abundances , the implied o column density is @xmath91 for a galactic equivalent column density @xmath92 .",
    "this metal column density implies that there should be significant absorption of soft x - rays by k - shells of o , si , etc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dustx]b , we present the x - ray spectrum and best - fit model of the _",
    "swift_/xrt data obtained 0.6376  ks after the burst @xcite .",
    "we estimate an effective @xmath10 and a photon index @xmath93 for a power - law spectrum .",
    "therefore , the metal column densities from analysis of both the uv and x - ray spectra are consistent . on the other hand , assuming the galactic dust - to - metals ratio would give an extinction ( @xmath94  mag ) inconsistent with the observations . we conclude that the gas has a much lower dust - to - metals ratio than galactic @xcite .",
    "the previous section described the physical properties of the ism and the first clear detection of molecular gas in a grb host galaxy . with an @xmath9  mag , this represents a molecule - rich `` translucent '' sightline with effective uv shielding of co @xcite . with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the abundance ratio of co to h@xmath0 is @xmath97 .",
    "these values are consistent with detailed models of co photodissociation in translucent environments ( e.g. , model t3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with the transition region between diffuse and dark clouds in the correlation plot of co versus h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "altogether , the gas exhibits roughly solar metallicity , the dust has an extinction curve similar to that observed for galactic molecular clouds , including a 2175    bump , and the co / h@xmath0 ratio is consistent with galactic translucent clouds .",
    "we infer that at least some molecular clouds in the young universe have similar properties to those observed locally .",
    "there are , however , two notable differences from the galactic ism . first , we observe a very large column density .",
    "this attribute is common to grbs yet contrasts with the surface densities of local disks .",
    "while the formation of a molecular cloud requires a large dust column to absorb h@xmath0-dissociating photons , the analysis of @xcite implies a 20 times lower column than observed . perhaps the large @xmath98  value is a coincidence ;",
    "these are routinely observed along grb sightlines without molecules @xcite and our preferred model of the co absorption suggests a velocity offset of @xmath99 from the atomic metal lines .",
    "the second key difference is that we infer a much lower dust - to - metals ratio than galactic whether that metal column is estimated from the uv or x - ray spectra .",
    "we interpret this difference as the result of a dust - poor , atomic phase that is spatially separated from the highly extinguished molecular cloud",
    ". both phases of gas give rise to metal absorption ( the profiles span the estimated @xmath100 offset ; fig .",
    "[ fig : metals ] ) but we speculate that the atomic phase has a much lower dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "several lines of evidence argue against identifying this molecular cloud as the birthplace of the grb progenitor .",
    "we detect strong absorption from and transitions indicating the gas lies @xmath101pc from the grb @xcite .",
    "if the molecular gas were within @xmath102pc of the afterglow , a significant column of h@xmath0 would be excited to unbound states @xcite .",
    "we have searched for such transitions at @xmath103  and report no positive detections , setting an equivalent width limit @xmath104    ( 95@xmath105 c.l . ) . we have searched for variability in the dust opacity , absorption , and in the equivalent widths of the metal - line transitions but detect none .",
    "the most plausible scenario , therefore , is that the gas lies beyond 100pc from the afterglow , consistent with the estimate for photodissociation regions surrounding grb progenitors @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the molecular cloud identified in the afterglow spectrum of grb  080607 arises in a neighboring , star - forming region .",
    "this marks the first unambiguous detection of h@xmath0 in a grb sightline ( among six intensively searched ) and of co ( among @xmath15 sightlines ) .",
    "our results offer insight into the rarity of these detections . from our dust model",
    ", we estimate a rest - frame uv extinction of @xmath106mag .",
    "if this afterglow were just 1  mag fainter , then the lyman - werner series could not have been detected .",
    "similarly , the co bandheads would not have been observable for the majority of grbs .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that one requires an uncommonly luminous afterglow combined with a fortuitous path through an unrelated molecular cloud .",
    "we contend further that a significant fraction of the subluminous optical bursts ( also called  dark bursts  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are events like grb  080607 but with fainter intrinsic luminosity .",
    "an open and intriguing question is whether these dust - extinguished events correspond to unique host galaxies ( e.g. , intensely star forming and dusty systems ) , or whether the hosts have properties similar to the general population and the variations along individual sightlines is geometrical ( i.e. , molecular clouds have small cross - section and are rarely intersected ) .",
    "a resolution of these two effects bears on the nature of molecular gas at high redshift including its distribution and relation to star formation .",
    "a multi - wavelength survey of the hosts , including searches for co emission , may help distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "though rare , these high-@xmath11 events enable studies at optical wavebands of rest - frame uv features that serve as powerful diagnostics of star - forming regions .",
    "this includes a precise redshift for follow - up observations , for example studies of co in emission at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "indeed , the co 3 - 2 and 1 - 0 transitions lie at favorable observational frequencies .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of systems like grb  080607 would also permit searches for additional molecules in the uv ( e.g. , c@xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , such systems easily satisfy the metal - strong dla criteria of @xcite and afford a special opportunity to study rare elements in the young universe . assuming solar abundances , for example",
    ", we estimate that the  @xmath1071400 ,  @xmath1071362 , and  @xmath1071433 transitions should all have rest - frame equivalent widths exceeding 50  m .",
