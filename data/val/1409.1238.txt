    "the infrared data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ has provided invaluable insights in the field of star formation .",

    "mid - infrared bubbles trace regions of high mass star formation where bright shells of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission surround areas filled with 24 @xmath2 m dust emission @xcite . in other cases absorption of galactic background emission reveals infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) where star formation is in its earliest stages @xcite .",
    "when protostellar outflows are present , the emission from the associated shocked gas is detected in all 4 _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) bands , primarily due to a multitude of ro - vibrational molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) emission lines @xcite . in irac imaging of high mass star forming regions",
    "the presence of extended 4.5 @xmath2 m emission has been used to identify massive embedded ysos @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the irac color space for shocked h@xmath1 emission excited through h ",
    "h@xmath1 , he ",
    "h@xmath1 , and h@xmath1h@xmath1 collisions .",
    "they found the location of shocked h@xmath1 in vs. color space to be a function of gas temperature and volume density .",
    "the calculated color space for high temperature shocked gas was found to be consistent with the empirical color cut used by @xcite to distinguish between ysos and shocked emission . @xcite included emission from the co @xmath3=10 band in their calculations of the color space of shocked gas .",
    "analysis using this color space can be used to systematically search for outflows and to study their structures and interactions with environments @xcite .",
    "while h@xmath1 emission is a good tracer of shocked gas from outflows , emission from h@xmath1 can also arise from uv fluorescence in cold gas @xcite .",
    "this often occurs in photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) surrounding young high mass stars .",
    "uv radiation can have an effect on star formation ; it can either help disperse the remnant gas ending the formation of stars in the region or trigger a subsequent generation of star formation .",
    "uv fluorescent h@xmath1 emission is due to the absorption of far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons by h@xmath1 into its excited electronic states .",
    "these excited molecules will either decay into the ground electronic state continuum and disassociate or decay into discrete ro - vibrational levels of the ground electronic state and then cascade through ro - vibrational transitions giving rise to infrared photons @xcite .",
    "the resulting line ratios from the h@xmath1 fluorescent emission can often mimic those of shock heated gas .",
    "within pdrs small pah grains also absorb fuv photons and re - emit in the infrared .",
    "this pah emission is often found to be correlated with h@xmath1 emission in h@xmath1 shells surrounding pdrs @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the irac fluxes for pah emission varying radiation strength and grain size distribution . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis to include emission from h@xmath1 fluorescent emission .",
    "we calculate the irac color space for pdr regions considering geometry of the gas cloud and varying the ratio of incident fuv radiation to gas density .",
    "we create a set of color diagnostics that can be applied to study the structure of pdrs .",
    "additionally , we find that color analysis can be used to distinguish between fuv excited and shock excited h@xmath1 emission . finally , we apply these diagnostics to _ spitzer _ irac data of ngc 2316 as an example of the usefulness of this method .",
    "pdr calculations were performed with version 13.02 of cloudy , last described by @xcite .",
    "this code includes a sophisticated model of the h@xmath1 molecule described by @xcite .",
    "the code self - consistently calculates excitation , formation , dissociation , and ortho - para conversion for h@xmath1 .",
    "the calculations of the ro - vibrational level populations are performed by following the photo - excitation of h@xmath1 into excited electronic states and subsequent decay into ground state ro - vibrational levels .",
    "the code includes the ability to use pah absorption cross sections from @xcite .",
    "we used the grain size distribution of @xcite from 3.5   to 1 @xmath2 m .",
    "we considered the total c abundance in the log - normal parts of the size distribution to be @xmath4 .",
    "the charge state of a pah grain affects its opacity . @xcite",
    "provide cross sections for both neutral grains and charged grains .",
    "the current version of the cloudy code is unable to self - consistently determine the opacity of the grains from their charge state .",
    "in order to work around this limitation we run the code using an iterative process .",
    "first , an initial run of the cloudy code solved the grain ionization - recombination balance equations @xcite considering a fully neutral pah distribution in order to obtain ionization fraction distributions as a function of grain size and depth into the cloud .",
    "second , the gas cloud is divided into zones where each zone will have its own grain ionization distribution . for each zone , two separate grain size distributions were then created ; one for neutral pahs and one for ionized pahs .",
    "the code is then run again on each zone where the input radiation of that zone was the output radiation of its preceding zone .",
    "we considered a simple layout and geometry of a gas cloud to investigate the color space .",
    "the volume density of the gas was kept constant and the shape of the external fuv radiation field was set to the draine field @xcite .",
    "we ran a grid of models varying the ratio of incident fuv flux to gas density ( @xmath5 ) is in units of @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 through the range of gas density , = @xmath9@xmath10 @xmath11 . using obtained emissivities and opacities for each zone",
    ", we applied the radiative transfer equation to calculate the spectra at various lines of sight through the gas .",
    "we also investigate different gas geometries by placing slabs of constant thickness at various depths of @xmath12 = \\{0.1 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 } mag both in front of and behind the incident radiation .",
    "the resulting infrared spectra from our models were converted into irac colors using irac spectral response and calibration data @xcite .",
    "there is often degeneracy for physical parameters of emitting material in color space , thus the usefulness of color space analysis in extracting information is restricted to regions in color space that reveals breaks in degeneracy . from our investigation of the calculated irac colors , we find that the vs. color space in the region where 2.9 @xmath13 @xmath13 3.6 has minimal degeneracy and is useful as a tool for analysis .",

    "it should be noted that external foreground extinction can affect the irac colors , although this effect is not very strong due to the relative flatness of the mir extinction curve @xcite . application of most mir extinction laws result in the color to be negligibly effected by extinction @xcite .",
