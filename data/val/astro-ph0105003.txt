    "the small - scale structure of cold atomic hydrogen ( hi ) is an outstanding problem in the structure of the interstellar medium .",

    "are observed for pulsars @xcite .",
    "absorption with inferred optical depth of @xmath2 to @xmath3 in this line show apparent changes of @xmath4 to 0.1 over periods of a few months . over this period ,",
    "the motion of the pulsar typically carries the line of sight across tens of mas , or across several au , for absorbing material at a distance of a few hundred pc .",
    "the most straightforward conclusion is that the hi consists largely of cloudlets with transverse dimensions of several au , and optical depths of 0.01 to 0.1 .",
    "this leads to surprisingly dense clouds which are far from pressure equilibrium with the rest of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "small - scale structure of hi absorption has also been observed in spatially - varying absorption of extended continuum sources @xcite . in this paper",
    ", i will consider changes in pulsar absorption quantitatively using a simple model , and discuss absorption by extended continuum sources only qualitatively .",
    "i propose that the observed variations of pulsar absorption spectra arise from the interaction of interstellar scintillation with transverse gradients in doppler velocity of hi .",
    "interstellar scintillation is a well - understood phenomenon resulting from scattering by interstellar free electrons ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the observer receives scattered radiation from more than one path .",
    "differences in radio - wave path length , from small - scale fluctuations in the density of interstellar free electrons , lead to random interference and so to scintillation . at the frequency of the hi line , absorption and refraction introduce additional changes in amplitude and phase of the interfering signals .",
    "if these additional changes differ among paths , line and continuum will scintillate differently .",
    "the additional differences among paths change rapidly with frequency , across the line ; but only slowly with time .",
    "i suggest that this differing hi absorption results from a gradient in doppler velocity of the hi across the scattering disk . at a given observing frequency , absorption by hi at a range of doppler velocities in the gradient",
    "will block a strip of radiation , eliminating some of the paths that would otherwise reach the observer and contribute to the interference pattern .",
    "the location of the strip changes with frequency , blocking different paths and changing the interference pattern in different ways . to either side of the blocked strip ,",
    "resonant refraction will change the path length and change the phase along paths .",

    "will be distributed along the line of sight ; however , a single screen of phase - changing material at @xmath6 conveniently represents effects of scattering .",
    "the electric field at the observer can be represented as a kirchoff integral over the screen @xcite .",
    "the observer sees changes in the intensity of the source because of fortuitous reinforcement or cancellation of radiation from different points on the scattering screen .",
    "we suppose that the scattering is strong : in this case , phase differences between paths are many radians .",
    "we also assume that the radiation can be treated in the gaussian field approximation , in which the phase changes introduced at different points on the screen are taken to be completely uncorrelated , so that the summation of electric field from different paths at the observer has the character of a random walk . however , the argument here can be generalized to weak or refractive scattering , and to power - law or other spectra for the phase variations over the screen . in this paper",
    "i consider strong diffractive scattering , for greatest physical insight .",
    "we approximate the kirchoff integral for electric field at the observer as a phasor sum : @xmath7 the phase @xmath8 is the sum of that introduced by the scattering screen , @xmath9 , and a geometric phase from path length for the stationary phase point at @xmath10 : @xmath11 . at a stationary phase point ,",
    "the gradient of screen phase cancels the gradient of geometric phase . in the stationary phase approximation",
    "only stationary phase points contribute to the kirchoff integral .",

    "the weight of each phasor , @xmath13 , corresponds to an area on the screen .",
    "the distribution of stationary phase points , weighted by @xmath13 , is approximately a gaussian distribution , with full width at half maximum @xmath14 , in the gaussian - field approximation .",
    "the size of the region from which the observer receives radiation acts analogously to a lens , to produce a diffraction pattern with lateral scale @xmath15 in the plane of the observer .",
    "the intensity at the observer is the square modulus of electric field , @xmath16 here the subscript `` c '' indicates that the intensity is in the continuum , to distinguish it from line radiation .",
    "the intensity varies with time , with typical timescale @xmath17 , as the proper motions of pulsar and screen carry the line of sight through the scattering material at speed @xmath18 .",
    "the intensity also varies with observing frequency @xmath19 , with typical frequency scale , or `` decorrelation bandwidth , '' @xmath20 , because radiation paths that produce cancellation at one observing wavelength may reinforce at another .",
    "@xcite give precise expressions for these relations for cases of power - law spectra of density fluctuations .",
    "in strong scattering , decorrelation bandwidth is much smaller than the observing frequency . in weak scattering the bandwidth of scintillations",

    "the factor of @xmath30 arises from the fact that @xmath31 is the logarithmic decrease of intensity , rather than electric field .",
    "suppose that the hi consists of a background distribution , uniform over the screen , and a small fraction that has varying properties over the screen . within the absorption line ,",
    "the background distribution will introduce a fractional change in amplitude and a phase rotation , both uniform for all phasors .",

    "the scattering disk diameter is thus 300  au . in principle",
    ", a weak gradient of @xmath70 can produce the result .",
    "however , the scintillation bandwidth is estimated as 160  hz , and the scintillation tinescale is probably only a few seconds .",
    "thus , a single observation averages over many scintillations , and the scintillation model discussed here is unlikely to contribute in this particular case .",
    "this object represents an important exception to the relatively similar scattering properties of the other pulsars in the sample .",

    "the change in the line was very narrow in frequency , with a doppler width of @xmath73 , much smaller than the absorption linewidth of @xmath74 .",

    "table  [ theory ] shows the gradients in doppler velocity required across 1  au , for each of the pulsars with observed variability of hi absorption . for most pulsars",
    "i give a range of estimated gradients .",
    "this range includes both the variety of @xmath63 reported , and the differences among measurements of the decorrelation bandwidth . because greatest @xmath75 across the line is recorded at each epoch , and because the mean square and higher moments of the expected distribution do not converge , thesexs inferred gradients are more likely to be overestimates than underestimates .",
    "lack of accurate measurements of angular broadening also contributes to the breadth of the range .",
    "table  [ theory ] estimates angular broadening from decorrelation bandwidth as @xmath76 .",
    "this estimate is likely to be rather poor for nearby objects such as those in the table @xcite , although it is accurate to within about a factor of 2 for more strongly - scattered objects @xcite . in summary , interstellar scattering and gradients in doppler velocity of about 0.05",
    "to @xmath77 can produce the observed variations in hi absorption .      although the lengths @xmath78 are quite small , by the standard of typically observed lengths in the interstellar medium , the inferred velocity differences @xmath53 are small as well .",
    "interstellar clouds invariably support turbulent velocities of several times thermal velocity .",
    "the widths of interstellar lines are consequently greater than those resulting from temperature of the gas by a factor of 2 to 3 , tracing this turbulence @xcite . in particular , the 21-cm absorption lines of pulsars observed for studies of small - scale structure commonly have widths of 2 to 3  @xmath79 , whereas the 50 to 100  k temperature of the gas would result in doppler widths of 0.5 to 1  @xmath79 .",
    "these broader linewidths persist at even the highest angular resolutions observed .",
    "studies of the distribution of hi absorption against extended continuum sources may also be affected by scintillation , as discussed in   [ extended_source ] below .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to compare velocity gradients inferred from such studies with those required to produce small - scale structure of hi absorption for pulsars . as an example , @xcite observe a gradient of about @xmath80 across about 30  mas , toward the source 3c138 .",
    "for an absorber distance of 200  pc and a thermal velocity of @xmath81 , this corresponds to a gradient of 0.4  @xmath56/au , comparable to the largest of those inferred from the scintillation model , as shown in table  [ theory ] .",
    "comparison velocity variations in the scattering model proposed here with density variations required in the cloudlet picture is illuminating . under the assumption of rough balance between ram pressure and thermal pressure , a velocity difference @xmath53 corresponds to a density difference @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the density and @xmath84 is a typical random fluid velocity .",
    "the typical random velocity inferred from linewidth is about the thermal velocity , so @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in the scintillation model , the velocity differences of about 0.05 to @xmath86 correspond roughly to density differences of 5% to 30% across 1  au .    in the traditional cloudlet model , with spherical cloudlets ,",
    "the required density differences are of order a factor of 300 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is ameliorated if hi lies in sheets or filaments ; it is aggravated by the necessity that h@xmath87 accompany the hi .",
    "these density differences are expressed across about 30  au , the size of the clouds . in the absence of some additional confining mechanism",
    ", these clouds will evolve over the sound crossing time , or about 150  yr .",
    "it would be surprising if that evolution did not result in gradients of the sound speed across 1  au , ample to produce variations in intensity by the scattering mechanism proposed here .",
    "thus , even if discrete , dense cloudlets exist , the scattering mechanism proposed here should still play a role .",
    "small - scale structure of hi absorption due to scintillation will vary more rapidly than structure due to absorbing cloudlets .",
    "intensity variations from scintillation vary on the scintillation timescale @xmath88 .",
    "the timescale for variations from absorbing , intervening cloudlets can be no shorter than the time required for the scattering disk to move by its own width , @xmath89 , sometimes called the `` refractive timescale '' . in strong scattering , @xmath90 is much longer than @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , @xmath91 . with @xmath92 to 0.01 , as shown in table  [ scatter_obs ] most pulsars studied for small - scale variations of hi absorption are in strong scattering .",
    "exceptions are pulsars b0950@xmath2508 , which is in weak scattering and shows no absorption , and b1557@xmath2657 , which is far into strong scattering , as discussed above . for",
    "the other pulsars , observations of changes in absorption spectra on timescales @xmath50 would greatly strengthen the argument that scintillation , rather than absorbing cloudlets , is responsible for small - scale structure of the hi absorption line .",
    "a measurement of the average intensity of a scintillating source must be averaged over about 50 scintillations to produce a reproducible result , largely because a few strong scintillations dominate sums @xcite .",
    "measurements converge even more slowly near the transition between weak and strong scattering , because the fractional modulation is great , up to @xmath93 .",
    "because most pulsars in the sample have scintillation timescales of a few thousand seconds , even observations of several hours can fail to eliminate effects of scintillation by time averaging .",
    "pulsar 0540@xmath2523 is an exception .",
    "it has a scintillation timescale short enough that spectra from several contiguous scintillation timescales could be observed and compared , and much shorter than the refractive timescale .",
    "thus the timescale of variations of hi absorption for this object presents an important test of the origin of variations in hi absorption .",
    "@xcite points out that absorbing hi is likely to be distributed on a variety of length scales . as an extreme case",
    ", a large - scale gradient of optical depth will produce spectral variations over any scale large enough not to be smeared by scattering . in this case , the smallest scale showing spectral variations has nothing to do with the size of the cloud .",
    "a medium with structure on a variety of scales is most accurately described by a structure function , or equivalently , spatial spectrum .",
    "if velocity gradients in hi combine with interstellar scintillation to produce small - scale structure of the hi absorption line , the structure function of that structure will reflect different physics at large and small scales .",
    "effects of scintillation at the short length scale @xmath94  au and do not increase with further increases inlength scale .",
    "absorption by discrete clouds will become increasingly important with increasing scale , as effects of larger clouds become more important .",
    "determination of the structure function , and the point at which the underlying physics changes , will help to understand interstellar hi as well as the origin of small - scale changes in absorption spectra .      as noted above",
    ", small - scale variations of hi absorption have been observed toward several continuum sources @xcite .",
    "such sources do not scintillate , because they are large enough to quench scintillation .",
    "more precisely , the source is large enough that different parts scintillate independently and cancel out .",
    "i suggest scintillation could nevertheless explain the observed variations .",
    "many of the sources may be in weak scintillation , where the maximum source size for scintillation is relatively large , and scintillation is quenched only slowly as source size increases .",
    "moreover , the size relevant as a constraint , for resolved sources in weak scattering , is the resolution of the instrument rather than the size of the source .",
    "analogously , stars twinkle , but planets do not ; but a single point on a planet s surface does twinkle .",
    "thus , a single point on an extended radio source will show variations in hi absorption , if scattering by electron - density fluctuations and a gradient of doppler velocity of hi are present .",
    "refractive scattering can also produce variations in surface brightness of extended sources @xcite .",
    "this refractive `` mottling '' of the source is not quenched by finite source size .",
    "velocity gradients will not affect refractive scattering , unless they are very large ; however , higher - order polynomial variations can affect it",
    ". although the extension of the formalism of this paper to extended sources is straightforward in principle , description of weak and refractive scintillation requires a more complicated formalism , and i defer it to a subsequent paper .",
    "i have presented a simple model for the effects of absorption by hi with a spatially - varying opacity @xmath37 on a scintillating pulsar .",
    "the scintillation state is different on and off the line : both scintillate , but not synchronously .",
    "the bandwidth of scintillation of the continuum is set by the phase differences among different paths , and is much broader than the line ; the bandwidth of scintillation on the line is set by variations in opacity , and is typically of order the thermal linewidth .",
    "gradients in doppler velocity of the absorbing hi can produce relative scintillations of line and continuum .",
    "gradients of order 0.05 to 0.3 times the thermal velocity , across 1  au produce effects effects comparable to the observed small - scale variations of hi absorption spectra .",
    "such gradients are comparable to those inferred from observations .",
    "if discrete absorbing cloudlets produced the variation , they would result in comparable or larger gradients .",
    "the timescale of scintillation , on and off the line , is equal to the scintillation timescale , and can be much shorter than the minimum time for variations in intensity from absorbing cloudlets .",
    "this difference in timescales , and difference in structure functions , present possible observational tests of the scintillation model presented here .",
