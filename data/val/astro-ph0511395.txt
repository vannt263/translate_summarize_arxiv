    "the major change from sasv6.1 to sasv6.5 is the new response generation in _ rmfgen _ for the epic mos instruments . using sasv6.1",
    "it has been found that , starting at about rev .",
    "380 and increasing mission duration , pn and mos measurements diverge at low energies for most observations . using supernova remnants , a spatial dependency of this low energy discrepancy",
    "was discovered .",
    "further investigations reveal a change in the mos distribution behaviour at and close to the nominal bore - sight positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mospatch ] ) , whereas the redistribution outside these regions does not show any change .",
    "these spatial dependency indicate that x - ray and/or focused particle radiation changed the physical performance of the ccds .    ]",
    "the new mos response generation takes into account three time dependent regions and calculates the response according to the selected source region .",
    "using sasv6.5 the previously found low energy discrepancy , evolving with time , is corrected .",
    "examples are provided in sect .",
    "[ sect : epochs ] .",
    "a more detailed description is provided in the conference contribution of a.m.  read et al .",
    ": patching epic - mos : temporal and spatial dependency of the detector response .",
    "together with the sasv6.5 and its new mos response generation , a new set of 18 ccf - files has been published , for nine time epochs now modelling the spatial dependency by three regions for the central ccds .",
    "* warning : using sasv6.1 together with the new set of ccf - files , _ rmfgen _ could create responses with strange features . *      since revolution 961 a new hot column has appeared on mos1 ccd1 due to an impact of a micrometeorite dust particle on mos1 ccd1 .",
    "this new defect is leaking into the whole column . as a consequence ,",
    "the offset of this column is raised by about 20 adus , therefore generating a lot of noise events at low energy above the low energy threshold , and the whole column is identified as bad by embadpixfind and masked out in the calibrated event list . as this column passes a few pixels from the nominal target position on ccd1 , a significant fraction of the on - axis source psf is affected .",
    "if the selection # xmmea_em to the mos event list is applied to generate spectra of on - axis sources , only the bad column is marked bad but not the adjacent columns .",
    "this missing column is taken into account by _ arfgen _ in the computation of the effective area .    ]    if the more conservative selection flag flag==0 is used for the analysis , also the two adjacent columns are masked , therefore 3 columns are removed , causing the loss of up to 10 - 15% of the flux of an on - axis source .",
    "the sasv6.1 did not take into account these adjacent missing columns in the computation of the effective area .",
    "therefore the absolute flux / normalisation of a source was too low .",
    "the new _ arfgen _ version of sasv6.5 now takes into account these adjacent missing columns .      in sasv6.1 , the two mos pipeline tasks _ emproc _ and _ emchain _ used different routines to search for bad pixels .",
    "the first used the general task _ badpixfind _ , whereas the latter used the more advanced , to the mos data reduction adapted task _",
    "embadpixfind_. thus , the resulting mos eventlists of both pipelines could differ distinctly . in sasv6.5 , both pipeline tasks are using the _ embadpixfind _ routine to detect bad pixels and the resulting event lists of both pipeline tasks are completely equivalent now .    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    due to offset variations from column to column , the previous version of _ embadpixfind _",
    ", in rare cases , could remove single columns by flagging them bad erroneously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : embadpixfind ] , top ) . in specific observations",
    ", the central pixel of the psf could be marked as a bad pixel and removed from the event list .",
    "a new rejection algorithm prevents erroneous identifications of bad columns and pixels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : embadpixfind ] , bottom ) .",
    "x - ray spectra of blazars are expected to show a featureless continuum .",
    "spectral fits of a set of blazars show common systematic s - shape pn residuals at the low energy end of the pn best fits ( fig .",
