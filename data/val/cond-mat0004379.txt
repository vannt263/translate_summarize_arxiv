    "in this contribution we report on a new crossover phenomenon observed in the longitudinal correlation function at finite magnetic field @xmath3 and finite temperature @xmath1 of the @xmath4 spin - chain with anisotropy parameter @xmath5 .",
    "as is well known any thermodynamic quantity derived from the free energy of the one - dimensional @xmath4 model is an analytic function of finite @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "phase transitions and associated mathematical singularities may and do occur in the ground state , i.e. at @xmath6 .",
    "however , quantities not obtained from the free energy , but characterising the asymptotics of correlation functions may show `` their own '' non - analyticities _ at finite _ temperatures .",
    "indeed the @xmath4 chain in an external magnetic field does show well defined non - analyticities in the _ correlation lengths _ of the longitudinal spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "we want to point out that these crossover phenomena are a result of strong correlations and finite temperature .",
    "the crossover does not take place for the case @xmath7 corresponding to free fermions .    for the attractive regime @xmath8 of the @xmath4 chain the investigations",
    "are not yet carried out for finite field @xmath3 and finite @xmath1 . here",
    "the physical phenomena are expected to be much richer . even for the case of vanishing magnetic field",
    "@xmath9 a sequence of crossovers ( commensurate - incommensurate - commensurate ) for an increase of @xmath1 from 0 to @xmath10 was found @xcite .",
    "the method we apply ( as that used in @xcite ) is based on a mapping of the @xmath4 chain at finite temperatures onto a classical model in two dimensions and the formulation of a suitable quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) describing the transfer along the chain .",
    "the spectrum of the qtm succumbs to a bethe ansatz ( ba ) treatment and the corresponding ba equations can be cast into the form of non - linear integral equations .",
    "crossover phenomena of correlation lengths manifest themselves as level crossings of next - leading eigenvalues of the qtm . at finite field @xmath0 and sufficiently high temperature",
    "the relevant eigenvalues for the longitudinal correlation functions are 1-string and 2-string solutions ( both solutions belong to the @xmath11 sector of the model ) .",
    "the truely next - leading eigenvalue is unique and given by the 1-string solution to the qtm taking real and negative values thus resulting into exponentially decaying correlations with antiferromagnetic oscillations . in some sense at sufficiently high temperature",
    "the properties of the system are determined by the longitudinal ( `` classical '' ) terms of the hamiltonian , i.e. the @xmath12 coupling and the field in @xmath13 direction , which dominate over the transversal exchange ( `` quantum mechanical '' ) terms . at sufficiently low temperature",
    "a different behavior is expected on grounds of predictions by conformal field theory ( cft)@xcite . in particular , correlations with incommensurate @xmath14 oscillations are expected@xcite . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the qtm has to develop complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "this scenario has not been investigated before .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to present the first `` bethe ansatz '' study of this crossover phenomenon and to provide reasonably accurate values for the crossover temperature @xmath15 .",
    "as pointed out already , for the free fermion case @xmath16 , i.e. the crossover does not take place . in physical terms this may be understood in the way that due to the absence of longitudinal couplings the longitudinal terms never dominate over the transversal terms .",
    "this report is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce some basic definitions of the @xmath4 chain and present its properties at low temperature as obtained within conformal field theory ( cft ) . in sec .",
    "3 the approach to thermodynamic properties by use of a lattice path integral formulation and the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) is reviewed .",
    "in particular the set of non - linear integral equations for the two auxiliary functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponding to the energy density functions of spinons with spin @xmath19 are given . in sec .",
    "4 numerical results are given for the correlation length and fermi momentum of the longitudinal spin - spin correlation function . finally , the particle - hole picture resulting at low temperatures is discussed",
    ". a complete exposition of how this is related to the dressed charge formulation of cft will appear in @xcite .",

    "the system is in one of three phases . for anisotropy parameter @xmath24",
    "we have two ordered phases and for @xmath25 a critical phase . in the latter case",
    "the anisotropy parameter is conveniently parameterized by @xmath26 . in the following we take @xmath27 ( repulsive regime ) for simplicity .",
    "the excitations are gapless spinons with spin @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 at zero temperature the spin correlations decay algebraically@xcite , with exponents depending on the magnetic field in a nontrivial way @xcite . at finite temperature",
    "the correlations decay exponentially @xmath31 with in general different correlation lengths @xmath32 for different correlation functions . at low temperatures",
    "the correlation lengths can be related by conformal mappings to the scaling dimensions @xmath33 of the fields at @xmath6 @xmath34 the scaling dimensions @xmath33 are calculated from finite size corrections to the energy levels of the hamiltonian and scaling predictions by cft @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are integers labelling the conformal tower .",
    "the critical exponents of the spin-1/2 @xmath4 model are those of a @xmath38 gaussian theory . at zero magnetic field",
