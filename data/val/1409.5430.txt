    "the central puzzle of the hole - doped cuprates at low doping is the origin of the  pseudogap \"  a suppression in the density of states at the fermi - level below a temperature , @xmath3 and its relation to other symmetry - broken states found at lower temperatures .",
    "most notably , recent experiments on a number of different families of the hole - doped cuprates have detected the onset of an incommensurate charge density wave ( cdw ) state at a temperature , @xmath4 which competes with superconductivity below the superconducting @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one of the primary motivations behind investigating the nature of the cdw is the hope that a better understanding of this state would lead to a better understanding of the  normal \" state above @xmath5 out of which it emerges .",
    "a number of recent theoretical works @xcite have tried to approach this problem from a weak - coupling approach , where the cdw is interpreted as an instability of a large fermi surface in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange interactions .",
    "there are two fundamental properties associated with a cdw its wavevector , @xmath6 , and its form factor , @xmath7 ,  where the cdw is expressed in real space as a bond - observable , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 annihilates an electron on the cu site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 ) given by p_ij=_e^i(_i+_j)/2 .",
    "[ dij ] conventional charge density waves have only on - site charge modulation with @xmath7 independent of @xmath12 ; this is not the case in the context of the cuprates .",
    "the experiments on certain families of the cuprates , such as ybco , bscco and na - ccoc , have found strong evidence for the wavevector @xmath6 to be of the form : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 decreases with increasing hole - doping and is believed to nest portions of a putative large fermi surface in the vicinity of , but away from , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , recent phase - sensitive stm experiments @xcite and other x - ray measurements @xcite have unveiled the form factor @xmath7 to be predominantly of a @xmath18wave nature , @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "hence , the cdw should be more appropriately referred to as a  bond density \" wave ( bdw ) .",
    "fig.[bdw ] provides an illustration of unidirectional bdws of different types in real space for both commensurate as well as incommensurate wavevectors .",
    "we note in passing that recent x - ray observations @xcite in the la - based cuprates indicate a dominant @xmath21-form factor ( where @xmath22 ) , and this has been ascribed to the presence of magnetic ` stripe ' order in these compounds , and is in agreement with computations in such states @xcite .",
    "further , computations @xcite of density wave instabilities in the presence of commensurate antiferromagnetism show suppression of the @xmath1-form factor with increasing magnetic order .    , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "( a)-(c ) we plot the charge modulation for a commensurate wavevector , @xmath25 , while ( d)-(f ) plot the same quantity for an incommensurate wavevector , @xmath26 .",
    "the parameters used are : ( a ) , ( d ) @xmath27 .",
    "( b ) , ( e ) @xmath28 .",
    "( c ) , ( f ) @xmath29 .",
    "we have included phases in the definitions of @xmath30 in order to make the charge distribution ",
    "bond - centered \" for the case of the commensurate wavevector ; however , other choices of the phases are also allowed . ]    without magnetic ordering , the form factor does indeed come out to be predominantly @xmath18wave within all the weak - coupling approaches @xcite .",
    "however , the wavevector of the leading density - wave instability within all of these approaches is always of the diagonal type , @xmath2 .",
    "this feature can be traced back to the absence of a pre - existing gap in the anti - nodal region of the large fermi surface normal state .",
    "it is also related to the remnant of an emergent su(2 ) symmetry associated with afm exchange interactions , that maps particles to holes and vice versa @xcite ; therefore @xmath18wave superconductivity , which is the leading instability in the problem , gets mapped to @xmath18form factor bdw with the diagonal wavevectors . while the diagonal wavevector is a serious drawback of the weak - coupling approaches ,",
    "various scenarios have been proposed under which the experimentally observed state might be favored over the diagonal state @xcite .    here",
    "we shall explore the consequences of gapping out the anti - nodal region by examining the density wave instabilities of a metallic state denoted @xcite the fractionalized fermi liquid ( fl * ) .",
    "an independent related analysis has been carried recently by zhang and mei @xcite using the yang - rice - zhang ( yrz ) ansatz @xcite for the fractionalized metal .",
    "the fl * has similarities to the yrz ansatz @xcite , but as we shall review below , can be derived systematically from microscopic models while keeping careful track of its ` topological ' order @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "these density wave instabilities were also discussed in refs .  , but without allowance for non - trivial form factors for the density wave .",
    "fl * phases are most conveniently described within multi - band models , such as in kondo lattice models for heavy - fermion systems @xcite or emery - type models suited for the cuprates , where the spins in only one of the bands go into a quantum - disordered ( spin - liquid ) state . in this work",
    ", we shall take a different route that has been adopted earlier in refs.@xcite .",
    "this approach is best understood as follows @xcite : imagine that we start from a metal with long - range afm order , so that the fermi surface has been reconstructed into hole - pockets .",
    "if we now want to describe the loss of antiferromagnetism , then the transitions where the long - range order is lost and the entire fermi surface is recovered need not be coincident .",
    "in particular , it is possible to have two separate transitions , where at the first transition the _ orientational _ order of the afm is lost over long distances , while the magnitude of the afm order remains fixed ; the large fermi surface is recovered at the second transition . therefore , it is possible to have an intermediate phase with a locally well - defined afm order ( over distances of the order of a short correlation length , @xmath31 ) . as we will review below",
    ", this intermediate phase can have hole pockets . because there is no broken symmetry , the luttinger theorem on the fermi surface volume",
    "is violated , but this is permitted because of the presence of topological order @xcite .    , which controls the strength of quantum fluctuations and the carrier density , @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 phases are insulators , and we assume that the insulator has a deconfined quantum critical point @xcite at a @xmath34 . the arrows on the labels of the phases indicate crossovers upon going to lower energies and longer distances . for @xmath33 and @xmath35 , the ground state is an ordered antiferromagnetic insulator , while for @xmath33 and @xmath36 the ground state is a valence bond solid ( vbs ) , which arises as an instability at long confinement scale of a u(1 ) spin - liquid ( sl ) .",
    "the @xmath34 , deconfined quantum critical point , broadens into a  holon \" metal phase above a small , finite @xmath32 .",
    "binding of the emergent spinon and holon excitations in the holon metal phase leads to the fl * phase shown for @xmath36 and non - zero @xmath32 .",
    "we do not discuss the small @xmath32 ( shaded grey ) region in this paper @xcite .",
    "the bdw instabilities of the u(1 ) fl * have a @xmath18form factor and could be relevant for the observations in the non la - based cuprates .",
    "the physical trajectory in the phase diagram ( for the non - la cuprates ) corresponds to not only changing @xmath32 , but also @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ the trajectory runs diagonally .",
    "the eventual confinement transition out of the @xmath18bdw state must occur , and its description remains an important topic for future work . ]    in the context of one - band models linked to the physics of the cuprates , our realization of the fl * state is linked to the analysis presented in ref .  .",
    "we used their and subsequent results @xcite to obtain the global phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ phases ] .",
    "the starting point of this phase diagram is a deconfined quantum critical point @xcite in the antiferromagnet at zero doping , while tuning a coupling constant @xmath37 , which measures the degree of  frustration \" in the antiferromagnet .",

    "the vector @xmath58 satisfies the local constraint @xmath59 .    when @xmath35 , the above model has long - range antiferromagnetic order , @xmath60 ( with a correlation length , @xmath61 ) . in the presence of such long - range order ( lro ) , the large fermi surface breaks up into electron and hole pockets .",
    "the resulting state in the presence of short - range fermionic interactions could be unstable to other symmetry - broken states ; the nature of these instabilities in the particle - hole channel , starting from a reconstructed fermi surface , have been analyzed @xcite . as we noted in section  [ intro ] , this approach leads to density waves with the @xmath1-form factor suppressed @xcite , consistent with recent observations on the la - based cuprates @xcite which do have magnetic order at low temperatures .",
    "our interest in the present paper is on the @xmath62 portion of the phase diagram in fig .",

    ", there is an ` orthogonality catastrophe ' and each @xmath41 fermion is effectively localized by the critical fluctuations .",
    "we are not interested here in the very small values of @xmath32 at which this localization happens , and so will not discuss it further ; it is also excluded from fig .

    "let us now turn to @xmath36 .",
    "now there is at least one additional length scale , the spin correlation length , @xmath31 .",
    "this length should be compared with the spacing between the holons @xmath66 .",
    "there is actually another significant scale , the length scale at which landau - damping of the photon sets in ; this also diverges as @xmath67 , and for simplicity we will ignore its difference from the spacing between the holons .",
    "when @xmath68 , we revert to the @xmath34 situation described in the previous paragraph .",

    "the remaining features in the @xmath128 phase diagram remain identical to the earlier results shown in fig.[lambq_j](b ) .",
    "we investigate the nature of the instabilities for two more cases in appendix [ coulomb ] , when @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the nature of the leading instabilities in these two cases is different ; in the first case it is a  staggered - flux \" state ( though away from @xmath131 ) that breaks time reversal symmetry , while in the second case it leads to a conventional charge - density wave at @xmath131 .",
    "however , within the region of small @xmath132 of interest to us here , there remains a local instability to a @xmath1-form factor density wave with wavevectors of the form @xmath133 and @xmath134 , similar to those found above .",
    "we have argued here that the incommensurate charge density wave state in the underdoped cuprates acts as a window into the exotic  normal \" phase out of which it emerges .",
    "the traditional weak - coupling computations that start with a large fermi surface give rise to a density wave instability with diagonal wavevectors of the form @xmath2 , which is in disagreement with the experimental observations . a promising candidate for the normal state of the underdoped cuprates",
    "is a u(1)-fl * , where the electrons are coupled to the fractionalized excitations of a quantum fluctuating antiferromagnet . in this paper , we have investigated the charge - ordering instabilities of such a fl * state , and have identified the leading instability of the fl * state in the particle - hole channel . in most of the cases considered here , this leads to a @xmath18form factor bond density wave with wavevectors of the form @xmath135 , where @xmath15 is related to a geometric property of the fermi surfaces of the fl * state .",
    "moreover , as a function of increasing doping , as the size of the hole - pockets increase , the magnitude of the wavevector that nests the tips of the pockets decreases .",
    "this agrees with the trend that has been seen in experiments , where the bdw wavector is a decreasing function of the increasing hole - doping @xcite .",
    "while the identification of the correct bdw starting from a more exotic normal state is an interesting result , there are other implications at low temperatures of having a parent fl*. the vanilla fl * state has hole pockets with non - zero ( but small ) photoemission intensity on the ` back side ' _ i.e. _ outside the first antiferromagnetic brillouin zone , and the photoemission observations of ref .",
    "have been argued to be consistent with this .",
    "however , the superconducting state descending from such a fl * metal has 8 nodal points @xcite , and no signs of such a feature have been experimentally detected .",
    "but , it should be noted that u(1)-fl * is ultimately unstable to confinement , because in the absence of fermions carrying the u(1 ) gauge charge , monopoles must proliferate at large enough scales .",
    "it is expected that this crossover to confinement will resolve the experimental conflicts of the fl * state . moreover , with the presence of an incommensurate bdw , there are no issues with the conventional luttinger theorem , and so the crossover to confinement can happen without the need for further symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , we note implications for experiments on the cuprates in high magnetic fields . in the light of the above results",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate how the bdw derived from an fl * evolves as a function of magnetic field , and in particular , determine its relation to the observed quantum oscillations at intermediate and high fields @xcite .",
    "computations starting from a large fermi surface in the presence of long - range charge order show a nodal electron - pocket @xcite and the more recently discovered hole - pockets @xcite ; it is not implausible that similar results will also be obtained starting from u(1)-fl * , especially after the crossover to confinement has been accounted for . moreover , in the fl * framework the full large fermi surface is never recovered , because even in the absence of charge order the spin liquid suppresses much of the fermi surface : this may be a way of reconciling with thermodynamic measurements of the specific - heat @xcite and the spin - susceptibility @xcite .",
