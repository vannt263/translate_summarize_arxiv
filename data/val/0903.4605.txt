    "configuration interaction ( ci ) approaches play an important role for the description of quantum many - body systems in many different areas of modern physics , ranging from atomic and molecular physics and quantum chemistry to condensed matter and nuclear physics .",
    "well known examples for ci - type methods from the different fields include the full and truncated configuration interaction methods for the many - electron problem in molecular physics and quantum chemistry @xcite , the exact diagonalization approaches for heisenberg- or hubbard - type problems in condensed matter theory @xcite , or the diagonalization shell model or general configuration - mixing approaches in nuclear structure physics @xcite .",
    "the basic framework of all of these methods is the same : within a model space spanned by a set of many - body states , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are determined through a large - scale numerical solution of the matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "the many - body states forming the basis of the model space are often slater determinants of a set of single - particle states .",
    "the basic parameter which determines the difficulty and computational cost of such calculations is the dimension @xmath4 of the many - body model space , i.e. , the linear size of the hamilton matrix .",
    "if the full eigenspectrum is required , then exact numerical diagonalizations are routinely performed for dimensions up to @xmath5 nowadays",
    ". often only a few eigenstates are of interest , such that lanczos - type algorithms provide a very efficient tool and expand the domain of tractable model - space dimensions to @xmath6 @xcite and possibly @xmath7 through massive parallelization @xcite .",
    "we consider applications which require only one or few low - lying eigenstates . in those cases",
    "the model space often contains a significant number of basis states that contribute to the basis expansion of the target eigenstates with extremely small or vanishing amplitudes .",
    "if these basis states would be omitted from the outset , the target eigenstates obtained by a solution of the eigenvalue problem in the truncated space and all observables derived from them would change only little .",
    "the diagonalization in the truncated space gives a variational approximation to the full eigenstates whose quality is directly controlled by the threshold on the amplitudes used to identify the important basis states . in order to exploit this idea",
    ", we need a way to estimate the amplitudes of the individual basis states without actually solving the full eigenvalue problem .",
    "this can be done in the framework of many - body perturbation theory , using the amplitudes for the first - order perturbative correction of an initial approximation for the target states as an importance measure @xcite .",
    "this is the concept of the importance truncation scheme discussed in this paper .",
    "we will focus on the nuclear many - body problem in the framework of a large - scale shell - model approach .",
    "however , all of the conceptual developments are generic and can be applied to any ci - type many - body method for other quantum systems as well .",
    "for the nuclear many - body problem , we aim at an exact _ ab initio _",
    "solution for a hamiltonian including a realistic nuclear interaction . in this context , the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) is the most successful ci - type method at present @xcite",
    ". the model space of the ncsm is spanned by slater determinants constructed from harmonic - oscillator single - particle states with an upper limit on the unperturbed excitation energy of the many - body basis states of @xmath1 .",
    "a unique advantage of the @xmath1 truncation is the possibility to separate intrinsic and center - of - mass degrees of freedom and thus to obtain translationally invariant intrinsic states .",
    "the ncsm is able to provide a complete description of the ground and low - lying excited states including all relevant observables , like energies , transition matrix elements , form - factors and densities .",
    "it has been applied very successfully to nuclei up to mass @xmath8 using realistic hamiltonians involving two- and three - nucleon interactions , e.g. the modern interactions derived within chiral effective field theory @xcite .",
    "a similar set of observables and nuclei is accessible in green s function monte carlo calculations @xcite which , however , are restricted to certain classes of local interactions .",
    "coupled - cluster methods , which have recently been used in connection with chiral two - nucleon interactions , have provided predictions also for heavier closed - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "the range of applicability of the ncsm is limited solely by the combinatorial growth of the model space with particle number @xmath9 and energy truncation @xmath1 . for @xmath0",
    "the model space dimension reaches the order @xmath10 already for @xmath11 , which is typically not sufficient to obtain results that are converged with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "since the model - space dimension is its only crucial limitation , the ncsm provides the optimal framework for implementing the importance truncation idea @xcite . as we will discuss in detail",
    ", the importance truncated no - core shell model ( it - ncsm ) obtained in this way extends the ncsm to a much larger domain in @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : its ] we discuss the general elements of the importance truncation scheme that can be employed in any ci - type calculation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : itncsm ] we combine these elements with the ncsm and discuss the basic properties of the it - ncsm . in secs .",
    "[ sec : app ] and [ sec : app2 ] we present a series of large - scale benchmark calculations in the it - ncsm for ground states of different closed- and open - shell nuclei up to @xmath0 and compare to the results of the full ncsm . throughout this work we restrict ourselves to a regime where full ncsm calculation are still possible to some extent so that a detailed assessment of the importance truncation is possible .",
    "consider a quantum many - body system whose ground and excited states shall be determined by solving the eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian in a large model space . the nuclear shell model is a typical example : the model space is spanned by a set of slater determinants of harmonic oscillator single - particle states and the lowest few eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the hamilton matrix are determined .",
    "similar configuration interaction ( ci ) methods are used throughout many fields of physics and chemistry .    in all of these methods",
    "the many - body model space is constructed in a combinatorial fashion with some global truncation . in the no - core shell model in nuclear physics",
    "the model space is spanned by all possible slater determinants constructed from harmonic oscillator single - particle states with total excitation energies up to @xmath1 . in a full configuration interaction calculation in quantum chemistry",
    "the model space is spanned by all slater determinants that can be constructed from a given finite set of single - particle orbitals .",
    "these global truncations do not account for the specific features of the hamiltonian and the physical properties of the state one is interested in . as a result",
    "the model space contains a substantial number of basis states which are irrelevant for the description of a specific eigenstate , e.g. , the ground state .",
    "the basic goal of the importance truncation scheme is to identify the important configurations for the description of one or a set of target states using the information provided by the hamiltonian .",
    "only the important states are selected to construct a new , greatly reduced model - space in which the eigenvalue problem is eventually solved .",
    "these importance selection ideas have been pioneered in quantum chemistry in the 1970s leading to a number of different computational schemes ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : its_othermethods ] ) .",
    "the crucial ingredient is an _ a priori _ measure for the importance of individual basis states .",
    "one possible framework to construct a simple importance measure is low - order multi - reference or multiconfigurational perturbation theory as discussed in the following section .",
    "though the following is applicable to all types of configuration interaction approaches , we will employ the language of the nuclear shell model for convenience .",
    "we start from a full model space @xmath13 spanned by a set of many - body basis states @xmath14for example the harmonic - oscillator slater determinants of the shell model with some model - space truncation .",
    "furthermore we assume a reference state @xmath15 being a zeroth - order approximation for the eigenstate of the hamiltonian we are interested in , e.g. , the ground state . in general , the reference state can be a superposition of basis states from a subspace @xmath16 of the full model space @xmath17 this initial approximation can be obtained , e.g. , from a previous ci calculation for a smaller space . in the simplest case",
    "the reference space can be one - dimensional and the reference state is given by a single basis state @xmath18 corresponding , e.g. , to the ground state of a closed shell nucleus in an independent - particle shell model .",
    "now we would like to use many - body perturbation theory to estimate the leading corrections to the reference state @xmath19 resulting from states outside of the reference space .",
    "formally this requires the use of multireference or multiconfigurational perturbation theory ( mcpt ) as it is widely applied in quantum chemistry @xcite .    for setting up the perturbation series we have to split the full hamiltonian @xmath20 into an unperturbed part @xmath21 and a perturbation @xmath22 .",
    "since we want to start from the reference state @xmath19 as an unperturbed state , the unperturbed hamiltonian has to be chosen such that @xmath23 with an eigenvalue @xmath24 given by the expectation value with the full hamiltonian @xmath20 @xmath25 formally , we can write the unperturbed hamiltonian which satisfies the eigenvalue relation as @xmath26 for simplicity , contributions from states within @xmath16 which are orthogonal to @xmath15 have been left out , since they will not contribute later on .",
    "the unperturbed energies @xmath27 for basis states outside of the reference space @xmath16 which enter into the definition of the unperturbed hamiltonian can be chosen freely .",
    "this choice of the unperturbed energies  and thus of the partitioning of the hamiltonian  has an impact on the convergence behavior of the perturbation series and a number of different possibilities have been studied in this respect @xcite . in the simplest mller - plesset - type formulation of mcpt",
    "the unperturbed energies are defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the excitation energy of the basis state @xmath14 computed at the level of the independent - particle picture , i.e. using the single - particle energies of the underlying basis .",
    "when using a harmonic - oscillator basis , the single - particle energies are just the harmonic - oscillator energies @xmath30 .",
    "when working with a hartree - fock single - particle basis , these are the hartree - fock single - particle energies .",
    "alternatively , in an epstein - nesbet partitioning , the unperturbed energies of states outside of the reference space are defined via the expectation value of the full hamiltonian @xmath31 which appears to be a more natural choice , but does not guarantee better convergence @xcite . for the present application computational efficiency",
    "is the prime concern , therefore the simple mller - plesset - type partitioning is more appropriate and will be used eventually ( cf .",
    "[ sec : itncsm_importancemeasure ] ) .",
    "once the unperturbed hamiltonian is fixed , the perturbation @xmath22 is defined via @xmath32 and we can easily write out the lowest orders of the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series . for the energy the zeroth and first - order contributions read @xmath33 as a direct consequence of our definition of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the second - order contribution to the energy assumes the well known form @xmath34 where we have used that all matrix elements of @xmath21 between @xmath15 and the basis states @xmath35 outside the reference space vanish by construction .    for the many - body states ,",
    "the zeroth - order contribution is just given by the initial reference state @xmath36 the first - order correction is given by @xmath37 in all of these expressions we can insert the expansion of the reference state @xmath15 in terms of the basis states .",
    "obviously , all these relations reduce to ordinary many - body perturbation theory when dealing which a reference state that is given by a single basis state , i.e. for @xmath38 .    in the following ,",
    "mcpt serves two important purposes : ( _ i _ ) it provides an efficient way to assess the importance of individual basis states outside of the reference space @xmath16 and will thus be the main ingredient in the importance truncation scheme .",
    "( _ ii _ ) it allows for a direct computation of corrections to the energy obtained by an initial shell - model calculation in a limited reference space @xmath16 , induced by states outside of this simple space .",
    "the central element of the importance truncation scheme is an _ a priori _ measure for the relevance of individual basis states @xmath14 for the description of a specific eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "the target state is represented by an initial approximation , the reference state @xmath15 , that carries the correct quantum numbers .",
    "based on this reference state , multiconfigurational perturbation theory provides a natural framework for assessing the importance of basis states outside of the reference space @xmath16 .",
    "a simple yet efficient importance measure can be constructed from the expression for the lowest - order correction to the unperturbed , i.e. , reference state @xmath15 .",
    "the amplitudes of the individual basis states @xmath39 in the perturbative correction provide a dimensionless measure for the relevance of those states .",
    "thus we can use the perturbative amplitudes to define an _ a priori _ importance measure : @xmath40 only those basis states with an importance measure @xmath41 larger than a threshold value @xmath42 are included in the importance - truncated model space .",
    "this space is tailored for an optimal description of the target state for the given hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast to truncation schemes based on global energy cuts , the importance truncation criterion is directly governed by the hamiltonian and the target state .",
    "the importance threshold @xmath42 controls the size of the model space and will later on be varied to investigate the dependence of the observables on the truncation .    by construction ,",
    "the importance measure @xmath43 characterizes the basis states with regard to their relevance for the description of the eigenstate .",
    "this is not the only possible choice .",
    "one can define a corresponding importance measure for identifying the basis states which are most relevant for the description of the energy .",
    "using the contributions of the individual basis states to the lowest - order correction to the energy we can define the energy - based importance measure @xmath44 since we are aiming at an optimum approximation to the eigenstate , which is then used for computing various observables other than the energy , the state - based importance measure @xmath43 is conceptually superior and will be used in the following . in practice both measures lead to very similar results though the dimensionless state - based importance measure is easier to handle ( cf .",
    "[ sec : itncsm_importancemeasure ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that for a two - body hamiltonian the importance weight @xmath45 ( as well as @xmath46 ) vanishes whenever the basis state @xmath14 differs from all of the states in the reference space by more than two single - particle states .",
    "if we start from a single slater - determinant as reference state , @xmath15 , then only @xmath47 and @xmath48-excited states with respect to this determinant can yield non - zero matrix elements for @xmath20 and thus non - vanishing @xmath45 . in order to access @xmath49 and @xmath50-excited states directly , the second - order perturbative corrections to the amplitude would have to be used .",
    "this shows that the construction of the importance truncation via perturbation theory naturally entails a hierarchy of @xmath51 states .",
    "only @xmath47 and @xmath48 excitations of @xmath15 contribute to the leading - order correction , @xmath49 and @xmath50 excited states first appear in the next - to - leading - order , and so on . in order to avoid the computationally demanding evaluation of higher - orders of perturbation theory we embed the first - order importance measure into an iterative scheme for the construction of the importance truncated space as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : its_modelspace ] .",
    "although we focus on the description of a single eigenstate , the concept of the importance truncation can easily be generalized to the simultaneous description of several eigenstates .",
    "starting from a set of a few reference states @xmath52 , we construct separate importance measures @xmath53 for each reference state . the corresponding basis state @xmath14 is included into the importance truncated space if one of the importance measures @xmath53 exceeds the threshold @xmath42 , i.e. if the basis state contributes with a sizable amplitude to at least one of the target states . in this way",
    ", we obtain a model space tailored for the simultaneous description of all target states .      since the importance measure constructed within lowest - order perturbation theory",
    "can only be used to extend the reference space by @xmath47 and @xmath48 excitations , we adopt an iterative procedure to construct the importance truncated model space for a given threshold @xmath42 . here",

    "an estimate for the energy contribution of basis states with non - vanishing importance measure @xmath72 , i.e. those that were excluded from the importance truncated space @xmath71 for given threshold @xmath42 , can be obtained from the second - order energy correction .",
    "one can simply add the individual energy contributions of the basis states @xmath73 : @xmath74 this amounts to adding the energy - importance measures @xmath75 defined in eq . for the excluded configurations . evaluating this correction during the construction of the importance truncated space",
    "does not generate any additional computational effort since the time - consuming matrix element has to be computed anyway for the importance measure @xmath43 .",
    "generally , the correction @xmath76 provides only a rough estimate for the contribution of excluded states to the energy , since only the coupling to the reference state @xmath15 is considered but not the coupling to the majority of other basis states in @xmath71 .",

    "this correction is almost the same as a full iteration of the model - space update because of the complexity of the reference state .",
    "reference thresholds and extrapolation techniques can be employed to speed up the calculations also in this case .",
    "simpler methods for estimating the effects of higher - order @xmath51 configurations are used in the context of truncated ci calculations in quantum chemistry @xcite . due to their additional benefit of restoring size extensivity in truncated ci calculations",
    "they are commonly referred to as size - extensivity corrections @xcite .",
    "the simplest class of corrections are the single- or multi - reference davidson corrections @xcite , which exist in a number of different formulations . in the language of quantum chemistry",
    ", a correction to the energy obtained in the second iteration corresponds to a multi - reference situation , where the eigenvector of the first iteration @xmath59}}\\rangle}}$ ] defines the reference state and the second iteration includes singles and doubles excitations on top of this reference state .",
    "out of the different forms of multi - reference davidson ( mrd ) corrections we use the so - called davidson - silver or siegbahn form @xcite , which can be constructed in the context of perturbation theory , @xmath84 where @xmath85 } - e^{[1]}$ ] is the difference of the ci energies obtained in the second and the first iteration and @xmath86 } } |c^{[2]}_{\\nu}|^2\\ ] ] is the total weight with which the configurations in @xmath56}$ ] , i.e. those that were already present in the first iteration , contribute to the eigenstate after the second iteration .",

    "for each value of the importance threshold @xmath42 we can extract the correction @xmath87 using the energies and amplitudes of the two last iterations . eventually the mrd correction is also extrapolated to vanishing threshold @xmath77 .      already at this stage",
    "we can identify a few general properties of the importance truncated ci , which do not depend on the details of the physical system or the model space under consideration .",
    "first of all , it is a strictly variational approach .",
    "since we determine energies always from a solution of an eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian in a restricted space , the lowest eigenvalue always provides an upper bound for the exact ground state energy .",
    "moreover , the hylleraas - undheim theorem @xcite applies , i.e. , the energy of all states is guaranteed to drop monotonically with decreasing @xmath42 and is bounded from below by the exact eigenvalue @xmath88 in the full model space : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the @xmath91th energy eigenvalue obtained in the importance truncated space @xmath71 .",
    "one can view the whole importance - truncated ci scheme as a variational calculation with an iteratively improved linear trial state .",
    "the set of states from which the trial state is constructed as a linear superposition , is selected using the importance measure based on a previous approximation of the target state .",
    "second , the iterative construction of the importance truncated model space will recover the full model space in the limit @xmath92 after @xmath93 iterations , where @xmath94 is the maximum @xmath51 excitation possible in the full model space , when starting with a single basis determinant as initial reference . as we will discuss in the context of the ncsm , more elaborate choices of the reference state will guarantee that this holds even after a single iteration .",
    "together with the monotonous behavior of the energy , this limiting property provides the foundation for an _ a posteriori _ extrapolation of the energies for different importance thresholds towards @xmath77 .",
    "third , the importance measure is constructed to identify states based on their contribution to the expansion of the eigenstates and not based on their effect on the energies .",
    "thus the importance truncation using @xmath43 is tailored to generate an optimal approximation for the eigenstates in a limited model space .",
    "the energy can be computed from the eigenstates just like any other observable of interest .",
    "therefore , from the conceptual point of view , all observables are accessible with the same precision as the energy .    finally , an interesting and nontrivial question that was raised in refs .",
    "@xcite and addressed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite concerns the size extensivity of importance - truncated ci calculations . in simple terms ,",
    "size extensivity requires that the energy obtained in a many - body calculation for a system composed of two non - interacting subsystems is equal to the sum of the energies obtained in separate calculations for the individual subsystems .",
    "whereas full ci is size extensive , a truncation of the space at some fixed @xmath51 excitation level destroys size extensivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , importance truncated ci calculations based on very few iterations of the model - space update discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : its_modelspace ] can violate size extensivity . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite a computationally simple way to restore approximate size extensivity are davidson - type corrections as given by eq . .",
    "in most cases the effect of these corrections is small already after two iterative updates of the importance truncated space ( cf .",
    "[ sec : app_o16 ] ) .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of iterations , i.e. once the model - space updates have converged , these size - extensivity corrections vanish altogether .",
    "this is in line with the fact , that after @xmath95 iterations at most the importance truncated ci recovers the full model space in the limit @xmath92 and thus would be manifestly size extensive .",
    "although the limit of vanishing thresholds is realized only through an extrapolation , we can nevertheless presume that the importance truncated ci provides an approximately size - extensive result after convergence of the model - space updates and threshold extrapolation , simply because it provides an approximation of full ci without any explicit @xmath51 truncation .",
    "the idea of an importance selection was pioneered in quantum chemistry . already in the late 1960s and early 1970s",
    "perturbative importance measures and thresholds were used to facilitate large - scale ci calculations @xcite . in a set of seminal papers buenker and",
    "peyerimhoff @xcite introduced a configuration - selecting multi - reference double - excitation ci approach ( mrd - ci ) , which is one of the benchmark methods in quantum chemistry up to today .",
    "it starts from a multi - configurational reference space and adds individual singles and doubles excitations employing a selection criterion based on the energy - lowering capability of the new configuration .",
    "the latter can be quantified either by using the perturbative second - order energy contribution or by explicitly evaluating the change of the energy eigenvalue obtained from adding the respective configuration .",
    "a threshold value on this energy - lowering is used to select the important configurations which are then included in the model space . already in the initial applications of this mrd - ci scheme in refs .",
    "@xcite , powerful threshold extrapolation techniques were employed to correct for the effects of excluded configurations ( cf .",
    "[ sec : itncsm_thresholdextrapol ] ) .",
    "moreover , size - extensivity corrections as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : its_corrections ] can be considered .",
    "essentially all conceptual elements of the it - ci scheme",
    "are already present in the mrd - ci ( although we learned of the mrd - ci only after @xcite was published ) . one difference , however , lies in the iterative setup we adopt for the it - ci which allows for a systematic improvement of the importance - truncated space .",
    "whereas the mrd - ci is typically implemented as a one - step calculation , the idea of an iterative improvement of the model space has also been used in quantum chemistry .",
    "an example is the cipsi method @xcite which uses a ci calculation for a limited model space of important configurations and supplements it with a second - order perturbative correction for singles and doubles excitations on top of the ci model space .",
    "the ci space is then iteratively enlarged by including those singles and doubles which contribute to the first - order perturbed states with amplitudes larger than a threshold value .",
    "also this cipsi scheme contains many of the relevant ideas employed in the it - ci .    since these early formulations a large number of new implementations and variations of the aforementioned importance - selection ideas have been developed @xcite and are being used for the _ ab initio _ description of highly correlated problems in quantum chemistry .    in nuclear physics",
    "the use of importance - selection techniques is not as far developed as in quantum chemistry .",
