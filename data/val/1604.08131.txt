    "during last few years the icecube experiment has detected tens of high - energy astrophysical neutrinos from 10 @xmath4 to a few @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this outstanding observation result has led to a wide debate about the origin of these neutrinos , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . among various source models ,",
    "the most commonly discussed are snrs ( like w49b @xcite ) in star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) and starbursts galaxies ( sbgs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "at the same time , this interaction will produce a certain amount of gamma - rays and contribute to the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) , and a common origin of the diffuse backgrounds has been suggested @xcite .",
    "other possible astrophysical sources which can contribute to the icecube neutrino flux include gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , low - luminosity grbs or trans - relativistic supernovae ( sne )  @xcite , active galactic nuclei @xcite , galaxy clusters and groups @xcite , newborn pulsars @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there are also arguments about a possible galactic contribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , the fermi - lat instrument has measured the egb in the energy range from 0.1 to 820 gev @xcite .",
    "new studies of the blazar flux distribution at gamma - ray energies above 50 gev have shown that most of the egb flux should be contributed by blazars , at a percentage level @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this means that the diffuse gamma - ray flux from other sources can not exceed the residual non - blazar component , which puts a strong constraint on the sbg scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that sbgs can not explain the icecube data below 100 tev especially if the above constraint on the non - blazar component is taken into account .",
    "more quantitatively , @xcite argued , from the known branching ratio between charged and neutral pion production , that the gamma - ray emission of sbgs explaining the icecube data would be well beyond @xmath8 , so these observational results would be in strong tension with the sbg scenario .",
    "interestingly , similar results are also found by the gamma - ray anisotropy data @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we argue that if we attribute , as is common , the production of crs in sbgs to snrs , then taking into account the time - behavior of the snr evolution , and taking into account also a contribution from very - high - redshift snrs in a pop - iii component , it is possible to reduce the portion of the egb which is in tension with fermi , so that sbgs could contribute a potentially interesting fraction of the icecube neutrino flux .",
    "we assume that the neutrinos are mainly produced at the end of the free expansion and during the sedov - taylor phase of the snr , in which the maximum cr energy and maximum neutrino energy naturally decreases with time due to a decreasing expansion velocity and magnetic field in the shock . for the accompanying @xmath9-rays , after the @xmath10 cascade process , this also translates into a different  elbow \" of the egb .",
    "the total cr energy injection rate during the evolution may be uncertain , and here we parametrize it as a simple universal power law in time during the sedov phase , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 ranging from zero to negative values .",
    "we then discuss the impact of @xmath12 on the final neutrino and gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we found that negative values of @xmath12 are more favorable from the point of view of attributing a significant fraction of the neutrino and gamma - ray background to snrs , including both normal hne and sne , as discussed below .",
    "conversely , an appreciable contribution of sbg snrs to these backgrounds would have implications for the acceptable values of @xmath12 , and thus for the cr production efficiency as a function of the snr dynamics .",
    "one main difference between our paper and previous work is that we allow for a wider range of hn ejecta energies , and we allow for the different cr maximum energy and flux contribution at different stages of the snr expansion . the other",
    ", more significant major difference is that we allow for a pop - iii population of snrs , with a comparable cosmic ray acceleration efficiency and comparable or larger kinetic energy as those attributed to @xmath13 snrs and hnrs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model and method of calculation in section 2 .",
    "then section 3 presents our results showing the combined fits of our model compared with the icecube and fermi egb data .",
    "the implications of the results are presented in section 4 .",
    "after the early free expansion , the evolution of a snr enters the sedov - taylor self - similar expansion phase @xcite . the ejected remnant shell collides with and sweeps up the ambient medium , forming a shock which can accelerate crs that subsequently , via @xmath6 collisions , produce high energy neutrinos and @xmath9-rays .",
    "we take the beginning of the sedov - taylor phase as the onset time for cr acceleration and secondary neutrino and @xmath9-ray production .",
    "this occurs at a time t_0=&= & + & & 1.410 ^ 3_sn,51 ^ -1/2n_0,0 ^ -1/3m_ej,1 ^ 5/6yr [ eq : t0 ] after the initial explosion .",
    "the ending time of the sedov - taylor phase @xmath14 occurs when the adiabatic expansion approximation is no longer true , and this is determined by equating the cooling time of the post - shock region with the snr dynamic time .",
    "the gas cooling function has been evaluated in detail by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been adopted in our calculation to solve for @xmath14 as a function of different sets of parameters .",
    "we take the usual time dependence of the radius and the shock velocity in the sedov - taylor phase @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , and the commonly used estimate for the post - shock magnetic field @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ratio of the post - shock magnetic to thermal energy . in this work",
    ", we will assume the cr component to be pure protons .",
    "then , for diffusive shock acceleration , the maximum proton energy is estimated by equating the local acceleration time to the dynamical time ( the cooling timescale for @xmath6 collisions and synchrotron losses being much longer than the dynamical timescale , e.g. @xcite ) , which gives @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the sedov - taylor phase the maximum cr energy also depends on time , _",

    "obviously , we would expect to increase the fraction of hne contribution because they can achieve higher cr energies .",

    "one way to address this might be to increase the rate of hne ( or to choose a very large sbg fraction @xmath99 ) , thus increasing the energy input of hne so as to reach the icecube data , but this inevitably gives rise to an increased gamma - ray flux which would overshoot the fermi data .",
    "however , for the physically more reasonable negative @xmath12 values , the neutrino spectrum is  flatter \" ( since at later times in the hn evolution both the maximum energy and the flux decrease ) and more energy is evident in the flux at the high energy end , so we do not need such a high fraction of hne as before .",
    "we can see that the last icecube data point is reachable for @xmath100 and @xmath101 using a quite conservative hn fraction @xmath83",
    ". clearly , negative values of @xmath12 are more favorable from an observational point of view .    generally , the parameter space gets larger for smaller @xmath12 .",
    "the major parameters that we can adjust in our fits include the sbg upstream magnetic field ; the kinetic energies @xmath102 ; the pre - shock medium number density @xmath103 ; the hne fraction @xmath104 ; and the cr acceleration efficiency @xmath105 .",

    "a stronger field helps to explain the observations .",
    "the key issue here is that we wish to achieve higher maximum proton energies in order to account for pev neutrino flux .",
    "alternatively , given the contribution of other sources such as blazars to the fermi gamma - ray background @xcite , we can provide limits on the snr contributions to the neutrino flux .",
    "if we normalize the gamma - ray flux to the best - fit 14% of the total egb , we find that for our nominal parameters the corresponding diffuse neutrino flux is about 50% of the observed value , provided that we choose not to satisfy the @xmath110 30 tev neutrino data point , which however has small error bars .",
    "if this data point has a different physical origin than the higher energy data points , sbgs may still contribute a potentially interesting fraction of the @xmath111 tev icecube neutrino flux .",
    "one may wonder whether very - high - energy gamma - rays may be attenuated inside sfgs and sbgs .",
    "this could happen above @xmath112  tev energies @xcite .",
    "however , this would not change the results essentially .",
    "the synchrotron losses of the cascade electron - positron pairs leads to a reduction in the diffuse gamma - ray flux",
    ". however , gamma - rays in the 0.1 - 10 tev range remain unattenuated in the sources and will be injected into intergalactic cascades .",
    "also , electron - positron pairs including the contribution from muon decays as well as primary electrons produce some gamma - rays , which can make the constraints tighter @xcite .",
    "an interesting but more uncertain contribution to the diffuse neutrino and gamma - ray background can be expected from the pop - iii star formation occurring at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these epochs ,",
    "besides the increased redshift of the received photons , also ( other things being equal ) the @xmath114 increase of the proper densities affects the @xmath10 interaction and the gamma - ray attenuation .",
    "pop - iii stars are extremely metal - poor and can be very massive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they may end their life as hn explosions , @xmath115 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such pop - iii sne , including jet - driven sne and grbs , are also expected to accelerate crs and produce neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties for this pop - iii epoch are significant , but we can use assume reasonable hn parameters used in the literature for illustrative purposes .",
    "for instance , the pop - iii star formation rate is under debate @xcite and can be @xmath116 times smaller @xcite .",
    "here , we use the hn explosion parameters of @xcite and the ebl model and the upper pop - iii model given in @xcite , with a typical hn kinetic energy of @xmath117 erg and an external gas density @xmath118 @xmath119 , the latter value being compatible with gas densities inferred from the @xmath120 grb afterglow analysis of @xcite .",
    "neglecting at first entirely the contribution of sne and hne at @xmath78 , we plot in figure  [ fig5 ] the contribution of only these pop - iii hne to the neutrino and gamma - ray flux received form the redshift range @xmath121 , using the @xmath37 case as an example .    from this figure [ fig5 ]",
    "it is seen that such pop - iii hne would likely make only a minor contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux . however , if the explosion energy is larger , @xmath122  erg , these pop - iii hne by themselves may be able to fit the neutrino data well , without violating the fermi - lat 14% residual background .",
    "actually , there is still a larger parameter space for this fitting , as evidenced by the upper bound shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , making pop - iii stars more interesting sources for the present purposes .",
    "alternatively , our results suggest that their explosion energy is limited to @xmath123  erg .",
    "based on this pop - iii model , we also explore the influence that the initial cr spectral index @xmath124 has on the results .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the case @xmath125 .",
    "solid lines are for @xmath81 and dashed lines are for an enhancement by a factor of 20 , while other parameters remain unchanged from figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we see that at high energies the upper bound is lower than that of the @xmath40 case .",
    "this means that for @xmath125 , under the same constraint given by fermi - lat , less neutrino flux can be attributed to the pop - iii stars . from this point of view , the smaller @xmath124 are more favorable",
    ". we can give a rough constraint of @xmath126 .",
    "of course there is no reason to assume that only pop - iii hnrs contribute neutrinos in the icecube energy range , so a more realistic scenario would involve at least two components contributing to the neutrino flux , one being the standard sne and hne in the usual redshift range @xmath127 , and the other being the pop - iii hne in the @xmath121 range .",
    "the occurrence rates in the lower redshift range are observationally better constrained than for the pop - iii component , but the ratio between the two has large uncertainties . since @xmath128 , the ratio between the pop - iii and pop - i / ii cr contribution can be written as @xmath129 here , as seen also from fig .  8 , the first term is @xmath130 , where the typical redshifts of pop i / ii and pop iii remnants are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "the second term gives @xmath133 and the last term is @xmath134 , leading to the ratio is @xmath135 .",
    "the star formation rate will be lower for pop - iii than it is at low redshifts .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath136 could be substantially larger due to a plausibly larger kinetic energy .",
    "thus , introducing this pop - iii contribution potentially allows one to produce a fraction approaching unity of the low and high redshift icecube neutrino flux , without violating the fermi residual gamma - ray background .",
    "an example with these two components is shown in figure  [ fig7 ] , where the pop - iii / pop - i / ii efficiency is set to the same @xmath81 .",
    "we can see that pop - iii hne can contribute an interesting fraction to the diffuse neutrino flux , providing a good argument in favor of sbg scenario .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the cr input power @xmath137 versus redshift for this fit , the pop - iii being subdominant ( red solid line ) .",
    "however , with a higher density @xmath138 , an @xmath139 ( at the low energy end ) is obtained for pop - iii , while @xmath140 for sbgs and @xmath141 for sfgs , which compensates for the lower star formation rates of pop - iii stars .",
    "( note that the assumed energy injection might be optimistic because of the uncertainty in @xmath69 and @xmath99 . )",
    "in this work we have considered the possible contribution of standard core collapse supernovae and hypernovae to the observed icecube diffuse neutrino background , including two aspects which , to our knowledge , have not been previously considered in the literature . one of these aspects is the time history of the snr evolution , which affects the effective total cosmic ray spectral output .",
    "considering the contribution of snrs and hnrs in the redshift range @xmath78 only , and considering a cr spectral injection power law slope @xmath40 and a cr injection efficiency which during the sedov - taylor phase tapers off as a time power law @xmath142 with @xmath143 , we performed detailed calculations of the resulting diffuse neutrino flux and the diffuse gamma - ray flux contributed by snrs of both the above types .",
    "it remains difficult to account for the neutrino data point at 30 tev as well as for the rest of the higher energy points with any single power law injection spectrum , as pointed out by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , if we do not include the 30 tev data point , e.g. by implicitly assuming that it is an extra component , perhaps due to hidden sources @xcite , we find that the neutrino flux contributed by sne and hne in sfgs at @xmath78 can explain about 50% of the remaining icecube observations , without violating the fraction of 14% of the diffuse gamma - ray flux which , according to the fermi - lat collaboration , can not be attributed to unresolved agns of known types @xcite .    in view of the observations showing that core - collapse grbs are associated with sn / hn type ib / c ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , it is pertinent to inquire what may be the potential contribution of such grbs to the diffuse neutrino and gamma - ray backgrounds discussed here . although so far there only about seven such associations verified through their spectrum , and a few tens verified through light curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a small fraction of all grbs ( @xmath144 ) , the association is believed to apply to all long grbs .",
    "note that the sne associated with grbs are mostly hypernovae , and all are of type ib / c , while here in our work the sne and hne considered are of all the core collapse types ii+ib / c . at low redshifts ,",
    "hne are a fraction @xmath145 of all core collapse sne , and only a fraction of order @xmath145 appears associated with grbs @xcite .",
    "since the average grb jet beaming correction is roughly 1/100 @xcite , the fraction of detected grbs which could be positionally associated with the neutrinos or gamma - rays discussed here is @xmath146 , which is negligible in our scenario .",
    "since at best only a fraction of the icecube neutrinos can be explained by sne and hne in the redshift range @xmath78 , the other new aspect considered here is the possible contribution of pop - iii hne at @xmath147 .",
    "@xcite discussed a possible contribution of very - high - redshift injections .",
    "@xcite recently argued that the icecube generic neutrino sources may reside at high redshifts , but their focus is not on pop - iii remnants . in our case",
    "we specifically considered pop - iii hnrs as main sources for both the low and high redshift neutrinos and gamma - rays , and we have used a specific model of the ebl evolution in the pop - iii redshift range @xcite .",
    "the pop - iii snrs are expected to be more energetic than their lower redshift counterparts , and could contribute significantly to the total cr output .",
    "the neutrinos will reach the observer unimpeded , but the gamma - rays produced at high redshifts need to travel longer and have a greater chance to be attenuated by interacting with the ebl .",
    "we find that , aside from the 30 tev data point , a neutrino flux compatible with icecube could be obtained by considering a substantial contribution from a pop - iii component , which does not violate the residual diffuse gamma - ray background constraint .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] is an example of such a fit , where the fiducial parameters @xmath148 erg and @xmath81 are used for pop - iii hnrs , which here contribute @xmath149 of the total neutrino flux .",
    "a larger neutrino contribution which still respects the fermi bounds , as shown in fig.5 , would require @xmath150  erg for the pop - iii rate model of @xcite , or larger for more pessimistic rate models such those of @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that it will be difficult for pop - iii hnrs to dominantly contribute to the observed high - energy backgrounds unless the explosion energy is @xmath151  erg . on the other hand",
    ", the explosion energy for supermassive stars at very - high - redshifts could be larger than @xmath152  erg @xcite .",
    "note that the relative ratio of the neutrino fluxes contributed by the high and low redshift components are largely uncertain . if the fraction of pop - iii hnrs were even higher than assumed here , there would be even less arriving high - energy gamma - rays , further weakening the tension with fermi - lat .",

    "<S> however , the neutrino data around 30 tev remain unexplained , which might suggest a different population of gamma - ray dark cr sources . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider possible contributions of pop - iii hnrs up to @xmath1 , and show that they are not constrained by the gamma - ray data , and thus could contribute to the diffuse high - energy backgrounds if their explosion energy reaches @xmath2  erg . </S>",
