    "in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , a system whose classical evolution is incomplete due to singularities in the potential may yield a quantum theory with unitary time evolution provided the singularities are sufficiently weak  @xcite .",
    "a  celebrated example is the attractive coulomb potential on  @xmath0 , proportional to  @xmath1 , whose quantum theory is unitary if a boundary condition at the origin is specified for the spherically symmetric sector  @xcite .",
    "another example is the attractive scale invariant potential on  @xmath2 , proportional to  @xmath3 , where the quantum theory is unitary if a boundary condition is specified at the origin  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address systems with a singular potential within a quantisation framework that introduces a discrete lattice on the classical configuration space .",
    "we shall examine the spectrum in the limit in which one or more lattice points approach the singularity .    while this question may be of pragmatic interest when the discrete lattice is adopted as a practical tool for approximating a standard schrdinger quantisation , our main motivation comes from the context in which the discreteness is fundamental , and specifically from the polymer quantisation framework @xcite that has been employed in loop quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "if a lattice point is taken to coincide with the classical singularity , the discrete quantum theory may be defined by explicitly regularising the potential  @xcite , or by restriction to the odd parity sector  @xcite , or by introducing a singularity boundary condition @xcite that mimics the robin family of boundary conditions in schrdinger quantisation on the half - line  @xcite : for the attractive coulomb potential and the attractive scale invariant potential , all these regularisations yield spectra that approximate the continuum quantum theory in the relevant limit  @xcite .",
    "were this approximation to the continuum theory however found not to exist when there are lattice points arbitrarily close to the singularity but not at the singularity itself , one would be forced to conclude that the regularisation mechanisms of @xcite rely on a fine - tuning .",
    "such fine - tuning would be undesirable in an implementation of fundamental discreteness in quantum theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to alleviate these fine - tuning concerns : we provide evidence that the singularity avoidance mechanisms based on a lattice point at the classical singularity @xcite _ are _ in quantitative agreement with the spectrum that is obtained in the limit of lattice points approaching the singularity .",
    "our results can be understood as indirect support for the thiemann singularity avoidance prescription in loop quantum gravity @xcite and quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "concretely , we consider the attractive coulomb potential and the attractive scale invariant potential on the discretised real line , first on an equispaced lattice whose shift with respect to the origin approaches zero , and then on a lattice that is equispaced except for two lattice points that approach the origin symmetrically from both sides .",
    "we evaluate numerically the eigenenergies of the ground state and a selection of low - lying excited states .",
    "an analytic variational argument shows that the ground state energy must decrease to negative infinity , and for the non - equispaced lattice the same holds also for the eigenenergy of the first excited state in the scale invariant potential .",
    "however , the first key outcome is that all the higher eigenvalues , within the range that our numerics is able to probe , tend to finite limits , and in this limit the eigenvalues form degenerate pairs .",
    "the second key outcome is that all but the lowest few of these pairs approach the eigenvalues of a discrete theory that has a lattice point at the origin but whose singularity is regularised by restriction to the odd parity sector  @xcite .",
    "finally , the approach to degeneracy can be reproduced from the discretised half - line quantum theory of @xcite by tuning the boundary condition parameter , with a linear relation between the lattice shift and the boundary condition parameter .    within our potentials and lattices",
    ", there is hence quantitative agreement between the limit in which one or two lattice points approach the singularity and the regularised quantum theories in which a lattice point resides at the singularity .",
    "a  qualitative discrepancy occurs only with the one or two lowest - lying eigenenergies that descend to negative infinity in the singular limit .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : polqm ] by recalling relevant features of quantisation on the discretised real line , for both of our lattices .",
    "the spectra for the coulomb potential and the scale invariant potential are presented respectively in sections [ sec : coulomb ] and  [ sec : scaleinv ] , and these spectra are compared with the discrete half - line theory in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",

    "we note in passing that the singularity in both the attractive coulomb potential and the attractive scale invariant potential is so strong that in the continuum quantum theory the positive half - line and the negative half - line are decoupled from each other  @xcite . in a lattice quantum theory that incorporates points from both halves of the real axis",
    ", this suggests that a comparison to the continuum theory should only use parity - invariant observables . if this suggestion is adopted , the even and odd sectors on a parity - invariant lattice become superselected , in the sense that all observables map even states to even states and odd states to odd states  @xcite .",

    "we consider first the equispaced lattice .",
    "we look for the negative energy eigenvalues by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath71 numerically .",

    "these results bear witness to unanimity amongst the mechanisms by which a classically singular continuum theory becomes nonsingular on quantisation , whether the quantisation is built on a continuous configuration space or on a discrete configuration space . if the discreteness is thought of as a pragmatic tool , as an approximation to a ` true ' quantisation with a continuous configuration space , the results are evidence that the various discrete treatments of the classical singularity yield compatible results and efficient approximations .",
    "if the discreteness is thought of as fundamental , the results are evidence that the core properties of the discrete theory do not rely on fine - tuning in the way in which the discreteness implements singularity avoidance . from this viewpoint , our results provide indirect support for the thiemann singularity avoidance prescription in loop quantum gravity @xcite and quantum field theory  @xcite .    for the coulomb potential , the cases of one or two lattice points approaching the singularity were qualitatively very similar , even in the lowest eigenvalues . for the scale invariant potential , by contrast , approaching the singularity with two lattice points affected the lowest eigenvalues significantly more strongly than with just one lattice point .",
    "this could perhaps have been expected on the grounds that the singularity in the scale invariant potential is stronger than in the coulomb potential",
    ". there would be scope for a systematic study of this phenomenon within a wider range of singular potentials , power - law and beyond , and within a wider variety of lattices .",
    "finally , in this paper we have considered only the bound state part of the spectrum .",
    "it would be equally interesting to study the behaviour of travelling wave packets @xcite in the limit where one or more lattice points approach the singularity : does the unbounded descent of the lowest one or two eigenvalues leave a footprint in the reflection and transmission of waves ?",
    "if yes , can the footprint be reproduced from a manifestly nonsingular theory , or could it possibly contain evidence of pathology , detectable by low energy observations ?",
