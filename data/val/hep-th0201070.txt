    "noncommutative quantum field theories have been studied very intensely over the last few years especially because of their relation to m - theory compactifications  @xcite and string theory in nontrivial backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "they are interesting because they preserve some of the nonlocal properties inherent in string theory .",
    "for example , t - duality is a manifest symmetry  @xcite .",
    "( for recent reviews of noncommutative gauge theory see  @xcite . )",
    "recently , noncommutative chern - simons was shown to give an alternative description of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .    at low enough energies",
    "the single - particle sector becomes relevant and thus it is enough to consider noncommutative quantum mechanics .",
    "( for early studies of noncommutativity in quantum mechanics see @xcite . ) in particular , one can consider the quantum mechanics of a charged particle moving on a two dimensional noncommutative surface in the presence of a constant magnetic field . the problem on the plane and the sphere has been considered in  @xcite , on the noncommutative torus in  @xcite and on noncommutative @xmath0 in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we generalize this to higher genus noncommutative riemann surfaces . in section  [ gaugetheory ]",
    "we review noncommutative @xmath6 gauge theory on @xmath0 .",
    "we study the quantum mechanics of a charged particle on noncommutative euclidean @xmath0 in a constant magnetic field in section  [ qmechanics ] .",
    "this problem has also been considered in  @xcite ; however , because only representations of the lie algebra @xmath7 which integrate to representations of the group @xmath8 were used , a quantization of the magnetic field resulted .",
    "such a quantization is certainly not observed in the commutative limit , since the topology of @xmath0 is trivial .",
    "we show that more general representations are allowed such that the magnetic field is not quantized .",
    "we also discuss the energy spectrum .",
    "unlike the usual landau levels on the plane , for commutative @xmath0 the hamiltonian has both a discrete spectrum and a continuum .",
    "semi - classically this can be understood as follows : on a plane , for any finite energy the classical orbits are closed and single valuedness of the wave function phase around the orbit leads to a quantization of the energy . on @xmath0 , if the energy is above a threshold , we have open trajectories and no quantization of the energy . the spectrum for noncommutative",
    "@xmath0 is similar , except that for a magnetic field above a critical value @xmath9 all motion is bounded and there is only a discrete spectrum .    in section  [ ncrs ]",
    "we construct quantum mechanics on a noncommutative riemann surface by modding @xmath0 by a discrete subgroup of @xmath10 which defines the cycles of a genus-@xmath1 surface .",
    "gauging of this discrete subgroup is just the requirement that the hilbert space is projected to states that transform trivially under the action of the subgroup , which corresponds to invariance of ( scalar ) wavefunctions around the cycles , up to gauge transformations and vacuum angles .",
    "we show that this gauging requires a certain quantization condition for the magnetic field and demonstrate that in the commutative limit this condition reduces to the standard dirac quantization of the flux .",
    "the landau level spectrum for a noncommutative riemann surface is the same as that of @xmath0 but with finite degeneracy .",
    "one also expects a discrete spectrum above the threshold , but little is known about this even in the commutative case .",
    "a partial list of studies of the same problem on a commutative riemann surface is  @xcite .",
    "the concept of a noncommutative riemann surface was also discussed in  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the last section we briefly discuss some open issues for future investigation .",
    "in this section we discuss @xmath6 gauge theory on the noncommutative @xmath0 .",
    "we follow closely the treatment of the noncommutative sphere in  @xcite .",
    "field theory on the noncommutative sphere was introduced in  @xcite and studied rather extensively in  @xcite .",
    "first consider the lie algebra @xmath11=i~\\frac{\\theta}{r } ~\\epsilon_{ij}^{~~k } x_k~,\\label{lie}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real parameters which we take to be positive , @xmath14 and indexes are raised and lowered with the metric @xmath15 .",
    "the rescaled generators @xmath16 satisfy the @xmath7 relations @xmath17=i~\\epsilon_{ij}^{~~k } r_k~ , \\label{sl2r}\\ ] ] with the quadratic casimir @xmath18    let us briefly describe the unitary representations of @xmath7 .",
    "these representations are infinite dimensional since the metric is of indefinite signature .",
    "usually , in the mathematical literature  @xcite one finds the description of the representations of the lie algebra which can be integrated to true representations of the groups @xmath8 or @xmath10 . while somewhat less familiar than the unitary representations of @xmath19 , they can nevertheless be obtained exactly in the same way .",
    "one starts with an arbitrary @xmath20 eigenstate @xmath21 of unit norm and obtain other states in the representation by applying @xmath22 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath23 are hermitian , one can calculate the norm of these states and require it to be positive .",
    "after this analysis  @xcite , one obtains representations which are of the following types :    * _ principal discrete series : _",
    "these representations act on the hilbert space @xmath24 the state @xmath25 has @xmath26 , and the state @xmath27 has the highest weight in @xmath28 while @xmath29 has the lowest weight in @xmath30 .",
    "the casimir equals @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary positive _ real _ number . * _ principal continuous series : _",
    "these representations act on the hilbert space @xmath33 labeled by two continuous parameters @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "the casimir is given by @xmath31 for @xmath35 where @xmath36 is real and positive .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is real and can be chosen to satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "the states have @xmath26 . * _ complementary continuous series : _",
    "these representations act on the hilbert space @xmath38 the parameter @xmath34 is real and can be chosen to satisfy @xmath39 while @xmath32 is real in the interval @xmath40 and must satisfy @xmath41 . * _ identity representation : _  this is the trivial one dimensional representation .",
    "the representations in the discrete series form a discrete set only if we require them to integrate to representations of either the group @xmath8 or @xmath10 .",
    "then , @xmath32 must be an integer or half integer for @xmath8 , while for @xmath10 it must be an integer .",
    "in general , a unitary representation of a semi - simple lie algebra is also a unitary representation of the universal covering group @xmath42 of all the groups @xmath43 with the given algebra .",
    "since such a group @xmath43 has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath42 , to obtain representations of @xmath43 we must restrict to @xmath45-invariant representations of @xmath42 .",
    "equivalently , a necessary and sufficient condition for a representation of a semi - simple lie algebra to integrate to a representation of the lie group @xmath43 , is to be a good representation of a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath43 . regarded as a riemannian manifold ( with the metric given by the killing metric ) ,",
    "the universal covering group of @xmath8 or @xmath10 is in fact the familiar @xmath46 of unit radius and nonperiodic time and its covering group see  @xcite . ] .",
    "it has the topology @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes a disk .",
    "we can obtain @xmath8 by identifying time with period @xmath49 and @xmath10 by identifying time with period @xmath50 .",
    "both groups have the topology @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to the quantization of @xmath32 described above .",
    "noncommutative @xmath0 of radius @xmath13 is defined as the matrix algebra generated by @xmath52 in the @xmath53 irreducible unitary representation where the casimir satisfies @xmath54 and @xmath55 is positive definite .",
    "we must take @xmath56 so that @xmath57 be negative",
    ". then the parameter @xmath12 is given by @xmath58 for states with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ( [ lie ] ) reduces to the planar noncommutativity relation @xmath61 = -i \\theta$ ] and thus @xmath12 is identified as the noncommutativity parameter .",
    "note that for fixed @xmath13 , since @xmath32 can vary continuously , there is no quantization of @xmath12 .    in the operator approach , scalar fields on noncommutative @xmath0 space",
    "are defined as arbitrary operators on the hilbert space and thus can be identified with arbitrary elements of the algebra @xmath62 .",
    "we can implement the infinitesimal action of @xmath7 on the generators of the noncommutative @xmath0 as @xmath63= i~\\epsilon_{ij}^{~~k } x_k$ ] .",
    "since this action is a derivation , we can define it also on an arbitrary element @xmath62 of the algebra as @xmath64~.\\nonumber\\ ] ] we can then define the derivative operators @xmath65 on @xmath62 , which satisfy @xmath66-\\frac{1}{r}\\epsilon^{~~k}_{ij } \\nabla_k=0~.\\nonumber\\ ] ]    we now formulate gauge theory on the noncommutative @xmath0 .",
    "the covariant derivative operators can be defined as a perturbation of the derivative operators @xmath67 under gauge transformations , which are just time - dependent infinite dimensional unitary matrices @xmath68 , the covariant derivative operators transform as @xmath69 it is convenient to also introduce covariant coordinates  @xcite @xmath70 parametrizing a noncommutative two - dimensional membrane .",
    "the requirement that there be only two independent components of the gauge field on @xmath0 is equivalent to the requirement that there be no transversal excitations of the membrane .",
    "so the @xmath71 satisfy the hyperboloid condition @xmath72 , or , equivalently , @xmath73 this can be rewritten as @xmath74 in the commutative limit @xmath75 ,  ( [ trans ] ) is just the condition that @xmath76 is tangent to the hyperboloid .",
    "we can define a gauge covariant field strength as @xmath77-\\frac{1}{r } ~\\epsilon_{ij}^{~~k}d_k~.\\nonumber\\ ] ] notice that @xmath78 for vanishing @xmath76 or any other gauge equivalent configuration . for a commutative time we also introduce @xmath79 and define @xmath80~.\\nonumber\\ ] ]",
    "since the integral on @xmath0 is just @xmath81 the maxwell action takes the form @xmath82",
    "in this section we discuss the quantum mechanics of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field on a noncommutative @xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic field , defined as @xmath83 , takes the form @xmath84 to have a uniform magnetic field we will take @xmath85 proportional to the gauge - covariant coordinate @xmath71 @xmath86 and this together with equation  ( [ bfield ] ) implies @xmath87=\\frac{1-\\theta b}{r } \\ , \\epsilon_{ij}^{~~k } d_k~,\\nonumber\\ ] ] which , up to a rescaling of @xmath88 , are just the @xmath7 relations .",
    "thus we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 satisfy the algebra  ( [ sl2r ] ) . since @xmath88 still have to satisfy ( [ d2 ] )",
    ", we take the representation of @xmath90 to be irreducible and of the form @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "we will show shortly that the choice of @xmath93 or @xmath94 depends on the value of @xmath95 . by a gauge transformation we can bring the @xmath90 in the standard form where @xmath96 is diagonal .",
    "the relation  ( [ d2 ] ) implies that @xmath36 must satisfy @xmath97 since neither @xmath32 nor @xmath36 are quantized when considering unitary representations of the lie algebra , the relation  ( [ noq ] ) does not imply any quantization of @xmath95 as was assumed in  @xcite .",
    "this result is compatible with the commutative limit where @xmath95 is not quantized , since @xmath0 has a trivial topology .    for a charged field @xmath62 , with the gauge transformation @xmath98",
    ", we define the covariant derivative action as @xmath99 on the right hand side , @xmath88 represents an element of the algebra while on the left hand side it denotes an action on @xmath62 .",
    "we can also write this as @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath62 is a matrix multiplied on the left by @xmath102 representation matrices and on the right by @xmath103 representation matrices .",
    "it is more convenient to have both of these multiplications described as actions on the left .",
    "since the generators are hermitian , transposition is equivalent to complex conjugation and this takes @xmath103 into @xmath104 .",
    "concretely , to the matrix @xmath105 we associate the state @xmath106 where @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) denote operators acting on states of the @xmath102 ( @xmath28 ) representations . in this notation ,",
    "the action of the generators @xmath109 of the @xmath7 , representing the infinitesimal symmetry of @xmath0 , takes the form @xmath110 in particular , @xmath111 can be identified with angular momentum around the origin .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath62 can be obtained from an action of the schredinger type @xmath112 then the hamiltonian is given by @xmath113 , and with a little bit of algebra it can be rewritten as @xmath114 the spectrum and eigenstates of the hamiltonian are trivially related to those of @xmath115 , and thus they are given by pure representation theory .",
    "they can be obtained from the following tensor product decompositions @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "note that in  ( [ dpm ] ) , the rhs .",
    "contains representations from both the discrete and the continuous series , and that the discrete series start at @xmath119 .",
    "the dots in  ( [ dpm ] ) stand for complementary series representations . however , in the expansion of a normalizable state in terms of energy eigenstates the complementary series representations have zero measure  @xcite , thus they do not contribute to the spectrum .    to choose between @xmath93 and @xmath94 we require that the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] )",
    "be bounded from below . for @xmath120 , since @xmath121 is positive we choose @xmath122 . by  ( [ dpm ] )",
    "there is only a finite number of discrete series representations and because of the second term in  ( [ ham ] ) the hamiltonian is positive definite .",
    "the spectrum consists of a finite set of discrete landau level energies @xmath123 above which there is a continuous spectrum , starting at the threshold energy @xmath124    for @xmath125 , since @xmath121 is negative , we have a hamiltonian bounded from below if we choose @xmath126 . in this case",
    "there is only a discrete energy spectrum given by @xmath127 this phase is a purely noncommutative one .",
    "we can check that , in the limit @xmath128 with constant @xmath12 , the above spectrum reproduces the landau levels on the noncommutative plane found in @xcite . in that limit the continuous spectrum is pushed to infinity . for the discrete levels we have ,",
    "up to @xmath129 corrections , @xmath130 in agreement with the planar result .",
    "the density of states agrees as well .",
    "this gives an independent justification for the choice of @xmath94 for the representation of the covariant derivatives in the case @xmath125 , since the system maps to the correct over - critical planar phase . at the commutative @xmath0 limit , @xmath75 for constant @xmath13",
    ", we recover the standard results @xcite .",
    "= 4.0 in    the form of the spectrum we obtained is depicted in figure [ fig1 ] : for small positive values of the magnetic field ( @xmath131 ) the spectrum is entirely continuous , with a threshold as in ( [ thres ] ) . for positive @xmath95 corresponding to @xmath132 , a single landau level ` peels ' from the bottom of the continuum . for @xmath133 a second level peels , and so on .",
    "as @xmath134 , an infinity of landau levels has formed , while the continuum is pushed to infinity . above @xmath135",
    "no more landau levels are formed and there is no continuum .",
    "similarly , for negative values of @xmath95 , landau levels peel from the continuum at points at which @xmath136 equals negative half - integers . since @xmath92",
    ", there is a lowest such point , for @xmath137 - \\frac{1}{2}$ ] corresponding to some @xmath138 , at which the last landau level peels . for @xmath139 no more landau levels form .",
    "we see that , for negative @xmath95 , there is a maximum number of landau levels @xmath140 $ ] . for large @xmath13 or small @xmath12 , @xmath141 .",
    "the entirely discrete spectrum above @xmath9 and the existence of @xmath142 are purely noncommutative effects .",
    "in this section we will formulate quantum mechanics on a noncommutative riemann surface by gauging a discrete symmetry group of the action  ( [ sch ] ) . to set the stage , we first review how to obtain a commutative riemann surface endowed with a constant curvature metric by modding out the upper half - plane ( or the mass hyperboloid ) by the action of a fuchsian group  @xcite .    consider a riemann surface @xmath143 of genus @xmath1 on which we have chosen a canonical homology basis with generators @xmath144 , i.e. the intersection numbers are given by @xmath145 let us pick a representative in the homology class of each generator which also goes through a fixed point @xmath146 on @xmath143 .",
    "then , @xmath147 and @xmath148 can be interpreted as generators of the fundamental group @xmath149 based at @xmath146 of the surface @xmath143 . as such",
    ", they satisfy @xmath150 to understand the equation  ( [ cut ] ) , take the above homology generators passing through @xmath146 to be geodesics and then cut @xmath143 along them .",
    "the resulting surface , called the cut riemann surface @xmath151 , is a @xmath152-gon and the product on the lhs .",
    "of  ( [ cut ] ) is just the boundary cycle .",
    "this is obviously contractable to a point .",
    "the group of isometries of the mass hyperboloid @xmath153 is @xmath10 .",
    "group elements of @xmath10 acting without a fixed point are called hyperbolic ( they are called elliptic if they have a finite fixed point and parabolic if the fixed point is at infinity ) .",
    "consider a discrete subgroup @xmath45 of @xmath10 isomorphic to the fundamental group @xmath149 and containing only hyperbolic elements .",
    "then @xmath45 must be generated by @xmath154 and @xmath155 satisfying @xmath156 all the nondegenerate riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 can be obtained by modding out the mass hyperboloid by the action of such a group @xmath45 .",
    "one can chose a covering of the hyperboloid such that each fundamental region is isomorphic to the cut riemann surface @xmath151 .",
    "the action  ( [ sch ] ) is invariant under the infinitesimal @xmath7 transformations  ( [ inf ] ) .",
    "these transformations , actually , involve both space translations and gauge transformations .",
    "they commute with the hamiltonian and correspond to the magnetic translations of the particle .",
    "they are , thus , the appropriate transformations to be used in order to reduce the hilbert space to the one of the genus-@xmath1 riemann surface .",
    "as we will see , if @xmath32 and @xmath36 are chosen appropriately , one can integrate the infinitesimal action of these generators and represent the group @xmath45 on the set of states .",
    "we therefore define quantum mechanics on the noncommutative riemann surface as the system obtained by gauging the group @xmath45 , in analogy to the commutative case .",
    "since this group is discrete this just means that we must project onto the subspace of gauge invariant states .",
    "more generally , we can require invariance up to a phase ( vacuum angle ) @xmath157 in the above , the index @xmath34 runs over the @xmath147 and @xmath148 cycles , while @xmath68 and @xmath158 denote the @xmath159 and @xmath30 representations of @xmath160 . for @xmath161 the set of @xmath62 s satisfying  ( [ mod ] ) form the algebra of `` functions '' on the noncommutative riemann surface .",
    "for @xmath162 the set of @xmath62 s satisfying  ( [ mod ] ) define a projective module which is the noncommutative analogue of the set of sections of a vector bundle .    using  ( [ mod ] ) repeatedly we obtain the consistency condition @xmath163 as we will now show , equation  ( [ cocycle ] ) implies a quantization of @xmath164 .    for @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath36 integers , @xmath159 and @xmath30 are also representations of @xmath10 and the relation  ( [ fuchs ] ) implies @xmath165 thus the consistency condition  ( [ cocycle ] ) is satisfied trivially . however , for @xmath32 and @xmath36 _ real _ positive , since the representations @xmath68 and @xmath158 are only representations of the universal covering group @xmath166 we only have @xmath167 as we will explain shortly . in this case , the consistency condition  ( [ cocycle ] ) is satisfied if the two phases in  ( [ phase ] ) are equal .",
    "the origin of the above phases is as follows : since all the @xmath160 are hyperbolic , they can be written as exponentials of elements in the lie algebra . using the exponential map ,",
    "@xmath160 can also be understood as group elements in the universal covering group @xmath166 .",
    "the product on the lhs . of  ( [ fuchs ] ) with the multiplication performed in the universal covering group does not necessarily give the identity but some element of @xmath166 which projects to the identity of @xmath10 . by looking at the form of the @xmath20 ( or @xmath96 ) generators",
    "one can see that such an element is represented by a phase .",
    "let us associate to each @xmath160 a curve in @xmath10 denoted @xmath168 representing a portion of a one dimensional subgroup passing through @xmath160 such that @xmath169 is the identity and @xmath170 . then to the product @xmath171 we associate a curve of length @xmath152 by translating and joining the curves @xmath168 in the obvious way : for @xmath172 the curve is given by @xmath173 ; for @xmath174 the curve is given by @xmath175 ; and so on .",
    "due to the relation  ( [ fuchs ] ) this must be a closed curve in @xmath10 .",
    "however , the curve winds @xmath176 around the noncontractable @xmath177 cycle of @xmath10 and thus it is an open curve in @xmath166 .",
    "before we calculate the winding in our problem , let us describe one way of obtaining it for an arbitrary closed curve @xmath178 in @xmath10 .",
    "fix a reference point @xmath146 on the hyperboloid and a reference tangent vector at @xmath146 .",
    "the curve @xmath179 is a closed curve on the hyperboloid .",
    "the action of @xmath178 on the reference vector gives a periodic vector field around the curve @xmath179 .",
    "the winding is just the number of times the vector spins around itself as it goes once around the curve and is a topological invariant .    in our problem",
    "the curve @xmath179 is just the boundary of @xmath151 , and the reference vector is parallel transported around the boundary of @xmath151 . under parallel transport on a hyperboloid of radius @xmath13 around a closed loop enclosing an area @xmath180 , a vector is rotated by an angle @xmath181 . since the scalar curvature is given by @xmath182 , using the gauss - bonnet theorem one can find the area of the surface @xmath143 to be @xmath183 . thus under parallel transport around @xmath143 a vector rotates an angle @xmath184 .",
    "since we have @xmath185 , the phase is given by @xmath186 .",
    "the group @xmath45 defined by the relation  ( [ fuchs ] ) is only represented projectively @xmath187 projective representations of @xmath45 were also considered in  @xcite where they were obtained with the help of a gauge field on the poincare plane . here",
    "we see that projective representations naturally occur if @xmath32 is not an integer or half - integer .",
    "finally , the consistency condition  ( [ cocycle ] ) implies the quantization @xmath188 where @xmath189 is an arbitrary integer .    from experience with the noncommutative sphere and torus we know that a more relevant quantity is a rescaled magnetic field @xmath190 .",
    "this would be the strength of the seiberg - witten mapped commutative gauge field in the planar case . from equation  ( [ noq ] ) we obtain @xmath191 since @xmath32 is fixed for a given @xmath13 and @xmath12 by relation  ( [ theta ] ) , and @xmath164 is quantized as in  ( [ sj ] ) we see that @xmath192 can only take discrete values .",
    "note however that , unlike the commutative case , the values of @xmath192 are not equally spaced .    as a check ,",
    "consider the commutative limit , obtained by taking @xmath32 and @xmath36 to infinity while keeping @xmath13 and @xmath95 finite ( we must choose @xmath193 ) . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath194 , thus we must keep @xmath136 finite . using this ,",
    "we obtain the following integral quantization for the flux @xmath195 this is the expected dirac quantization ( or integrality of the first chern number ) .",
    "we have formulated the problem of a charged particle on a noncommutative genus-@xmath1 riemann surface and found the condition required for the existence of scalar wavefunctions . the spectrum of the particle , on the other hand , has not been fully identified . to achieve this , we would need to identify the physical states which satisfy the genus-@xmath1 condition ( [ mod ] ) .",
    "this is , in principle , a purely group - theoretic problem .",
    "we expect the degeneracy of each discrete landau level to become finite , and also the continuous spectrum to be fragmented into discrete nondegenerate states . besides the landau levels , there should be additional states below the threshold corresponding to linear combinations of complementary series states .",
    "it is interesting to understand how the continuous spectrum for the noncommutative @xmath0 emerges from the discrete spectrum of the noncommutative riemann surface as we take the genus @xmath1 and thus the area to infinity .",
    "in particular note that only complementary series states contribute to the continuum .",
    "as we take the area to infinity the density of states increases , but to obtain a continuum the density must scale as the square root of the area .",
    "presumably , this is what happens for the principal but not for the complementary continuous representation states .",
    "carrying out this calculation and identifying the full spectrum and degeneracies is a very interesting open issue .",
    "the dirac - like quantization condition for the strength of the magnetic field was derived by demanding invariance of the wavefunction under magnetic translations around the cycles of the noncommutative riemann surface .",
    "it should be stressed that , as in the noncommutative torus case and unlike the sphere , this is not a requirement for consistency of the problem .",
    "in fact , we could have promoted the wavefunction @xmath62 into a multicomponent vector by tensoring it with an @xmath196-dimensional vector space @xmath197 and demand invariance under combined magnetic translations and @xmath198 transformations , which would have resulted in an @xmath196-fold decrease in the unit of quantization in ( [ sj ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to ` overlapping ' @xmath196 copies of the fundamental domain of the riemann surface .    in the toroidal case  @xcite",
    ", the problem can be analyzed entirely in the canonical framework by defining physical coordinate and momentum variables which are well - defined on the torus .",
    "the representation theory of the algebra of these observables reproduces the above extended wavefunctions . in the genus-@xmath1 case",
    "there is no immediately obvious complete set of such observables .",
    "formulating and analyzing the noncommutative riemann problem in terms of such canonical observables is an interesting open problem .    finally , we should remark that , although here we have only considered @xmath199 , it is obvious that the construction can be generalized to @xmath200 where @xmath43 is a real semisimple lie group and @xmath201 is its maximal compact subgroup .",
    "application of this technique to physically relevant situations , such as the noncommutative gravity setting of @xcite , would be an interesting possibility .",
    "moreover , the methods developed in this paper could also be applied to the study of d - branes on @xmath46 , see @xcite and references therein .",
