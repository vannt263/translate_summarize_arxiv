    "tunneling properties of , e.g. , local bond excitations in molecules , of bound states in quantum lattices or of large spins in the presence of anisotropy fields share a lot of similarities of corresponding model approaches and technical treatments . despite the amount of published work",
    "this field lacks complete understanding .",
    "especially intriguing are the relation to so - called dynamical tunneling in phase space @xcite , the influence of heat bath coupling @xcite , the exact computation of tunneling probabilities @xcite , to name a few .",
    "to study different aspects of the problem it is helpful to formulate a model which shares most of the needed properties , and is numerically solvable ( because it is typically hard to obtain exact analytical results ) .    in the present paper",
    "we will study the tunneling of multi boson bound states in a model which we believe posesses all necessary qualitative ingredients needed for the understanding of a more general case .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath0 +   c\\left ( a_1^+a_2 + a_1 a_2^+\\right ) + \\delta \\left (   a_1^+a_3 + a_1 a_3^+ + a_2^+a_3 + a_2 a_3^+ \\right ) \\label{1 - 1}\\ ] ] here the operators @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are bosonic annihilation and creation operators with standard commutation relations @xmath3=\\delta_{lm}$ ] .",
    "note that ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) is invariant under permutation of site 1 with site 2 .",
    "equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) describes , e.g. , a three site ( or bond ) molecule , i.e. a trimer @xcite .",
    "it could also serve as a model for tunneling in a dimer @xcite ( just sites 1 and 2 ) under the simultaneous influence of a heat ( or energy ) bath on site 3 , coupled to the symmetric modes of the dimer .",
    "it may be used for a study of excitations in @xmath4 molecules , where the two @xmath5 stretching modes ( dimer ) are additionally coupled to the relative angle between the two bonds ( third site ) @xcite .",
    "finally ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) may be transformed into a model of a spin with local anisotropy and external field ( site 3 ) coupled to a bosonic field ( using schwinger bosons for sites 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the coupling is such that the total spin length will not be conserved , but may fluctuate .",
    "the dimer limit @xmath6 may be represented as a spin length conserving model with the hamiltonian @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "model ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) conserves in addition to the energy also the total particle number @xmath8 which is an eigenvalue of the total number operator @xmath9 @xmath10 note that due to this conservation the infinite dimensional hilbert space decomposes into an infinite set of finite dimensional orthogonal subspaces , each with a given total particle number .",
    "consequently numerical evaluations will always translate into diagonalizations of finite matrices , without worrying about truncation errors .",
    "the classical limit is obtained by replacing the operators @xmath11 with complex scalars @xmath12 ( hermitian conjugation is replaced by complex conjugation ) .    besides the above mentioned general interest in such kinds of model",
    "we want to give some additional reasons for studing of ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) . during the past decade we witnessed an explosion of interest to a new class of excitations in lattice models .",
    "these models are typically described by hamiltonian equations of motion of degrees of freedom associated with lattice points of spatial periodic lattices . in the presence of interaction between these degrees of freedom , when considering linear equations of motion ,",
    "the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice allows one to obtain delocalized plane wave solutions ( phonons , magnons and other _",
    "whateverons_. the spectra of these excitations have finite upper bounds due to the discreteness of the system .",
    "if instead considering rather arbitrary additional nonlinearities in the equations of motion , a new generic type of solutions appears : * discrete breathers * @xcite",
    ". these discrete breather solutions are time - periodic spatially localized excitations and appear in one - parameter families .",
    "the discrete breather concept can be easily extended to dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "much more complicated is the quantization of these excitations",
    ". the question arises which eigenstates of the quantum hamiltonian operator correspond to classical discrete breathers .",
    "intuition leads to the conclusion that one should search for multi _ whateveron _ bound states @xcite .",
    "one signature should be the appearance of extremely narrow quasiparticle bands in the high energy sector .",
    "quasiparticle stands for the need of just one wave vector which labels the states of the quantum breather band ( as opposed to many wave vectors which label many _ whateveron _ continua ) @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by the consideration of a ( semiclassical ) tunneling process of a discrete breather , which implicitely assumes that the quantum system may support coherent tunneling of localized excitations similar to a ( quasi)particle @xcite .",
    "extremely narrow could have different meanings . in the best case",
    "these bands should be much narrower than the mean level spacing in the given energy sector .",
    "this seems to be not so simple owing to the increase of the density of states when going up in energy .",
    "another aspect of narrow means weak interaction with nearby lying states .",
    "in contrast to the classical case , where implicit and explicit existence proofs of discrete breathers are known @xcite , and where reliable computational tools are available wich allows one to obtain numerical solutions on large lattices@xcite , the situation with the quantum case is different . except for some integrable one - dimensional models",
    "no analytical solutions are known .",
    "numerical evaluations will have to face the tremendous problem of diagonalizing large matrices even for moderate system sizes ( like 6 - 10 sites ) . in order to gain an insight into the problem it is useful to study small systems where",
    "the discrete breather concept can be partially used .",
    "although there is no localization length anymore , we may still find excitations which are mainly located on one site .",
    "the smallest possible system is thus a two site system , i.e. a dimer . for @xmath6 equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) describes an integrable dimer .",
    "the analysis of this model @xcite demonstrates that the existence of classical discrete breather solutions corresponds to the appearance of tunneling pairs of eigenstates .",
    "these pairs of eigenstates have energy splittings which are orders of magnitude smaller than the averaged level spacing .",
    "the relative splittings decrease with the increase of the eigenenergies , in full correspondence with the above described expectations .",
    "one nongeneric feature of the dimer model is its integrability . although it allowed to obtain analytical results",
    ", it could hide some features of the generic nonintegrable case .",
    "this conclusion led to the consideration of the trimer model .",
    "the third site was deliberately chosen to be different from the first two sites in order to preserve the symmetries of the model .",
    "some classical and quantum properties of ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) were described in detail in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the classical properties was devoted mainly to periodic orbit bifurcations which allow for an appearance of discrete breather solutions transforming into each other under the @xmath13 permutation in the trimer . in the quantum case",
    "we again observe pairs of symmetric and antisymmetric states with nearly coinciding energy levels .",
    "note that the energy splitting in such pairs is determined by the phase space tunneling amplitude between the above two classical solutions .",
    "the paper @xcite presents data on the behavior of such pairs as well as of individual levels with varying coupling parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we observe that pairs can be crossed by other pairs and/or by individual levels .",
    "the crossing for levels with the same symmetry is certainly avoided whereas levels with differing symmetries really cross each other . in many cases",
    "a pair is able to survive many crossings and restore itself up to large values of @xmath14 .",
    "however , sooner or later a fatal crossing comes which destroys the pair . in the classical system",
    "this loss is manifested by a strong overlap of the corresponding quantum wave function with chaotic layers in the phase space of the classical model .",
    "the level splittings were not analized in more detail .",
    "instead only their behaviour on scales comparable with the averaged level spacing were of interest . here",
    "we will present a careful analysis of the mighty changes of the tiny splittings as the coupling @xmath15 is changed . denote with @xmath16 the eigenvalues of the site number operators @xmath17 .",
    "we may consider the quantum states of the trimer at @xmath6 when @xmath18 is a good quantum number and then follow the evolution of these states with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "the state for @xmath6 can be traced back to @xmath19 and be thus characterized in addition by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in fig . 2(b ) in the previous paper @xcite we picked a tunneling pair which has energy @xmath22 for @xmath6 .",
    "the fixed model parameters were @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the pair states are characterized by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "note that this pair survives approximately 30 avoided crossings before it finally is destroyed at coupling strength @xmath29 .",
    "figure 1 presents the dependence of the tunneling splitting , @xmath30 , for this pair .",
    "one sees that the splitting rapidly increases gaining about eight orders of magnitude when @xmath15 changes from 0 to slightly above 0.5 .",
    "then this rapid but nevertheless smooth rise is interrupted by very sharp spikes when the splitting @xmath30 rises by several orders of magnitude with @xmath14 changing by mere percents and then abruptly changes in the opposite direction sometimes even overshooting its prespike value .",
    "such spikes , some larger , some smaller , repeat with increasing @xmath14 untill the splitting value approaches the mean level spacing ( of order one in the figure ) .",
    "only then one may say that the pair is destroyed since it can be hardly distinguished among the other trimer levels .",
    "another observation is presented in figs.2 ( a - e ) .",
    "we plot the intensity distribution of the logarithm of the squared symmetric wavefunction of our chosen pair for five different values of @xmath31 ( their locations are indicated by filled circles in fig.1 ) .",
    "we use the eigenstates of @xmath9 as basis states . they can be formally represented as @xmath32 where @xmath16 are the particle numbers on sites 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively . due to the commutation of @xmath9 with @xmath33 two site occupation numbers",
    "are enough if the total particle number is fixed .",
    "thus the final encoding of states ( for a given value of @xmath8 ) can be chosen as @xmath34 ( see also @xcite for details ) .",
    "the abscissa in figs.2 is @xmath20 and the ordinate is @xmath18 . thus the intensity plots provide us with information about the order of particle flow in the course the tunneling process .",
    "[ fig2a ]    [ fig2b ]    [ fig2c ]    [ fig2d ]    for @xmath6 ( fig.2a ) the only possibility for the 26 particles on site 1 is to directly tunnel to site 2 .",
    "site 3 is decoupled with its 14 particles not participating in the process .",
    "the squared wavefunction takes the form of a compact rim in the @xmath35 plane which is parallel to the @xmath20 axis .",
    "nonzero values of the wavefunction are observed only on the rim .",
    "this direct tunneling has been quantitatively described in @xcite .",
    "when switching on some nonzero coupling to the third site , the particle number on the dimer ( sites 1,2 ) is not conserved anymore .",
    "the third site serves as a particle reservoir which is able either to collect particles from or supply particles to the dimer .",
    "this coupling will allow for nonzero values of the wavefunction away from the rim .",
    "but most importantly , it will change the shape of the rim .",
    "we observe that the rim is bended down to smaller @xmath18 values with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "that implies that the order of tunneling ( when , e.g. , going from large to small @xmath20 values ) is as follows : first , some particles tunnel from site 1 to site 2 and simultaneously from site 3 to site 2 ( fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "afterwards particles flow from site 1 to both sites 2 and 3 ( fig.3(b ) ) . with increasing @xmath15 the structure of the wavefunction intensity becomes more and more complex , possibly revealing information about the classical phase space flow structure .",
    "thus we observe three intriguing features .",
    "first , the tunneling splitting increases by eight orders of magnitude when @xmath15 increases from zero to 0.5 .",
    "this seems to be unexpected , since at those values perturbation theory in @xmath15 should be applicable ( at least fig.2b in @xcite demonstrates that this should be true for the levels themselfes ) .",
    "the second observation is that the tunneling begins with a flow of particles from the bath ( site 3 ) directly to the empty site which is to be filled ( with simultaneous flow from the filled dimer site to the empty one ) . at the end of the tunneling process",
    "the initially filled dimer site is giving particles back to the bath site .",
    "again this is an unexpected result , since it implies that the particle number on the dimer is increasing during the tunneling , which seems to decrease the tunneling probability , according to the results for an isolated dimer .",
    "these first two results are closely connected , as we will show below .",
    "the third result concernes the resonant structure on top of the smooth variation in fig.1 .",
    "the resonant enhancements and suppressions of tunneling are related to avoided crossings .",
    "their presence implies that a fine tuning of the system parameters may strongly suppress or enhance tunneling which may be useful for spectroscopic devices . in the following",
    "we will explain all three observations .      to understand the order of tunneling we consider a generalized model hamiltonian for @xmath36 @xmath37 it reduces to ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) when choosing @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "switching on some interaction inside the dimer ( @xmath40 ) we will observe some tunneling probability .",
    "the smallness of this probability is due to the presence of an energy barrier hindering successive transferring of particles from one site of the dimer to the other .",
    "this energy barrier is given by @xmath41 where the total number of particles @xmath8 and the number of particles on the still isolated third site @xmath42 are fixed .",
    "note that the top of the barrier is reached when the particles are evenly spread inside the dimer ( it is straightforward to generalize to other cases ) .    at nonzero",
    "@xmath15 the value of @xmath18 may fluctuate .",
    "now we have to consider the energy in the two - dimensional plane @xmath35 . the energy landscape for an arbitrary distribution of particles with respect to the chosen initial distribution @xmath43 , @xmath44",
    ", @xmath45 reads @xmath46 for small values of @xmath15 the variation of @xmath18 will be small and we may expand around @xmath42 : @xmath47 .",
    "as noted above ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) has a maximum at @xmath48 for fixed @xmath42 .",
    "in general the derivative of this function along @xmath18 will , however , not vanish in this point .",
    "this implies that a variation of @xmath18 will change the barrier height .",
    "we have to determine the sign of the variation @xmath49 which lowers the barrier height .",
    "this sign will tell us whether the particle number on site 3 will decrease or increase during the tunneling .",
    "thus , we may predict or explain the change of the rim shape of the above described squared wavefunction .",
    "this in turn will allow us to conclude about the order of tunneling .",
    "define @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "straightforward arithmetics leads to the result : @xmath52\\;{\\rm or}\\ ; [ e_1<0\\;{\\rm and}\\;e_2 > 0 ] \\label{2 - 4 } \\\\ \\delta z < 0 & \\;\\;{\\rm otherwise}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our chosen hamiltonian ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) yields @xmath53 which is in full accord with the observed change of the rim shape in figs .",
    "the above considerations allow us to conclude that the tunneling enhancement due to the lowering of the barrier is not sensitive to the sign of @xmath54 .",
    "the only possibility to avoid tunneling enhancement is to choose @xmath55 .",
    "still one will be faced with consideration of higher order contributions of @xmath49 to the barrier change .",
    "now we present a semiclassical approach which is capable of accounting for the rapid increase of the energy splitting in the tunneling pair shown in fig.1 . for this sake",
    "we shall first discuss tunneling in the dimer .",
    "then we will show how the introduction of an interaction with the third site will modify the results .",
    "a semiclassical treatment of tunneling in the dimer was outlined in @xcite where canonical coordinates were introduced , using the classical variables @xmath56 , @xmath57 , & p=\\varphi_2 - \\varphi_1 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ &   \\nonumber \\\\ j = n_1 + n_2 , & \\ \\ \\",
    "\\chi= \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2\\right)\\;\\;.   \\label{3 - 1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these coordinates allow one to represent the dimer hamiltonian in the form @xmath58 here the phase @xmath59 plays the role of a momentum whereas @xmath60 is the coordinate along which the tunneling in the dimer takes place .",
    "the coordinate @xmath61 is an integral of motion , since the hamiltonian does not depend on its canonically conjugated momentum @xmath62 . in order to calculate the tunneling probability amplitude we first choose two symmetry breaking isolated periodic orbits with a certain energy @xmath63 and then look for a classical path @xmath64 in the complex time plane which connects these two orbits . on this way we have to cross classically forbidden areas where the momentum @xmath59 becomes imaginary .",
    "what we need to know is the dependence of the momentum @xmath59 on the coordinate @xmath60 which , in the classically forbidden area , is determined by the equation @xmath65 the boundaries @xmath66 of this area or the turning points are obtained from equation ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) at @xmath67 for a given energy @xmath63 .",
    "the tunneling probability amplitude can be estimated as @xmath68 where @xmath69 this integral can be readily evaluated for the energy @xmath70 ( for a given value of @xmath61 ) .",
    "then @xmath71 and @xmath72    this expression coincides , to within the preexponential factor , with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "however our aim here is to consider the tunneling amplitude of the trimer or , to be more specific , consider how the tunneling splitting for a certain pair of the trimer levels varies with the increase of the coupling parameter @xmath15 .",
    "a naive approach is based on equation ( [ 3 - 5 ] ) .",
    "an interaction with the third site of the trimer may lead to a change of the number @xmath61 of particles in the dimer ( first two sites ) .",
    "one can readily see that the action ( [ 3 - 5 ] ) becomes larger for larger @xmath61 values .",
    "since the total number of particles in the trimer is fixed , @xmath73 , an increase of @xmath61 occurs only at the expense of the third site which may provide the necessary particles .",
    "therefore the tunneling amplitude decreases if @xmath74 should decrease , and this is completely opposite to what we have observed numerically in the previous section .",
    "it means that a more detailed analysis is needed .",
    "first , we introduce canonical coordinates which are explicitly symmetric with respect to permutation of the first two sites of the trimer .",
    "@xmath75 the definitions of the two coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath59 , related to the dimer , remain as in equation ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "then the trimer hamiltonian ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) takes the form @xmath76 it becomes straightforward to obtain equations of motions for the four relevant coordinates , with @xmath8 being an integral of motion and @xmath77 redundant .",
    "we need here only two of this equations @xmath78 @xmath79 + \\nonumber \\\\ &   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\delta \\cos \\left(\\pi - \\frac{1}{2 } p \\right ) \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } \\sqrt{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}b - q\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3 } b + \\frac{1}{2 } q - q \\right ) } } } - \\sqrt{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{3 } b + \\frac{1}{2 } q - q \\right ) } { \\left(\\frac{1}{3}b - q\\right)}}}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{3 - 9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these equations will allow us to estimate the deviation of the tunneling trajectory in the ( @xmath80 ) plane .",
    "the latter can be directly mapped onto the ( @xmath18 , @xmath20 ) plane .",
    "again we may consider trajectories connecting isolated periodic orbits with @xmath81 . a reasonable approximation is to assume that @xmath82 along the path and then use equation ( [ 3 - 8 ] ) to estimate the deviation of the @xmath83 value from its initial @xmath84 values , @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the largest value of @xmath87 .",
    "it is estimated by substituting @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( the middle point of the tunneling path ) and @xmath90 into equation ( [ 3 - 8 ] ) . as for @xmath90",
    "it is found for the given dimer energy from equation ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) at @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath91 is the time of motion through the forbidden region ( traversal time ) .",
    "first , we again obtain that the tunneling trajectory really deviates towards lower values of @xmath83 , i.e. towards a decreasing number @xmath18 of bosons in the third site .",
    "it fits our numerical results . in order to calculate the corresponding action we slightly deform the trajectory .",
    "better to say we straighten the trajectory , which finally simply becomes a straight line with constant @xmath18 which is shifted towards lower @xmath18-values .",
    "we believe that this deformation would lead to a negligible change of the result since the deformation is carried out mainly in the borders of the forbidden area .",
    "the principal contribution to the integral comes , however , from the central part of this area .",
    "this procedure allows us to return to the calculation of the tunneling amplitude in the dimer by means of the integral ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) .",
    "however , the number of bosons , which has been @xmath61 in the isolated dimer , becomes now @xmath92 .",
    "as for the energy of the dimer it should remain without change ( @xmath93 ) , since we neglect small corrections ( order of @xmath94 ) due to the interaction with third site .",
    "the distance to the upper bound @xmath95 can be readily found , @xmath96 .",
    "there should be also a small shift of the turning points @xmath97 which is , however , of a minor importance .    as a result",
    "we can represent the action in an integral form @xmath98 this integral can be calculated analytically and in the trivial case of @xmath99 it reduces to equation ( [ 3 - 5 ] ) .",
    "however , the general analytic expression for ( ref3 - 11 ) is extremely cumbersome .",
    "that is why we have preferred to calculate this integral numerically .",
    "the thick dashed line in fig.1 is the graphical form of ( [ 3 - 11 ] ) .",
    "we observe very good agreement with the numerical data for tunneling in the trimer up to @xmath15 values where possibly our expansion becomes too crude and where the spiky structure sets in .",
    "yet our consideration is capable of quantitatively describing the raising of the tunneling splitting by eight orders of magnitude !",
    "let us give a semiquantitative understanding of the spiky behaviour of the energy splitting dependence on @xmath15 in fig.1 .",
    "comparing the position of the spikes with the level variation in fig.2b in @xcite we immediately realize that each resonance in fig.1 is related to an avoided crossing of our level pair with either a single third level or another tunneling pair .",
    "a simple analytical description of such crossing can be obtained following the same simple reasoning which has led to the understanding of an avoided crossing of just two levels ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us first assume that we have found all eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of the trimer for given values of the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we denote the energies and wave function of our tunneling pair as @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 . here",
    "indices @xmath106 and @xmath107 relate to the symmetric and antisymmetric states .",
    "we also assume that there is a level or another pair of levels which happen to be very close to our tunneling pair",
    ". then we may consider small variations @xmath108 of the coupling parameter @xmath14 near its @xmath101 value ( @xmath109 ) and calculate the variation of the level energies by means of the perturbation theory , neglecting contributions from all other more distant levels .",
    "the corresponding perturbation is explicitly symmetric with respect to the @xmath110 permutations .",
    "therefore it may mix only the states with the same symmetry , so that those levels will avoid crossings .",
    "as for states of different symmetries , their crossing is allowed .",
    "first we consider the case when the tunneling pair is approached by a single level which we choose to be symmetric with respect to the permutation of the dimer sites .",
    "the energy and the wave function of this level at @xmath111 are @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "such a crossing can be described by the @xmath114 matrix @xmath115 where all terms proportional to @xmath108 are the corresponding matrix elements of the perturbation .",
    "they vanish at @xmath116 which is close enough to the avoided crossing .    diagonalizing the matrix ( [ 3 - 13 ] ) we obtain three levels @xmath117^{2}}{4}}+ v_{s12}^{2}\\tilde{\\delta}^{2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "in the first case at @xmath118 the order of the levels in either increasing or decreasing order is @xmath119 , @xmath102 , @xmath120 . in this case",
    "we will first see a decrease of the splitting down to zero ( ! ) and a subsequent increase of the splitting up to some maximum with subsequent decrease down to its original value . in the second case @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 the above sequence is reversed - we first observe an increase up to a maximum , then a decrease down to zero and a final increase to the original splitting value .",
    "all the parameters may be chosen to be positive .",
    "the difference between the coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 is neglected since this difference reflects the slow change of the level splitting with varying @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "the perturbation theory allows us to deal only with small values of @xmath125 , hence parameters should satisfy the conditions that @xmath126 can be found as a function of @xmath108 .",
    "it can be defined as the smallest distance between the antisymmetric level and the two symmetric levels , @xmath127    [ fig4a ]    [ fig4b ]    [ fig4c ]    an example is shown in fig.4(a ) ( @xmath128,@xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , the asymmetric level lies below its symmetric counterpart in the tunneling pair . ) where @xmath134 is plotted as a function of @xmath108 .",

    "then choosing the difference with the lowest absolute value we define the tunneling splitting @xmath134 at a given value of the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the choice of other parameters in equations ( [ 3 - 17 ] ) is governed by the similar principles as in the pair  single level crossing .",
    "there are at least three different scenaria which may appear .",
    "the first two are realized when the interaction between the two symmetric and the two antisymmetric states is much stronger than the interaction inside each pair which yields the individual pair splittings . if @xmath145 the avoided crossing results in a simple resonance of the splitting ( fig .",
    "4(b ) , parameters @xmath131 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) .    if the symmetric states are interacting stronger ( or weaker ) than their antisymmetric counterparts @xmath152 , two intersections inside one of the two pairs are possible ( fig .",
    "4(c ) , parameters @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath148 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) .",
    "finally , if the interaction between the two symmetric and the two antisymmetric states is much weaker than the interaction inside each pair , the pairs will intersect each other and the avoided crossing structure will appear on a finer scale than the pair splittings .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",

    "we have described and explained peculiar features of dynamical tunneling of a strong excitation in a trimer .",
    "the tunneling amplitude may be enhanced due to the presence of the third site with fluctuating particle number .",
    "numerical calculations show that this amplitude grows about eight orders of magnitude when the coupling parameter @xmath15 still remains much smaller than all other parameters in the system",
    ". an interesting feature of this process is that the third site serves as a donor which injects bosons into the dimer and thus speeds up tunneling .",
    "the injected bosons are of course returned to the third site at the end of the tunneling process .",
    "such a process thus needs a nonzero amount of bosons to be deposited on the third site at the beginning of tunneling .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the observed enhancement of tunneling with our consideration of a tunneling of a breather in a one - dimensional chain @xcite .",
    "the result of that paper was that the interaction of the dimer with other degrees of freedom in the chain may result only in a reduction of the tunneling amplitude .",
    "this finding was in agreement with studies of disspative tunneling @xcite .",
    "the reason for the opposite result in the present work is that we consider a situation in which the third harmonic site is excited to a rather high level and is able to provide bosons necessary to enhance the tunneling .",
    "this is in contrast to the above references where the temperature was assumed to be zero or low , meaning that the bath degrees of freedom were not excited .",
    "note that the discussion in subsection ii.a prompts a possibility of a tunneling enhancement even at zero occupation of the third site .",
    "this can be achieved in our model by choosing @xmath165 with @xmath166 . again",
    "the expected enhancement of tunneling is opposite to the above statement and is due to the choice of such a large value of the frequency @xmath167 of the third site which makes the adiabatic approximation @xcite invalid .",
    "it means that the shape of the instanton calculated in @xcite may be significantly altered by the interaction with this high frequency mode .",
    "the spikes observed in the @xmath15 dependence of the tunneling amplitude are well explained by the relevant crossings with either single levels or with other tunneling pairs of levels . at higher values of @xmath15 when the tunneling splitting comes close to average level spacing ( 1 in our model )",
    "the whole picture becomes more complicated and one may think about an increasing role of chaos assited tunneling @xcite .",
    "however , discussion of this process goes beyond the framework of this paper .",
