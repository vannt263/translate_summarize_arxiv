    "boson stars are self gravitating and localized solutions of a complex scalar field .",
    "these exotic stars are held back from collapsing under their own self gravity by heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "this is in contrast with compact objects like neutron stars where degeneracy pressure ( from pauli s exclusion principle ) prevents the gravitational collapse . despite having no observational evidence ,",
    "these star like configurations are widely studied as black - hole mimickers , dark matter candidates and often as astrophysical compact objects .",
    "if constructed without any coupling to electromagnetic field , they could serve as horizon - less black holes , or if constructed on galactic scales they might act as dark - matter halo .",
    "furthermore , boson - stars share a large number of similarities with neutron stars : both form one parameter family , have similar mass - radius curves and show transition from stable to unstable states at the peak of these curves . because of such similarities",
    ", boson stars are often studied as astrophysical compact objects .",
    "even if they are found non - existent in nature , they could serve as analogs to neutron stars which are sometimes harder to model ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "because of their sheer simplicity , they make perfect tools to explore general relativity . + in order to completely understand the nature of a classical solution such as that of a boson star , it is necessary to probe the dynamics of small perturbations around aforementioned classical solution .",
    "studying the effects of an higher dimensional operator , which can be thought of as one such perturbation at the effective lagrangian level , can be an important way that can shed light not only into the nature of a boson star but also into the nature of the effective field theory itself . in the present paper",
    ", we will take into account a specific form of higher derivative term in the gravity sector and study its static modification on usual minimal boson star solutions .",
    "there exits an interesting generalization of general relativity to an arbitrary number of dimensions , known as lovelock s theory , which contains an action comprising of higher order derivatives .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of this higher derivative theory is that it does not lead to more than two derivatives at the equation of motion level .",
    "theories with more than two derivatives are , in general , plagued by ghosts and consequently their hamiltonians are unbounded from below .",
    "the term quadratic in curvature in lovelock s generalization is called the gauss bonnet term .",
    "boson stars have been extensively studied in gauss bonnet geometry in five dimensions @xcite . however in four dimensions , the gauss bonnet term is a topological invariant and gives no contribution to the equations of motion .",
    "this problem can be avoided by introducing a non - minimal coupling between a complex scalar field and the gauss bonnet term . in order to have global phase rotation invariance , gauss - bonnet modification should couple with the square of the complex scalar field .",
    "boson stars with the non - minimal scalar field coupled to curvature term has been studied earlier by @xcite , where they coupled ricci scalar to square of boson field .",
    "therefore , it would be a simple extension to study the influence of coupling to higher curvature terms .",
    "+ in this work , we will extensively study ground - state boson stars in a scalar - gauss - bonnet ( sgb ) theory .",
    "in addition to standard bs lagrangian , we have a gauss - bonnet term non - minimally coupled to the complex bosonic fields . for simplicity ,",
    "we have not considered any self interaction term for scalar field in the lagrangian .",
    "however , it would be straight forward to extend our analysis if one includes quartic coupling in the scalar sector .",
    "boson stars without self interactions , often called mini - boson stars , have maximum mass of the order @xmath3 .",
    "this is much smaller than the chandrasekhar mass @xmath4 for the fermionic counterparts , where @xmath5 is the mass of the field under consideration . to construct boson stars with larger masses and more particles ,",
    "a repulsive self - interaction term is needed to provide the extra pressure against gravitational collapse .",
    "even though we consider mini - boson stars in this paper , as mentioned the analysis can be easily extended to include the self interaction term needed to reach the astrophysical mass scales .",
    "furthermore , we will mainly concentrate on the solutions with positive coupling constants , for reasons that will be clear as we go along . +",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we present the underlying lagrangian formulation and equations of motion .",

    "note that solutions with negative binding energies are said to be `` classically stable '' .",
    "we will discuss this classical stability in subsequent sections .",

    "however , from the physical point of view , we can always define an effective radius(@xmath31 ) within which the boson star under consideration contains 99% of the total mass(@xmath32 ) .",
    "therefore corresponding effective compactness can be defined as @xmath33 .",
    "+ after stating the boundary conditions , in the following section , we will try to solve the equations of motion([eq : eom ] ) numerically and compute all the aforementioned physical quantities .      in absence of a gauss bonnet term",
    ", boson stars are parameterized by the scalar field value at the origin @xmath34 which attain any arbitrarily large value . in presence of gauss - bonnet term , however , solutions exist only up to a maximum value of @xmath34 . given a value of coupling constant a , there exists a limiting value of @xmath35 , after which solutions do not exist .",
    "similar constraints on the parameter space have been found for boson star in other theories , such as five dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet(egb ) gravity @xcite and fluid stars in einstein - dilaton - gauss - bonnet(edgb ) gravity @xcite .",
    "this criticality appears from the regularity condition of the scalar and metric fields at origin due to higher derivative gravity term . to illustrate this further",

    "nature of solutions of a quartic equation can be determined by its discriminant . for a quartic polynomial of type @xmath46 ( no quadratic term )",
    ", the discriminant is given by    @xmath47    for a generic quartic case , @xmath48 means two complex - two real roots and for @xmath49 , all roots are either real or complex",
    ". equation [ eq : qe ] always has two complex zeros in the regime of interest . consequently , physical solutions exist only for negative discriminant . and as a result , the possible combinations of gauss - bonnet parameter , a and central value of scalar @xmath34 , are now constrained .",
    "as we will see , this imposes an upper bound on @xmath34 for a given coupling constant .",
    "+ solving [ eq : eo1 ] , [ eq : eo2 ] , [ eq : eo3 ] for @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 and accepting only physical solutions , we get the boundary conditions at `` @xmath50 '' , the starting point of numerical domain    ( r_o)=_2 r_o^2 + ( r_o)=_0+_2 r_o^2 + _ 0(r_o)=p_0 + p_2r_o^2 [ eq : bc ] as stated earlier , @xmath40 is the free parameter , while @xmath41 has to be set such that @xmath51 + besides regularity at origin and asymptotic flatness , we also require an asymptotically vanishing energy density .",
    "this can be attained by shooting for a certain value of @xmath6 such that @xmath52 .",
    "requirement of asymptotic flatness , eliminates any role of the gauss - bonnet term at the infinity as the term vanishes in flat space - time .",
    "therefore , in the asymptotically flat space - time limit ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 ) , scalar field equation turns out to be _ 0  + 2 r _ 0",
    "-(m^2-^2 ) _ 0 = 0 .    making sure that both metric fields and amplitude of scalar field vanish at large radial distances , one gets the usual behavior of the scalar field decaying as @xmath56 from the above equation for the scalar field",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]      as has been explained earlier , compactness of a boson star is a measure of the amount of mass contained within the effective radius of the same .",
    "for example , compactness of a schwarzschild black hole is @xmath57 , while the maximum compactness of a non - rotating fluid stars @xmath58 is given by buchdahl limit @xcite .",
    "the compactness of the stable self - interacting boson stars was studied in @xcite for einstein gravity , where they found an upper bound on the ratio m / r to be 0.16 for large self interactions .",
    "we found that sgb boson stars are much more compact than the regular self interacting ones and more than half as compact as the black holes . in sgb gravity , adm mass of a boson star increases with the gauss bonnet coupling , with a negligible decrease in the effective radius @xmath31 .",
    "this fact essentially increases the compactness of the sgb boson stars .",
    "figure [ fig : compact ] displays the compactness of sgb boson stars as a function of coupling parameter @xmath0 . as shown , compactness increases with @xmath0 , reaching an asymptotic value of @xmath59 .",
    "compactness of black hole @xmath57 and maximum compactness of neutron stars @xmath58 and self - interacting bs @xmath60 are also displayed for comparison .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed the boson stars solution in scalar - gauss - bonnet gravity in four dimension .",
    "the action contains a gauss - bonnet term coupled to the square of scalar field amplitude .",
    "our results show that the scalar field can not have arbitrarily high values at the center of the boson star .",
    "this feature is shared by stars in other theories of modified gravity as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "this can be better understood by looking at the behavior of scalar field near the center of a star .",
    "this imposes an upper bound on the value of the scalar field at the origin , @xmath34 .",
    "+ we have studied various interesting properties of boson stars specifically focusing on their dependence on gauss - bonnet coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we studied mass - frequency ( m-@xmath6 ) curves , which no longer have the spiraling feature found in boson stars without scalar - gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "this disappearance of the inspiral can be observed in 5d gauss - bonnet theory as well , even though shape of curve can be qualitatively different from m-@xmath6 diagrams of sgb boson stars .",
    "spirals found in mass - radius diagrams disappear as well and for large enough coupling , mass and radius are quite unique , i.e for a given mass , boson - star has an unique radius .",
    "nevertheless m - r curves maintain an appearance similar to those of neutron stars @xcite and boson - stars in 5d egb gravity .",
    "furthermore , boson star with positive coupling are more massive and due to a slight decrease in radius , they are also more compact .",
    "however in our analysis , we have not included the self - interaction of the scalar field .",
    "the resulting boson stars have masses ( of order @xmath3 ) much smaller than the chandrasekhar mass of fermionic stars ( of order @xmath4 ) . to reach astrophysical mass scales ,",
    "a repulsive self interaction term is needed . since in sgb gravity",
    ", there is a very slight decrease in stellar radius , we believe that inclusion of self interaction can create very compact stars . + a complete stability analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , and is left for our future work .",
    "nonetheless , we have made some comments about classical stability of our boson star configurations .",
    "interestingly for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , binding energy is always negative .",
    "this implies that these stars are immune to decay by dispersion , though they can still collapse into black - holes .",
    "this is very different from 5d egb boson stars which are always classically unstable @xcite .",
