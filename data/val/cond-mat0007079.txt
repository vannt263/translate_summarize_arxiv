    "a number of experimental techniques have emerged in recent years which enable studies of the structure and dynamics of electrode - electrolyte interfaces _ in situ _ , i.e. , without removing the electrode from the liquid @xcite .",
    "this new atomic scale information allows greater understanding of the deposition process where , in contrast to high - vacuum surface - science methods , the electrochemical environment provides direct experimental control over the electrochemical potentials of the adsorbates , rather than over their coverages or fluxes .",
    "these new _ in situ _ experimental techniques , together with new methods to manipulate adsorbates at the interface on the nanometer scale @xcite , promise to make electrodeposition an even more important method for low - cost , high - quality materials synthesis than it is today @xcite .",
    "these developments emphasize the importance of developing theoretical and computational methods to study the dynamical aspects of electrodeposition in microscopic detail .    motivated by these developments in electrochemical surface science , we here present a static and dynamic monte carlo ( mc ) simulation study of a simple system which can serve as a prototype for more complicated ones of applied interest .",
    "this system is a submonolayer of br electrodeposited onto a single - crystal ag(100 ) electrode .",
    "recently it was investigated at room temperature by _ in - situ _ surface x - ray scattering ( sxs ) and chronocoulometry by ocko , wang , and wandlowski @xcite .",
    "that study detected a second - order phase transition between a disordered low - coverage phase at more negative electrode potentials and a doubly degenerate c@xmath0 ordered phase with coverage @xmath1 at more positive potentials .",
    "( this phase has also been observed by low - energy electron scattering ( leed ) for br adsorbed on ag(100 ) in vacuum @xcite . )",
    "the transition was shown to belong to the two - dimensional ising universality class @xcite .",
    "the scattering data @xcite also indicate that br adsorbs at the four - fold hollow sites between the surface ag atoms , consistent with recent _ in situ _ x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) results @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations around the adsorption sites are small , suggesting that a lattice - gas approximation for the adlayer structure and dynamics is appropriate . here",
    "we investigate in detail such a lattice - gas model with a nearest - neighbor excluded - volume interaction and lateral dipole - dipole repulsive interactions @xcite . the dipole interaction strength and the electrosorption valency , which are parameters of the model ,",
    "are estimated by fitting simulated equilibrium adsorption isotherms to experimental chronocoulometric data @xcite .",
    "cyclic voltammograms ( cvs ) at room temperature show two main features @xcite : a broad shoulder at more negative potentials which ends in a sharp peak at more positive potentials . by sxs",
    "it was confirmed that the sharp peak corresponds to a second - order phase transition in the layer of adsorbed br @xcite .",
    "however , the cause of the broad shoulder has been less clear .",
    "it was previously suggested @xcite that interactions with surface water are responsible for the shoulder , but equilibrium mc simulations by koper @xcite , as well as our own work , show the same features in simulations without water .",
    "we show here that the broad shoulder in the simulated cv is due to fluctuations within the disordered adlayer .",
    "locally , these fluctuations resemble other ordered phases with coverage 1/4 , which exist in the model at much lower temperatures .    going beyond these equilibrium simulations ,",
    "we further present a dynamic mc study of the ordering and disordering processes between the disordered phase and the c@xmath0 phase , assuming a perfectly stirred solution so that bulk diffusion effects can be ignored . for ordering",
    ", we expect similar behavior to the random sequential adsorption process of the hard - square model with lateral diffusion @xcite . at late stages of the ordering , this dynamic model is expected to be in the same dynamic universality class as the ferromagnetic @xcite or antiferromagnetic @xcite ising model in zero magnetic field following sudden cooling from infinite temperature to a temperature below the critical point .",
    "these phase ordering dynamics with non - conserved order parameter , often called model a in the literature on dynamics of phase ordering and phase separation @xcite , are driven by the reduction of interface curvature @xcite .",
    "we further present dynamic results for the disordering process and discuss how simulation results for this process can be compared with experiment .",
    "we also apply the dynamic mc algorithm to study sweep - rate dependence in simulated cv experiments .",
    "results are presented for the response of the system to a wide range of sweep rates , and we suggest some comparisons between simulation results and experiment . some preliminary results of this study were included in refs .",

    "the pairwise lateral interactions used here are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the separation of an interacting br pair within the adlayer , measured in units of the ag(100 ) lattice spacing ( @xmath28   @xcite ) , and @xmath29 ( which is negative ) is the lateral dipole - dipole repulsion between next - nearest neighbors .",
    "in other work it has been noticed that reducing the infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion to finite but large values has very little effect on the isotherms @xcite .",
    "all interactions are truncated beyond five lattice spacings to simplify computation .",
    "this truncation can be seen as an approximate cut - off due to screening . with this cut - off , the total interaction energy of a fully ordered c@xmath30 phase is approximately @xmath31 of the interaction energy without a cut - off .",
    "the ag(100 ) substrate provides a square adsorption lattice of hollow sites for the commensurate br adlayer .",
    "the nearest - neighbor excluded - volume interactions give rise to two different sublattices which have a geometry corresponding to the two colors on a checkerboard .",
    "each of the two degenerate c@xmath0 phases can occupy only one of the two sublattices , which we label @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the @xmath32 sublattice coverage is the fraction of occupied sites on sublattice @xmath32 , defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of sites on sublattice @xmath32 and @xmath36 denotes a sum over all sites on that sublattice . the @xmath33 sublattice coverage , @xmath37 , is analogously defined . for this system , there are two linearly independent observables of interest : the total br coverage , @xmath38 , and the staggered coverage , @xmath39 , which is the order parameter for the c@xmath0 phase .",

    "the main purpose of these equilibrium simulations was to obtain adsorption isotherms for parameter estimation by fitting to experimental data .",
    "the most important region of comparison is in the disordered phase , where the fluctuations are small .",

    "no significant differences were noticed between data for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see below ) .",

    "the critical value of the electrochemical potential and the shape of the adsorption isotherm in the disordered phase are quite sensitive to the strength of the long - range repulsive interactions . to determine the dipole interaction strength , @xmath29 , and the electrosorption valency , @xmath23 , we therefore simultaneously compared the simulated room - temperature adsorption isotherm , @xmath48 , with experimental isotherms , @xmath49 , obtained from chronocoulometry @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear fitting method is described in the appendix .",

    "[ fig : exp ] . for the two lowest concentrations ,",
    "the agreement is very good over the whole range of electrode potentials , while the agreement in the ordered phase is somewhat less satisfactory for the highest concentration .",

    "the shoulder has previously been attributed to interactions with surface water @xcite .",

    "this quasi - equilibrium cv is compared with dynamically simulated cvs for different potential sweep rates in sec .",
    "[ sec : cv ] .",
    "having obtained an estimate for the lateral interaction constant by equilibrium simulations at room temperature , we briefly explore the full phase diagram of the model with this interaction strength , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "we expect the phase diagram for this system to be topologically similar to that for the hard - square model with next - nearest neighbor repulsion @xcite ( even though the low - coverage ordered phases in the two systems are different ) .",
    "in addition to the disordered phase and the two equilibrium ordered phases [ the low - temperature c@xmath86 phase with @xmath87 and the c@xmath0 phase with @xmath88 which is observed at all temperatures for sufficiently large @xmath89 , there is also a metastable phase , p@xmath0 with @xmath87 , which lies closely above the c@xmath86 phase in energy . to facilitate equilibration at low temperatures ,",
    "in this simulation we used a heat - bath algorithm which updates clusters @xcite consisting of randomly chosen nearest - neighbor pairs of sites .",
    "the presence of the p@xmath0 phase made low - temperature equilibration very difficult , even with the pair - update algorithm .",
    "other phases with @xmath90 probably also exist as a consequence of the long - range repulsion ; however , we expect these phases to be present only at extremely low temperatures , and their effects should be negligible at room temperature .",
    "the phase boundaries have been determined by ground - state calculations for @xmath91 , by the location of the sharp peak in the quasi - equilibrium cv for @xmath92  k , and by inspection of the pair - update mc sample configurations for @xmath93  k.    the broad shoulder in the cv is caused by configurational fluctuations in the disordered phase , which locally resemble the @xmath87 phases @xcite . at the experimentally unrealistic low temperatures where the c@xmath86 phase is observed in the model , the shoulder breaks up into two transitions between the disordered phase and the c@xmath86 phase .",
    "although the c@xmath86 phase is not experimentally observable in this system , local fluctuations which resemble the @xmath87 phases can be seen in the model in equilibrium at room temperature and should be observable in the diffuse intensity of sxs experiments .",
    "we therefore next present simulated equilibrium sxs intensities in the room - temperature disordered phase at @xmath94 .",
    "we define the structure factor as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the squared absolute value of the complex fourier transform of the real - space adlayer configuration @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the wave vector in the plane of the adlayer ( given in units of the inverse lattice constant , @xmath99 ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath100 can be expressed as the fourier transform of the adsorbate correlation function , @xmath101 .",
    "the fourier transform is normalized such that @xmath102 . in the born approximation ,",
    "the structure factor is proportional to the sxs intensity @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eqs](a ) and ( b ) we show the simulated structure factor for the disordered room - temperature phase at @xmath103  mev , where @xmath94 .",
    "small domains of c@xmath0 , c@xmath86 , and p@xmath0 symmetry are noticeable in snapshots of the adsorbate configurations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : eqs](c ) ] , and they also affect the simulated diffuse scattering intensity . referring to fig .  [",

    "the individual peaks would become narrower and more distinct at temperatures less than room temperature ( but still above the critical temperature for the low - temperature ordered phase ) or with stronger dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "next we investigate the dynamics of the br adlayer using a dynamic mc algorithm .",
    "the microscopic processes considered are adsorption / desorption , in which a particle enters or leaves the adlayer , as well as nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor lateral diffusion .",
    "the thermally activated , stochastic barrier - hopping picture of the microscopic dynamics used here is described in further detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we assume a simple linear form for the local energy landscape , which is equivalent to the butler - volmer approximation with symmetry parameter 1/2 @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : barr ] . the initial and final states , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ,",
    "respectively , are represented by lattice - gas configurations and differ by a single microscopic move .",
    "we label each type of microscopic move ( adsorption , desorption , nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor diffusion ) by the index @xmath113 .",
    "the state @xmath114 represents an intermediate transition state of higher energy between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which is associated with the move @xmath113 .",

    "dynamic monte carlo steps proceed in the following way .",
    "first , a lattice site @xmath6 is randomly selected . if @xmath6 is empty , only adsorption may be attempted .",
    "if @xmath6 is occupied , both desorption and lateral diffusion may be attempted . in general ,",
    "some moves will be excluded by the presence of other adatoms ( corresponding to @xmath122 ) .",
    "next , a weighted list is constructed of new potential configurations @xmath112 which would result from successfully attempting each of the allowed moves for site @xmath6 . the probability to undergo each transition",
    "is then calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynrate ] ) .",
    "blocked moves have transition probability zero . to ensure microscopic reversibility ( detailed balance ) , the possibility that no change in configuration occurs ( @xmath123 )",
    "must also be included in the list of new configurations .",
    "the probability to remain in the initial state is @xmath124 .    in general",
    ", there is a possibility that @xmath125 could be negative .",
    "however , this essentially means that the time corresponding to one mcss is chosen too long for a consistent stochastic description .",
    "thus , @xmath75 must be chosen sufficiently small that @xmath126 remains positive .",
    "as long as this condition is satisfied , changing @xmath75 only corresponds to changing the overall time scale for the simulation . in our simulations we used @xmath77  ( mcss)@xmath121 , which ensured that @xmath126 remained positive with the barriers used here .",
    "the main price paid for the simplicity of coding our algorithm is that it is rather slow in parameter regimes where the acceptance probabilities are very low .",
    "however , except for extremely _ fast _ processes , in which the acceptance probabilities are large and change significantly within a single mcss , it is equivalent to more sophisticated continuum - time algorithms @xcite .    the adsorption / desorption barrier is @xmath127 , the nearest - neighbor diffusion barrier is @xmath128 , and the next - nearest neighbor diffusion barrier is @xmath129 . in the simulations ,",
    "the diffusion barriers are @xmath130  mev and @xmath131  mev , based on _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite of binding energies for a single br ion to a ag(100 ) substrate in vacuum . the barrier @xmath128 is approximated by the difference in binding energy between the four - fold hollow site and the bridge site , while @xmath129 is approximated by the difference in binding energy between the four - fold hollow site and the on - top site .",
    "theoretical estimates of @xmath127 are extremely sensitive to the details of both the ion - surface and ion - water interactions @xcite . based on data from calculations of the potential of mean force for halide ions in water near a cu(100 ) surface @xcite ,",
    "our very rough estimates indicate that values between 200 and 500  mev are not unreasonable . since we also expect @xmath127 to be significantly larger than @xmath129 , we examined some aspects of the behavior for @xmath132  mev and @xmath133  mev .",
    "finding few qualitative differences between simulation results for these two values , we chose the lower value , @xmath132  mev , to increase the simulation speed .",
    "one way to probe the dynamics of an adsorbed layer is to subject it to a sudden change in electrochemical potential .",
    "dynamic simulations of such potential - step experiments are started by equilibrating the room - temperature system at a potential @xmath134 , using the simulation technique described in sec .",

    "the initial rates for all four potential steps are summarized in table 1 .",
    "note that the rates change significantly during the course of the time evolution following each step .",

    "this is only slightly less than the critical coverage , @xmath158 , which is reached in approximately 37  mcss . during this time ,",
    "small , uncorrelated domains of the ordered phase are formed on both sublattices . as the lattice fills up ,",
    "the interfaces between these domains contain empty sites , but the nearest - neighbor exclusion generally prevents the adsorption of additional br ions .",
    "this is followed by the growth of adsorbate domains on the two sublattices which is well described by dynamical scaling ( see below ) . at this stage",
    ", the coverage can increase only where domain walls move together , opening a gap large enough to fit an additional br . in the absence of single - particle diffusion",
    ", the domain walls can move only by a series of very improbable desorption / adsorption events .",
    "however , nearest - neighbor diffusion allows some br ions to diffuse between adjacent domains , thus providing a much faster mechanism for interface motion . for deep steps with the barriers used here ,",
    "interface motion is almost exclusively due to nearest - neighbor diffusion .",
    "excluding very small fluctuations on short time scales , the coverage is always driven toward the equilibrium value , @xmath159 .",

    "the system should grow as a power law with time @xmath161 @xcite , @xmath162 in models with non - conserved order parameter such as the one studied here , the domain growth is driven solely by the tendency to reduce the amount of interface .",
    "for such systems ( known as model a in the nomenclature of critical dynamics @xcite ) @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "we have used two different measures for @xmath160 .",

    "no such competition between degenerate domains exists , and the process is well described by random desorption with diffusion .",
    "study of such disordering processes may provide a way to estimate the adsorption / desorption barrier and obtain a relation between mc time and physical time .    in simulations of cvs for a wide range of potential sweep rates we found a pronounced asymmetry between the positive - going and negative - going scans .",
    "this asymmetry is caused by the differences between the ordering and disordering kinetics .",
    "no simple behavior is seen for the peak separation as a function of the sweep rate , but comparison with experiments suggests that our slowest sweep rate is considerably faster than experimental sweep rates which are in the range of 1 - 10  mv / s .",
