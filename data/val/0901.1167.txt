    "the application of electron beam transport in a cold plasma has been slow , but has made great strides in recent years for a beam focusing device @xcite , laser - guided beam transport problems @xcite , and heavy ion fusion @xcite . in these applications , the @xmath0 hose instability , if it occurs , displaces the beam position from the center of beam propagation . in both a beam focusing device and heavy ion fusion , this can lead to the displacement of the focal point , which may cause the loss of the beam to the wall of the device .",
    "furthermore , instabilities with higher modes ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath1 ) can lead to beam filament .",
    "weinberg @xcite studied a relativistic beam instability with perturbations on a particle orbit which treats all @xmath2 ( azimuthal quantum number ) values to account for beam deformation , and examines various types of unstable modes in the entire frequency range .",
    "resistive instabilities of a charged particle beam penetrating into a plasma channel were studied first by longmire @xcite .",
    "they are complex phenomena and are still not well understood for realistic situations .",
    "the hose ( @xmath0 mode ) instability was studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "they have shown that a relativistic electron beam ( reb ) penetrating into a cold plasma becomes unstable to the @xmath0 mode .",
    "however , their analysis remains valid for a background plasma whose skin depth @xmath3 much larger than the beam radius .",
    "since then a significant progress has been made , the reb propagating in neutral plasmas has been studied extensively by many authors @xcite . because of the mathematical complexity of the problem",
    ", it has been necessary for many authors to adopt simple models which are valid for specific problems , so that the applicability of models remains limited .",
    "in general there are serious difficulties in comparing theoretical analysis of an instability with experiments ( _ e.g. , _ either a z - pinch or a plasma produced by a gas discharge , which is then confined by a magnetic field ) . we incorporate a feasible experimental condition of interest in the theory and compare with experiment .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the feasibility of applying the theory of a beam - focusing ( _ i.e. , _ reconditioning ) in a plasma channel , which is expected to be far more effective than the conventional quadrupole magnet focusing in accelerator technology . the basic idea of the technique involves the self - pinching of a high - current of charged particles by self - magnetic fields @xcite . however , the self - pinched beam is subject to numerous instabilities associated with particle motion as described below .",
    "the previous analysis of beam instability was carried out with a model of a beam penetrating into a cold plasma which is infinite in spatial extent for mathematical convenience . however",
    ", this approach can not be applied to the self - focusing problems for which the background plasma must be finite .",
    "this permits one to impose the boundary condition and thereby to obtain the dispersion relation that gives qualitative information on the stability of the reb .",
    "moreover , it does not apply to the beam focusing by a plasmas in a drift tube confined by an external axial magnetic field in accelerator technology , nor does it tell how the boundaries of a finite plasma channel are formed .",
    "a similar situation occurs in an ion - beam transport in the accelerator technology .",
    "the excessive space - charge is the origin of the beam divergence in a high - current , high - energy proton linac .",
    "one important new problem arises in this connection , however , is how do we overcome the space - charge effect in the absence of a energy booster before injecting the beam into a linac , which has not been addressed in the previous work .",
    "the principal difficulty encountered in the development of the high - current proton accelerator is that a high - current beam must reach a critical energy to overcome the space - charge effect .",
    "this difficulty occurs in a situation for any high - current , high - energy proton accelerator with the direct application of a radio frequency quadrupole ( rfq ) as a beam injector @xcite .",
    "the rfq by kapchinski and teplyakov @xcite makes use of a strong focusing with rf - electrical field , based on the same principle as is used in a quadrupole mass spectrometer , and is basically a homogeneous transport channel with additional acceleration . by the geometrical modulation of quadrupole electrodes , one generates the axial field .",
    "thus the rfq has a linac structure which accelerates and focuses the beam with the same rf fields .",
    "however , the very fact that such axial acceleration is feasible by the geometrical modulation brings with it new difficulties which seem to be formidable .",
    "yet the acceleration by the rfq is independent of beam velocity with a large radial acceptance , which is a great advantage in the design of a proton linac .",
    "thus the devise offers the possibility of utilizing it as a beam injector for a high - current linac . in order to make use of it as an alternative to dc acceleration where a beam injector is required , it is necessary to demonstrate the possibility of reaching energies to about @xmath4 in the rfq before injecting the proton beam for a high - current ( 80ma ) linac such as large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern as shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this prerequisite is determined by solving the equations of motion in the presence of self - field in a quadrupole structure in a linac @xcite .",
    "the energy requirements impose additional restrictions on the feasibility of the lhc at cern .",
    "the requirements have been appreciated for some time now because of our inability to invent a new device that overcome the beam energy requirement for a beam injector for a high - current , high - energy accelerator ; however it was not difficult to overcome the limitation for a low - current accelerator such as the proton accelerator at los alamos ( lampf ) .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the reason for this limitation can be understood , to a great extent , with the observations that the beam focusing force by a quadrupole magnet in a linac is globally a second - order effect , and the geometrical requirements of a high focusing and a large magnetic aperture can not be achieved simultaneously for a diverging high - current proton beam @xcite .",
    "there are several review papers on the progress of rfq @xcite and its wide application in many laboratories .",
    "the maximum attainable beam energy still remains about the same in spite of intense effort to overcome the limitation posed by a high - current , high - energy accelerator .",
    "for example , we give here the numbers for a figure of merits for the lhc planned at cern @xcite ; with @xmath5 input to the rfq , @xmath6 proton beam was accelerated to @xmath7 by rfq , of which @xmath8 proton beam was accelerated through the first linac tank .",
    "subsequent linac tank can not accelerate the high current beam and loses a significant amount of the beam as shown in fig .",
    "1 which was obtained by solving eqs . 13 a - b of courant , livingston and snyder @xcite .",
    "it is this fundamental limitation of rfq that makes it exceedingly difficult to build a high - current , high - energy accelerator such as lhc at cern . in general",
    ", the higher the current density of a proton beam , the higher the injection energy will be in order for quadrupole magnets in a proton linac to transport the beam with a sufficient focusing force .",
    "the calculation of the above energy requirement is most simply carried out by introducing the condition that the particles remain in oscillating orbits in one direction in the presence of self - fields and quadrupole magnetic fields with a given field gradient : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the critical beam injection energy for a given current density , and shows the domain of beam stability .",
    "the occurrence of beam divergence due to the space charge effect is the origin of the beam divergence which results from our attempt to accelerate a high - current beam in a linac , since the focusing force by a quadrupole magnet is not sufficiently strong to overcome the space - charge , which poses the fundamental limitation of the current accelerator technology @xcite .",
    "although the demonstration of successful operation of rfq in low - current proton accelerator at los alamos ( lampf ) has raised a hope of developing a high - energy , high - current proton accelerator , the fundamental difficulty in the development of a high - energy , high - current accelerator is remains unsolved ; that the high - current beam diverges ( bursts ) as it emerges from rfq in a linac is a real challenge to overcome .",
    "this difficulty occurs even if the best possible design parameters of rfq to overcome the coulomb repulsion in the beam are employed @xcite .",
    "yet the problem of space - charge of a high - current beam was the original motivation of kapchinski and teplyakov s concept of rfq as a possible beam injector for a linac .",
    "one important new possibility that arises in this connection , however , is a utilization of self - focusing by a neutral plasma channel which has not been treated in the previous papers .",
    "the existence of the current limitation in the rfq has made it necessary to study the possibility of space - charge compensated beam transport @xcite in the development of a high - current , high - energy proton accelerator such as a large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .    an important question one should ask : is there any method that can be applied to reconditioning the perturbed beam emerging from rfq before injecting it to a linac ? a well - known application of space - charge compensated beam @xcite is an effective , useful concept to overcome the problem of space - charge effect which is the major stumbling block in a high - current beam transport .",
    "the decisive advantage of this approach was demonstrated in a high - current electron accelerator by shielding the space - charge with a quiescent plasma @xcite .",
    "the focusing force may reach to the value , that is greater than that of a super - conducting magnet by several order .",
    "here we assume the presence of an over - dense plasma in which the plasma density is much higher than that of a beam .",
    "thus the coulomb repulsive force due to space - charge in the beam is balanced by the self - field of a bunched beam maintaining a constant radius .",
    "however , the effectiveness of the space - charge neutralized beam transport depends on @xmath16 . consequently , since the beam emerging from rfq is in non - relativistic domain ( @xmath17 ) , the feasibility of a beam reconditioning is out of the question .",
    "this technique can be applied only to a charged particle beam with the velocity @xmath18 by the combined use of the synchrotron as the energy booster .    for some time it has been realized that it might not be possible to make use of the rfq as a beam injector for a high - current high - energy linac @xcite .",
    "the simplest and probably the best , way of accelerating the high - current proton beam is to apply the phase - locking method in the synchro - cyclotron @xcite , but it will be difficult to efficiently extract the high - density beam .",
    "yet it seemed feasible to attempt the experiment with a combination of a synchrotron with the rfq , instead of the betatron injection @xcite , to accelerate the beam to the relativistic domain , in spite of the fact that the beam is being lost in the extraction process .",
    "thus the role of the rfq is promising as a pre - injector for a high - current , high - energy accelerator provided that the beam emerging from the rfq can be reconditioned by a plasma channel described below . in phermex facility at los alamos ,",
    "the high - energy @xmath19-rays are produced by short pulsed high - energy electron beam .",
    "to make a uniformly diverging x - ray source , it is essential to have a highly focused beam , a pencil beam , that can be achieved only by a plasma focusing .",
    "finally , the dependence of @xmath16 on the effectiveness of space - charge compensated beam transport arises from the form of self magnetic filed which is the primary focusing force . since the stability due",
    "to beam modulation has been studied in a plasma channel @xcite and a somewhat more detailed study of the model has been already made by weinberg himself @xcite , here we study the beam reconditioning with the assumption that the beam is accelerated _ somehow _ to the relativistic domain in which there is no beam modulation and is coasting in a plasma channel confined by an _ external magnetic field_. in this process the beam is being reconditioned and is to be transferred to a linac in the next stage of acceleration @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this simple model calculation presents a rather formidable mathematical challenge which defines the ultimate fate of lhc at cern",
    ".    we shall be interested here primarily in the stability of the relativistic beam , in particular , the hose instability of a coasting relativistic beam in a plasma channel confined by the external magnetic field since this is the one which may lead to the loss of charged particles before the beam is injected to the main linac .",
    "an elegant formalism of beam instability is provided by the use of the lagrangian displacement vectors which have been introduced by bernstein , frieman , kruskal and kulsrud in their study of a rayleigh type energy principle for hydro - magnetic stability problems @xcite and is applied to the boltzman - vlasov equation for plasmas by low @xcite . the treatment given by these authors",
    "has shown that the method is indeed very powerful in treating stability problems . here",
    "we make use of the concept of lagrangian displacement vectors @xcite to give an alternative , more mathematically elegant method leading to weinberg s results @xcite in the limit of vanishing external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the present model is essentially equivalent to that of weinberg @xcite , but is different in one major respect , that is , we incorporate the external magnetic field to confine the necessary plasma inside the drift tube , so that we may impose proper boundary conditions .",
    "the space - charge compensated beam transport is essentially the same for both the high - current electron rf linac ( ilc ) and the high - current proton linac ( lhc ) , although it is far more useful to overcome the difficulty of focusing the beam in a proton linac .    with these qualitative remarks as an introduction",
    ", we proceed to the development of the space - charge compensated beam transport in linac .",
    "we therefore focus on the stability of the reb penetrating into a plasma channel confined by a weak external axial magnetic field ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath20 ) , consistent with the experiment @xcite .",
    "since we introduce perturbations in particle orbits which are determined by the external magnetic field and the self - field , it is important to include all the relevant fields in the equations of motion of a particle .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present the essence of our results and some of the details of how the dispersion relation is obtained .",
    "the present work is a generalization of weinberg s work on the general resistive instability @xcite . to make the discussion of our model clearer , we derive the dispersion relation by weinberg @xcite by taking the limit @xmath21 which implies that no external magnetic field applied to the system .",
    "this will illustrate the versatility of the formal application of the lagrangian displacement vectors in the study of beam instability .",
    "it is shown here that , even in the presence of an axial guide magnetic field , the reb remains unstable to various perturbations .",
    "these include the @xmath0 hose instability and the set of the higher modes that are unstable to various perturbations ( type a , b , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , c , d , and @xmath24 ) .",
    "there are two avenues of approach to this problem .",
    "one is to pursue the approach of weinberg @xcite and consider the the first - order effects by the external magnetic field .",
    "though some details of his theory are open to criticism , there is no doubt that the paper points to the right direction for this difficult problem .",
    "however i must confess that i have been unable to follow the early part , `` introduction '' , of his paper .",
    "a brief study of weinberg s paper has convinced me to take a more formal approach that is transparent .",
    "indeed it is much more preferable mathematically to apply a straightforward technique to a complex perturbation problem of a many - body system .",
    "moreover , without a confining external magnetic field , weinberg s model does not allow one to impose the necessary boundary conditions that are essential to derive his dispersion relations , eq . 1 - 9",
    "@xcite and is therefore inconsistent with his object of the problem that he set out to solve .",
    "hence the object of this paper is also to establish what is correct in weinberg s analysis , and to remove some of ambiguities .    to obtain a proper dispersion relation , it is first necessary to specify the unperturbed motion of an electron in the beam .",
    "the reb is assumed to move in the @xmath25-direction with the average velocity @xmath26 .",
    "the self - field is then given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the particle density of the reb .",
    "then the pinch effect can be described by the force ( mhd ) equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hydrodynamic pressure on the beam .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ pinch ] ) is then @xmath31 with the axial pressure @xmath32 @xmath33 hence eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) can be written @xmath34    in addition we define @xmath35 which is equal to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the rotational motion of a coasting beam can be described by the equation of motion in the presence of an external and a self magnetic fields : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "one can easily show from eq .",
    "( [ zero ] ) that the angular frequencies are given by @xmath42.\\ ] ]    hence the transverse motion of a particle in the polar coordinates can be described by the equation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath45 are the lorentz factor and the mass of a charged particle respectively .",
    "if we now define the rotational velocities as @xmath46 , then we can show that @xmath47 , which describes a uniform circular motion of an electron with frequencies @xmath48 in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "furthermore , by taking the landau gauge @xmath50 , the canonical momentum becomes @xmath51 .",
    "the rotational velocities are not a constant of motion ; but the canonical momentum @xmath52 can be related to the hamiltonian of the system @xcite and hence we employ @xmath52 in the derivation of a dispersion relation .",
    "if a beam is in a relativistic motion in the presence of electric and magnetic fields , then its translational motion of a particle in a fluid element must be in a manifestly covariant form @xcite : @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 .",
    "next for a uniform beam with density profile , @xmath55    the rotation frequency is given by @xmath56 we often simply write for a uniform beam @xmath57 if there is no ambiguity .",
    "the treatment of the first - order equations of motion in weinberg s paper did not appear to be in the most convenient form which is difficult to follow through @xcite .",
    "in fact it is almost impossible to introduce an external magnetic field in a formal analysis in weinberg s approach , which is necessary for a systematic study of the beam instabilities in a finite plasma channel .      in this section , first we write down the first - order field equations from the maxwell equations assuming that all variables vary as @xmath58 :    [ maxwell1 ] @xmath59    where @xmath60 .",

    "the displacement @xmath65 is defined by the equation @xmath66 . upon introducing the lagrangian displacement vector @xmath65",
    ", it is possible to expand the velocity in terms of @xmath65 .",
    "this makes it simple to derive the first - order equations of motion in the presence of an external magnetic field and the perturbed fields .",
    "in particular , we must modify the equation of motion for a fluid element that moves with relativistic speed in the presence of electric and magnetic fields as described in eq .",
    "( [ covariant ] ) .",
    "next we expand the velocity to the first - order in @xmath65 defined by @xmath67 , limiting to the fast mode for the time being , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by the following equation .",
    "@xmath70 where we have limited to the fast mode @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ angular ] ) and will repeat the same calculations later for the slow mode @xmath72 to check algebras .",
    "we then derive the first - order equation of motion from eqs .",

    ", we must still find a way of expressing the perturbed beam density in terms of displacement vectors .",
    "a simple alternative method to that of weinberg @xcite is to linearize the equation of continuity : @xmath76 with care on @xmath77 and @xmath78 and then to pick up the first - order terms in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) : @xmath79 where we have used @xmath80 in the expansion and then dropped the subscript from @xmath81 .    returning to eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) with @xmath82 , and expressing @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 which yields the perturbed density @xmath86 . this is exactly the same as weinberg s derivation of the perturbed density which is much more elegant a method of deriving the perturbed density ( eq .  ( 5.10 ) of weinberg s @xcite ) .",
    "hence we write the density perturbation as @xmath87 for a uniform beam .",
    "this is perhaps the most crucial equation that describes the collective effects .",
    "we can impose an appropriate jump condition at the beam - plasma boundary with the equation and derive the first - order equations of motion in terms of the displacement vector @xmath65 in the many - particle system . as mentioned earlier",

    "since the hose instability in a modulated beam that includes the beam bunching in the non - relativistic domain is exceedingly complicated , we limit the hose instability in the relativistic domain in which a model illustrates a charge - compensated beam transport consistent with the experiment @xcite .",
    "moreover , we set aside the question of whether a reconditioning of a relativistic beam emerging from a beam injector can be studied quantitatively with the aid of the coasting beam model in a plasma channel .",
    "hence we leave the question of an appropriate beam injector open for future discussion .    to obtain the desired dispersion relation for a coasting beam for which wake fields are negligible",

    "<S> , we treat all the azimuthal modes in the derivation of the dispersion relation in a finite plasma channel that exhibit many unstable modes , which are classified by weinberg s scheme [ steven weinberg , j. math . * </S>",
    "<S> 8 * , 614 ( 1967 ) ] . to overcome the energy requirement of a beam injector for a high - current , high energy linac </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest to add an energy booster of a compact synchrotron to the rfq . the analysis is then applicable to the charged particle beam transport in a proton accelerator , such as large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern or apt at lanl . </S>"
