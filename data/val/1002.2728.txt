    "in these notes we delineate a new approach to the study of forces between two ( but not limited to two ) neutral atoms mediated by a quantum ( in this case , electromagnetic ) field based on nonequilibrium quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is ostensibly very different from the usual approaches researchers in atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) physics are familiar with in the treatment of atomic - optical systems , and it may at first sight appear to be too cumbersome or complicated to be necessary .",
    "however , with the advances of sophisticated and highly controllable experiments in amo physics made possible by new high - precision instrumentation applied to cold atoms in optical lattices ( see , e.g. , the experiments and the theoretical analysis of @xcite ) or cavities ( with the capability of tracking atoms in real time @xcite ) or nanoelectromechanical systems we are entering an age where traditional theories will soon become inadequate . the present method we introduce has the advantage that it is the amalgamation of both quantum field theory and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , the former is required for quantum field ( customarily referred to as retardation , but there are more involved ) effects , the latter for treating processes involving quantum dissipation and noises . not only can this method reproduce all the effects and forces known in the last century as detailed below @xcite , it can also deal with phenomena and processes more recently brought to central attention from quantum foundational and information processing issues , such as quantum decoherence and entanglement dynamics , including non - markovian processes ( those carrying memories ) which invariably will appear when back - action is taken into consideration . since this method can treat quantum back - action and feedback in a self - consistent manner , it is uniquely adept to quantum control considerations @xcite .    unlike most known treatments of systems in near - equilibrium conditions based on linear or nonlinear response theory",
    "this is a fully nonequilibrium dynamical description of the atoms motion .",
    "although our attention is focussed on the forces between two neutral atoms derived by finding their relative trajectories ( which are determined self - consistently by the atoms interaction with the field and with each other via the field and the field s fluctuations in the presence of the atoms ) , one can also treat radiation reaction , dissipation , and fluctuation phenomena with non - markovian behaviors @xcite . as this paper will hopefully illustrate a small initial investment into this new method can pay bountifully .",
    "we consider an assembly of @xmath0 neutral atoms ( labeled by @xmath1 ) and model the internal degrees of freedom ( idf ) of the @xmath2th atom by a three dimensional harmonic oscillator with coordinates @xmath3 , ( thus describing the atom s spontaneous and stimulated emissions and absorption while interacting with a field ) .",
    "the atoms interact with an electromagnetic field ( from near - field coulomb force to far - field radiation ) with vector potential @xmath4 through a dipole interaction , but not directly with one another .",
    "the force between them arises through field - mediated mutual influences .",
    "the non - relativistic trajectory of the @xmath2th atom is described by @xmath5 which , unlike in most previous treatments , is a dynamic variable ( not prescribed ) determined self - consistently by a negotiation amongst all the other variables @xmath6 .",
    "our interest in this paper is primarily focussed on the center of mass motion of each atom and not on the microscopic details of the other variables .",
    "the open quantum systems @xcite approach can efficiently isolate the desired information about the atom s trajectory through a succession of coarse - graining procedures , as detailed below , which take into account the overall effects ( back - action ) of the remaining variables . using the influence functional method we can incorporate the effects of the microscopic physics of the field and the atom s idf and derive an effective equation of motion for the atom s trajectory from which the force between the two atoms can be extracted by appealing to newton s second law .    in this setup",
    "the dipole moment of the atom modeled by an oscillator is not permanent but only instantaneously non - vanishing .",
    "the uneven distribution of charge in the atom comes from two effects .",
    "first , semi - classically speaking , the magnitude and direction of the nuclear - electron separation ( which is proportional to the dipole moment of the atom ) will unpredictably vary in time even in the absence of quantum fields , and second , in the presence of quantum fields the atom is polarized by electric field fluctuations .",
    "dipole moment fluctuations are the source of the interaction among neutral atoms and are responsible for two types of forces arising from distinctly different physical origin .      in the quantum - field conception of a neutral atom the electronic wavefunction surrounding the nucleus",
    "has a fluctuating component , modeled in our approach by a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator . as a whole",
    "the atom will always remain neutral .",
    "however , in time @xmath7 of the oscillator , due to its quantum nature , lead to an uneven local distribution of charge in an otherwise ( globally ) neutral atom which gives rise to an instantaneous dipole moment that couples to the attending electromagnetic field .",
    "radiation traveling away from the first ( fluctuating ) atom carries information about the orientation of its dipole ( at the time of emission in the past ) which eventually reaches and polarizes the second atom .",
    "the second atom s response to the field leads it also to produce a time - varying electric field that travels back to the first atom and is correlated with the activities of the fluctuating atom s idf , leading to nonvanishing interaction energy .",
    "one can think of the second atom as a transponder which receives a signal from the fluctuating atom and then rebroadcasts it . in this analogy",
    "the fluctuating atom will receive a signal reflected from the transponder atom which encodes its own history .",
    "this is easily conceptualized if we consider the atoms to be so close that the light transit time between them is much greater than all other characteristic time scales governing the dynamics .",
    "in such a case the retarded electric field is well approximated by the the electrostatic field .",
    "thus , an intrinsic fluctuation of the idf of one atom will source a static dipole electric field seen by the second atom .",
    "the second atom is polarized by this external field leading it too to source a dipole field felt by the fluctuating atom .",
    "this process leads to an energetically favorable arrangement of the two atom s dipole moments which gives rise to the attractive force between them .",
    "this type of force due to intrinsic fluctuations in the neutral atoms dipole moments contain two well - known forces : 1 ) the van der waals force , usually used to describe all interactions between neutral atoms and molecules categorically , and 2 ) the london force which arises from the coulombic interaction between atoms without permanent multipole moments and without the consideration of retardation effects ( as casimir - polder force does ) .",
    "we refer to forces of this type as * intrinsic fluctuation forces*.      it goes without saying that the quantum field itself possesses intrinsic fluctuations .",
    "any instantaneously generated local electric field will @xmath8 non - vanishing dipole moments in both atoms .",
    "we classify the interaction of dipole moments induced by the fluctuations of the quantum field as * induced dipole forces*. we suggest making a clean separation between forces arising from intrinsic ( before ) and induced ( here ) fluctuations of the dipole moment of a neutral atom because the physical processes produce quite distinct results , as shown in later sections .",
    "the physical origin of this component of the force is the spatial correlation of field fluctuations .",
    "any given field fluctuation will induce correlated dipole moments for the two atoms , much like a long wavelength water wave on the ocean will raise and lower two nearby buoys in phase .",
    "the excitation of the dipoles by the field will lead to radiation that contains information about the emitter .",
    "when the radiation from one atom reaches the other the correlation between the induced motion of each dipole moment at the time of emission , and subsequent communication of that motion via radiation leads to a nonvanishing interaction energy .",
    "a well known force of this nature is that of casimir - polder ( cp ) @xcite who included considerations of the quantum nature of the field .",
    "this cp force ( there is also the cp force between an atom and a mirror which will be treated in our second paper ) is a generalization of the london description including retardation corrections as well as effects of field quantization  quantization being what imbues the field with its own intrinsic fluctuations .",
    "for a description of the forces between two atoms we need to know only the averaged effect of the quantum field and the oscillator s idf on the atom s trajectory , their details are not of great concern in this quest .",
    "imagine the transition amplitude for the @xmath9 system to evolve from some initial state , @xmath10 to some final state @xmath11 in time @xmath12 where @xmath13 labels the atom s position and @xmath14 is a collective label of the state of all the remaining ( environment ) variables in the total system .",
    "our primary interest is the time development of the atom s center of mass for which the field and its interaction with the atom s idf plays a central role through processes like dissipation and radiation reaction .",
    "for a given final position of the center of mass there can be many consistent final field and oscillator states , likely unobservable .",
    "summing over all final environment states compatible with the atom s motion is @xmath15 when we are ignorant of the final state of the environment whether we choose to ignore those details or they are not measurable .",
    "this leads to an effective transition amplitude for the trajectory of the atom @xmath16 where all environmental effects on the trajectory have been taken into account . carrying out this process of @xmath17 where the final field and oscillator states are traced over leads to an effective action that self - consistently accounts for all back - action of the field and the atom s idf on the atom s trajectory .",
    "the equation of motion for the atom , and thus the atom - atom force can be obtained through a variation of this action @xcite .",
    "as we shall show the present formulation goes beyond previous work in that we can derive the forces between two atoms for fully dynamical and under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "when the spacing between the atoms is held fixed we recover the well - known london and cp forces . for the case where the atoms and field are not in thermal equilibrium",
    "we find a novel far field scaling for the induced dipole force diminishing as @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 , and for the case when the two atom s are entangled we find a novel near field scaling that enters at second order in perturbation theory as @xmath20 as opposed to the standard @xmath21 where @xmath22 quantifies the interatomic distance and @xmath23 the electronic charge .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this nonequilibrium force and the entanglement force behavior have not been reported in the literature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the microscopic details of the system by defining the action describing the dynamics of the entire system .",
    "the worldline influence functional method is adopted where the environment degrees of freedom ( field + oscillator ) are traced over to find the time evolution of the reduced density matrix .",
    "the equations of motion for the atomic trajectories are then obtained from the saddle points of the reduced density matrix . in sec .",
    "3 the explicit form for the atom - atom force is computed , and physical origin of each component is explained . in sec .",
    "4 an initially entangled state for the two oscillators is considered .",
    "it is found that the correlation among the oscillator coordinates leads to a contribution to the atom - atom force that enters at second order in perturbation theory .",
    "5 concerns the possibility of detecting the nonequilibrium atom - atom force ( when the field and atoms are not in thermal equilibrium ) which is new and the novel entanglement force we discovered as outlined in sec . 4 .",
    "we describe the microphysical degrees of freedom of the entire system through the following action    s[_a,_a , a^]= _ a ( s_q[_a]+s_z[_a]+s_int[_a,_a , a^ ] ) + s_e[a^ ] where the sum is over all atoms .",
