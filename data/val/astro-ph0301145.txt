    "the time delay of light , also known as the shapiro effect , is one of the observational cornerstones of general relativity . for a light ray passing a body of mass @xmath5 at location @xmath6 , and",

    "if the ray passes by the body a minimum distance @xmath12 that is small compared to @xmath13 , then @xmath14 the one - way delay amounts to 70 microseconds for a ray that grazes the sun and 10 nanoseconds for a ray that grazes jupiter .",
    "in addition to tests of the time delay by the sun @xcite , the time delay has also been studied in a number of binary pulsar systems ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "advances in precision timekeeping and in vlbi have motivated the study of the first relativistic corrections , of order @xmath2 , to the basic shapiro formula .",
    "these corrections would be relevant for signals passing near moving bodies , such as bodies in binary pulsar systems , or planets such as jupiter . in a series of papers , kopeikin and",
    "colleagues have analyzed these correction effects in detail ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they find that , to first order in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the velocity of body @xmath17 , the corrected expression takes the form @xmath18    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + o\\left ( { gm_a \\over c^3 } { v_a^2 \\over c^2 } \\right ) \\ , , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 where all quantities are to be evaluated at the same moment of time , say , the time of reception of the ray .    for a light ray passing close to jupiter ,",
    "these corrections are small , of order picoseconds or less , but may be detectable with the latest vlbi techniques @xcite .    recently , however kopeikin has argued that , because of the motion of a body such as jupiter during the passage of the light ray , the fact that the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous should have an effect on the time delay @xcite . to study this phenomenon",
    ", he allowed the speed of gravity to be @xmath1 , where @xmath20 ; this would modify the retardation of the gravitational fields used to calculate the time delay .",
    "he argued that eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) would be modified by replacing @xmath21 by @xmath1 in the prefactor @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and in the velocity - dependent term in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite then proposed a test of the propagation speed of gravity via vlbi measurements in the fall of 2002 .",
    "this result goes against intuition .",
    "first , while the retardation of gravity surely has effects , one does not expect to find effects _",
    "odd _ in powers of @xmath2 until the leading effects of gravitational radiation reaction occur , far beyond the order of the @xmath0-dependent effects claimed by kopeikin .",
    "second , the time delay is controlled dominantly by the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath23 ; if this is a retarded potential with speed @xmath1 , it would be given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density of matter .",
    "expanding the retardation in the near zone ( @xmath26 the second term would have been of order @xmath27 relative to the leading term , and might have contributed to the time delay , but it vanishes because of the conservation of mass .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 first appears in the third term , which is of order @xmath28 relative to the first .",
    "this , rather than first order in @xmath27 , is what intuition dictates would be the first level at which retardation - dependent effects occur .",
    "this argument was invoked implicitly in the paper of @xcite .",
    "another argument against such @xmath27 dependent effects comes from electrodynamics .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the electric field of a uniformly moving charge points not toward the retarded position of the charge , but toward the _ present _ position ( see , for example ,  11.10 and exercise 11.17 of @xcite ) . in gravity , because acceleration involves @xmath29 , working to first order in @xmath2 is equivalent to assuming a uniformly moving body , and thus a similar conclusion holds : to order @xmath2 , retardation should have no observable effects .",
    "these considerations have motivated us to check kopeikin s claim with a careful calculation of the time delay to the same order .",
    "we have assumed that , to the post - newtonian order required for the calculation , the metric can be described by a matter gravitational potential @xmath23 and a current gravitational potential @xmath30 , both of which are assumed to be retarded potentials using a speed @xmath1 , as in eq .",
    "( [ uretarded ] ) .",
    "the terms in the metric also are multiplied by suitable parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters to reflect the possibility that , whatever theory one is considering with a different speed of gravity , it will necessarily _ not _ be general relativity , and thus may have different ppn parameter values ( see @xcite for a review of the ppn framework ) .",
    "in such a theory , those ppn parameters may well depend on @xmath1 , but in the absence of a specific theory , we leave them general .",
    "we then calculate the time delay to order @xmath31 , for a signal emitted from a distant source and received on earth , passing through the gravitational field of the solar system .",
    "we carefully treat the propagation of the light ray both through the far zone , where the propagation time is long compared to the dynamical time of the system , and through the near zone , where the propagation time is short compared to the dynamical time , and where positions and velocities can be expanded about values at some common time , such as the time of reception on earth .",
    "our result closely parallels eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) : @xmath32    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + o\\left ( { gm_a \\over c^3 } { v_a^2 \\over c^2 } \\right ) \\ , , \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the first important observation is that @xmath1 appears nowhere in this expression .",
    "although it appears in various intermediate expressions , it _ cancels _ in the end , to the order of approximation shown .",
    "in addition to the overall factor of @xmath34 , which is standard , the only change comes in the coefficient @xmath35 in front of the velocity - dependent term in the prefactor . here",
    "@xmath36 is a function of the ppn parameters @xmath4 and @xmath37 , given by @xmath38 in general relativity , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and we recover kopeikin s result , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .    secondly , the velocity dependent corrections in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) have a simple physical interpretation .",
    "since we are working to first order in @xmath2 , only jupiter s rectilinear motion is relevant ; its acceleration generates effects higher order in @xmath3 .",
    "the vector @xmath33 is simply the spatial unit vector of the photon s direction _ as seen in the rest frame of jupiter _ ; the correction terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) are nothing but the effect of aberration .",
    "they depend only on @xmath21 , which is the velocity relevant for lorentz transformations and the propagation of light , not on @xmath1 . indeed , from the viewpoint of jupiter s rest frame",
    ", @xmath1 is completely irrelevant , since the gravitational field is static ( again , ignoring jupiter s acceleration ) .",
    "the velocity - dependent prefactor is a combination of a gravitomagnetic effect ( the fact that the gravitational field is not a scalar quantity , but contains both a vector and tensorial part ) and a simple doppler effect in transforming from jupiter s rest frame to the barycentric frame .",
    "we thus conclude that the @xmath2 corrections to the shapiro time delay are normal 1.5pn corrections that occur when there are moving bodies , but that they have _ nothing _ to do with the speed of propagation of gravity , insofar as it affects the retardation of gravitational interactions . furthermore , as a potential test of alternative gravitational theories , measuring these @xmath2 terms is not promising , because a variety of solar system measurements already constrain @xmath4 and @xmath37 to such a degree that @xmath41 under relatively weak assumptions or @xmath42 under assumptions that invoke so - called `` preferred - frame '' tests of the parameter @xmath4 ( see @xcite for the latest bounds on the ppn parameters ) .",
    "in fact , the vlbi measurements are sensitive mainly to the velocity dependence in the logarithmic term , not to the prefactor .",
    "therefore , measurements of the propagation of radio waves past jupiter do not directly constrain the propagation speed of the gravitational interaction .",

    "we assume that , whatever theory of gravity is in force , it is a _",
    "theory , that is it has a spacetime metric @xmath43 that governs the interactions and motions of all non - gravitational fields and all `` test '' particles .",
    "in particular , we will assume that light rays move on null geodesics of the spacetime metric .",
    "we will assume that atomic clocks measure proper time as given by the invariant interval of the spacetime metric . by choosing the units determined by such physical measurements appropriately",
    ", we may make the speed of light as measured by any freely falling observer unity .",
    "henceforth we will use units in which @xmath44 .",
    "we then assume that the theory of gravity has a post - newtonian limit that can be written in the following form : @xmath45 where @xmath23 and @xmath46 are retarded gravitational potentials given by @xmath47 where @xmath25 and @xmath48 are the density and velocity of matter , and where we have inserted @xmath1 in the retardation expression to reflect the possible difference between the speed of propagation of gravity and that of light ( unity ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is a bookkeeping parameter inserted to keep track of `` orders of smallness '' of various quantities , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and so on .    to the orders of approximation shown , the metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) is general enough to encompass a broad class of metric theories of gravity with a propagation speed of gravity different from unity , with the exception of `` massive graviton '' theories @xcite , whose gravitational potentials also include yukawa - like modifications . in the special case of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath53 ,",
    "the metric corresponds precisely to that of linearized general relativity in harmonic gauge , to the order considered .",
    "there are two free ppn coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath4 ; the coefficient of @xmath23 in @xmath54 has been chosen to be unity as usual by our choice of the measured value of the gravitational constant .",
    "we ignore all `` preferred frame '' terms that could appear in the ppn metric ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "notice that the terms ignored in each metric component are all @xmath55 larger than the terms kept ; no correction terms a `` half - order '' higher are present , such as @xmath56 terms in @xmath54 or @xmath57 , or @xmath58 terms in @xmath59 .",
    "this has certainly been true for all those theories analysed by the present author or by others to date , including several , such as the rosen bimetric theory , with @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "such correction terms generically arise from non - linear terms in the field equations , which are minimally of order @xmath61 higher than the leading term , or from @xmath62 corrections in the definition of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "however , the retardation effects in the potentials could in principle lead to such `` half - order '' terms in a slow - motion expansion .",
    "it is precisely these terms whose effects we wish to explore .    before proceeding , however , we emphasize that we have assumed a specific theoretical framework for the analysis .",
    "relatively few theories with @xmath63 have been analysed within the ppn framework ( the rosen theory and a few others ) .",
    "furthermore , it is entirely possible that @xmath20 theories may be more fully or consistently realizable in the context of non - metric theories , for which the ppn framework is not applicable . in the absence of a concrete example",
    ", we will restrict attention to the ppn approach described above .    in a metric theory of gravity ,",

    "although the event corresponding to @xmath110 ( closest approach ) is different for each body , the effect of these differences on @xmath16 is of order of the acceleration of each body , which is @xmath55 , hence we can evaluate @xmath128 at the same coordinate time for each body , say , the time of reception of the ray .",
    "but , because @xmath170 in barycentric coordinates , the net effect of this @xmath1-dependent term vanishes .",
    "similarly , for a given light ray , the time @xmath160 is a constant , independent of the body . the difference between the various values of @xmath171 for different bodies has an effect only at order @xmath49 , so again , summing over all the bodies in the system causes the velocity correction to the @xmath172 term to vanish .",

    "we have shown that the speed of propagation of gravity has no direct influence on the time delay of light to 1.5pn order .",
    "the only effect comes from any modification of the ppn parameters that might arise in a theory with a different propagation speed .",
    "this contradicts claims made by @xcite .",
    "in addition , existing solar - system experiments already place sufficiently strong bounds on the ppn parameters @xmath37 and @xmath4 that even the potential difference from gr in the 1.5pn correction represented by the parameter @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) must be small .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is known to be unity to a part in 1000 from standard time delay and light deflection measurements , while @xmath183 from analyses of lunar laser ranging @xcite and binary pulsar data @xcite .",
    "the latter bounds assume that the solar system and the relevant binary pulsar are moving with respect to the cosmic background radiation with known velocities of order 300 km / s , and that , in any theory of gravity with @xmath184 , the rest frame of that radiation coincides with a cosmological preferred frame .",
    "such a frame is to be expected in a theory of gravity in which @xmath20 for the following reason : in a theory with either interacting dynamical fields or with non - dynamical `` prior - geometrical '' fields , the speed of gravity is presumably a function of some cosmological values of the fields in the theory .",
    "but because @xmath63 , its value depends on the velocity of the frame in which it is measured .",
    "there must therefore exist some frame in which @xmath1 takes its value directly from the cosmologically induced values of the underlying fields  the only logical frame is the mean rest frame of the universe , and hence the rest frame of the cbr .",
    "then , if @xmath184 , there will be measurable effects in any system that moves relative to this preferred frame . with these strong bounds , @xmath185 .",
    "nevertheless a weaker bound on @xmath4 can be inferred from experiments without appealing to preferred - frame effects .",
    "we assume only that the theory is a lagrangian - based theory of gravity , so that it possesses suitable conservation laws for total momentum and energy . then , lunar laser ranging tests of the nordvedt effect bound the combination @xmath186 . the perihelion advance of mercury combined with the existing bounds on @xmath37 yield @xmath187 ;",
    "earth tide measurements force the bound @xmath188 .",
    "one is then left with the relatively generous bound @xmath189 .",
    "all bounds on @xmath190 come from considerations of preferred - frame effects .",
    "thus without appealing to preferred - frame tests , one would have to have an extraordinary cancellation between @xmath4 and @xmath190 to conform to nordtvedt effect measurements , while still making @xmath36 large enough to make a measurable difference in eq .",
