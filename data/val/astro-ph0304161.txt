    "the hh 110 herbig - haro jet was discovered by reipurth & olberg ( 1991 ) , and it presents a complex structure of aligned knots , which opens out with an unusually large angle of @xmath3 .",
    "while hh objects such as hh 34 or hh 111 show aligned knots with more or less organized , arc - like shapes , hh 110 has a more chaotic structure , more reminiscent of a turbulent flow .    a possible explanation for the fact that hh 110 is different from other hh jets has been proposed by reipurth , raga & heathcote ( 1996 ) , who suggested that hh 110 is the result of a deflection of the adjacent hh 270 jet ( which travels approximately in an e - w direction ) through a collision with a dense molecular cloud core .",
    "this interpretation was supported by the fact that while the source of the hh 270 jet is detected in the radio free - free continuum , no such source is detected along the hh 110 axis ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1998 ) . also , infrared images show h@xmath4 emission concentrated on the w side of the hh 110 jet ( davis , mundt & eislffel 1994 ; noriega - crespo et al .",
    "1996 ) , which would correspond to the region in which the jet is in contact with the dense cloud which produces the deflection . against the jet / cloud collision scenario",
    "are the results of choi ( 2001 ) , who do not find molecular ( hco@xmath5 ) emission around the jet / cloud impact point , as might be expected .",
    "there are a series of papers which describe analytic and numerical models meant specifically for hh 110 as a jet / cloud impact flow ( raga & cant 1995 ; de gouveia dal pino 1999 ; hurka , schmid - burgk & hardee 1999 ) .",
    "the latest models of this object are the ones of raga et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who have carried out the most detailed simulations up to now of this object , and computed h@xmath0 and molecular hydrogen emission maps which agree with the observations in a qualitatively successful way .",
    "these authors also suggest that the point at which the hh 270 jet is currently impacting the cloud might have moved westwards of the hh 110 axis ( i. e. , deeper into the cloud ) , which would explain the lack of hco@xmath5 emission in the crossing region of the hh 270 and hh 110 axes .    in a recent paper ,",
    "riera et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have discussed the kinematics and excitation along and across the hh 110 outflow , as derived from long - slit spectra obtained with 5 slit positions ( one along and four across the outflow axis ) , finding very complex structures . in the present paper , we discuss new fabry - prot data which cover only the h@xmath0 line , but give a full spatial coverage of the well resolved hh 110 outflow .",
    "the full spatial coverage of the position - velocity cube obtained from our data allows us to carry out a somewhat novel analysis ( at least , in the context of hh objects ) .",
    "as the observed spatial and kinematical structures are very chaotic , and appear to defy a direct description , we have chosen to describe these structures through a wavelet analysis .",
    "a wavelet transform of an image gives information similar to the one that could be obtained from a more standard fourier analysis , but also preserves the spatial information .    in this way one can obtain , for example , the characteristic sizes ( along and across the outflow axis ) of the knots as a function of position along the jet .",
    "this kind of information could also be retrieved by carrying out fits to the intensity profiles of the knots ( e. g. , with anisotropic gaussian functions , as has been done in the past for other objects by raga , mundt & ray 1991 ) , but such an approach is impractical for an object as complex as hh 110 , in which knots of different shapes coexist across the sections of the outflow .",
    "we therefore obtain a position - velocity cube from our fabry - prot observations ( described in  2 ) , and obtain velocity channel maps from which we compute an h@xmath0 image , as well as radial velocity and line width maps ( see  3 ) .",
    "we then carry out an anisotropic wavelet analysis of the h@xmath0 image , and determine the spatial scales present in the map as a function of position along the outflow (  4 ) .",
    "we then study the variations of the line width and the radial velocity of the emission as a function of spatial scale and of position along and across the jet (  5 ) .",
    "finally , we interpret this kinematic information in terms of a `` mean flow+turbulent eddy '' model of a turbulent jet ( or wake ) , and use the model to deduce the mean flow parameters that are relevant for the hh 110 jet (  6 ) .",
    "the results are then summarized in @xmath6 .",
    "the observations were obtained at the european southern observatory 3.6 m telescope in january 1997 . the fabry - prot instrument cigale was used .",
    "it is composed of a focal reducer ( bringing the original f/8 focal ratio of the cassegrain focus to f/2 ) , a scanning fabry - prot and an image photon counting system ( ipcs ) .",
    "table 1 contains the journal of the observations .",
    "we have used a fabry - prot with an interference order @xmath7 ( 380 km s@xmath2 ) and a _ finesse _ @xmath8 .",
    "the ipcs , with a time sampling of 1/50 second and zero readout noise , makes it possible to scan the interferometer rapidly , avoiding sky transparency , air - mass and seeing variation problems during the exposures and thus has several advantages over a ccd for this application .",
    "the exposure time per elementary channel was 5 seconds .",
    "several observations of hh  110 have been obtained in h@xmath0 during 2 nights .",
    "the two sets of observations in the h@xmath0 line have been done using 2 different interference filters in order to check if the shape of the interference filter affects the shape of the h@xmath0 profiles .",
    "a @xmath9  s exposure was obtained with a @xmath10  (central wavelength ) and @xmath11    ( fwhm of transmission function ) filter , and a @xmath12  s exposure was obtained with a @xmath13    and @xmath14    filter .",
    "the reduction of the data cubes was performed using the cigale software .",
    "the data reduction procedure has been extensively described in amram et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained by scanning the narrow ne 6599   line under the same conditions as the observations .",
    "velocities measured relative to the systemic velocity are very accurate , with an error of a fraction of a channel width ( @xmath15 3 km s@xmath2 ) over the whole field .",
    "the signal measured along the scanning sequence was separated into two parts : ( 1 ) an almost constant level produced by the continuum light in a narrow passband around the line and ( 2 ) a varying part produced by the line .",
    "the continuum level was taken to be the mean of the three faintest channels , to avoid channel noise effects .",
    "the integrated line flux map was obtained by integrating the monochromatic profile in each pixel .",
    "the velocity sampling was 16 km s@xmath2 .",
    "strong oh night sky lines passing through the filters were subtracted by determining the level of emission from extended regions away from the hh object ( laval et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the velocity channel maps obtained from the fabry - prot data of hh 110 .",
    "we detect h@xmath0 emission in heliocentric radial velocities ranging from @xmath16 to + 80 km s@xmath2 , with peak intensities in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 km s@xmath2 channel maps .    from the line profiles at each position ,",
    "we have computed the velocity of the emission peak ( with a parabolic fit ) and the fwhm ( with linear fits to the sides of the line profiles ) , as well as the line flux ( by adding the fluxes of the individual channels ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0 map obtained from the present data looks similar to previously published h@xmath0 images of this object , showing a complex structure of knots that broadens out to the south .",
    "the radial velocities have low values ( @xmath19 km s@xmath2 ) , with more negative values to the south ( see fig .",
    "the radial velocity structure across the jet is complex , showing variabilities which do not appear to show systematic trends . these results are qualitatively consistent with the radial velocities of this flow which have been previously obtained from long - slit spectroscopy ( reipurth et al .",
    "1996 ; riera et al .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath0 line ranges from 50 to 100 km s@xmath2 , and also shows a complex spatial structure ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    because of the complexity of the observed structures , we have carried out an analysis based on wavelet transforms , which allows us to obtain a general description of the flow without attempting a somewhat hopeless `` knot by knot '' description of the observations .",
    "wavelet transforms have been used in different astrophysical contexts . for example , gill & henriksen ( 1990 ) have used wavelet transforms to describe the complex structures observed in co radial velocities of molecular clouds . obtaining a description of the complex structure of the hh",
    "110 jet belongs to the same class of problem , i.e. , identifying the characteristics of complex spatial structures without loosing the positional information .",
    "therefore , we have applied a wavelet transform analysis to our fabry - prot data .",
    "a 2d wavelet transform analysis of the h@xmath0 image of hh  110 can be used to obtain the positions of all of the `` knots '' , as well as their characteristic sizes .",
    "this kind of procedure is described , e.  g. , in the book of holschneider ( 1995 ) .",
    "once we have obtained the positions and the characteristic sizes of the h@xmath0 structures of the hh 110 jet from the wavelet spectrum , we calculate the spatial averages of the deviations of the line center velocity and if the line widths ( averaging over the characteristic sizes of the structures ) in order to study the turbulence in the hh 110 jet ( see  5 ) .",
    "this procedure is completely equivalent to the one followed by gill & henriksen ( 1990 ) .",
    "an interesting difference between our case and the `` turbulent molecular cloud '' study of gill & henriksen ( 1990 ) is that a jet flow has two clearly defined directions  : along and across the flow axis .",
    "because of this , it is reasonable to expect that the characteristics of the structures along and across the flow axis might differ . to allow for this effect ,",
    "we first rotate the h@xmath0 image so that the flow axis is parallel to the ordinate . on this rotated image",
    ", we then carry out a decomposition in a basis of anisotropic wavelets , which have different sizes along and across the outflow axis .",
    "in particular , we have used a basis of `` mexican hat '' wavelets of the form @xmath20",
    "where @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the scale lengths of the wavelet along the @xmath24- and @xmath25-axes , respectively . after trying several different possibilities , we have chosen a @xmath26 normalization .",
    "it is possible to use other normalizations ( e.  g. , @xmath27 ) , which lead to slightly different results , as the power is rearranged over different regions of the wavelet spectrum .",
    "however , the positions of the different peaks of the wavelet spectrum ( see below ) are not strongly affected by the choice of normalization .",
    "the process that is carried out in order to compute the wavelet transform is to choose a range for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( which are taken to have integer values of pixels ) .",
    "for all of the possible @xmath28 pairs we then compute the convolutions @xmath29 where @xmath30 ^ 2 + [ ( y^\\prime - y)/a_y]^2 \\}^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath31 is the observed map as a function of the pixel position @xmath32 .",
    "these convolutions are calculated with a standard fft algorithm .    with this process",
    ", we then produce the transform maps @xmath33 , corresponding to versions of the observed map @xmath34 which have been smoothed with the different @xmath35 wavelets .",
    "these maps can be used as follows .",
    "we first fix a position @xmath25 along the observed jet . keeping this value of @xmath25 fixed , we find the finite set of values @xmath36 corresponding to the position across the jet and the spatial scales ( across and along the jet ) at which the wavelet transform has local maxima in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 dimensions as well as in either the @xmath24 or in the @xmath25 dimensions . in this way , for each @xmath25 we detect the positions @xmath37 of the knots ( which correspond to intensity maxima either along or across the jet axis ) , as well as their characteristic sizes ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) . in practice , at many positions @xmath25 along the jet one finds a single maximum , but in some positions up to three maxima are found , corresponding to different structures observed across the hh 110 jet .",
    "the results obtained with the process described in  4.1 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "this figure shows the h@xmath0 image ( see  3 ) , which we have rotated by 13@xmath40 so that the outflow is more or less parallel to the @xmath25-axis .",
    "we have then convolved this map with a set of wavelets with @xmath41 pixels ( with @xmath42 per pixel ) and @xmath43 pixels .",
    "the values of the peaks @xmath37 of the wavelet transform obtained for each position @xmath25 along the jet are shown in the right hand panel of figure 3 . also shown ( as error bars )",
    "are the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to each peak , which give an estimate of the characteristic sizes ( across and along the jet , respectively ) of the observed structures .    in order to quantify the observed broadening of the jet , for each position",
    "@xmath25 we compute the weighted mean of the @xmath24-spatial scale ( perpendicular to the outflow axis ) : @xmath44    figure 4 shows @xmath45 as a function of position @xmath25 along the hh 110 flow . in this figure , @xmath46 corresponds to the position of the peak of knot a , and @xmath25 grows moving south along the hh 110 axis .",
    "from knot a to the middle of knot @xmath47 , @xmath48 grows from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . for",
    "@xmath51 increases more or less monotonically from @xmath50 to @xmath52 , for @xmath53 shows a more or less constant value with a small dispersion ( with @xmath48 values ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ) . for @xmath56",
    ", @xmath48 shows a wide dispersion , with values ranging from @xmath57 up to @xmath52 .",
    "if we draw a straight line in figure 4 , passing through the peak @xmath48 of knots a and l , we see that it forms an upper envelope to all of the values of @xmath45 in this region ( which includes all knots from a to l ) . from this upper envelope",
    ", we deduce that the emitting region ( from @xmath58 ) broadens with a half - opening angle of 10@xmath40 .",
    "finally , in figure 5 we show the @xmath39 as a function of @xmath38 for different regions along the hh 110 jet .",
    "we plotted together the points with values of @xmath25 in five different intervals along the jet beam ( knots a - h , i - n , o - q , r@xmath59-r@xmath4 and s , corresponding to the @xmath25-intervals given in table  2 ) .",
    "we find that for knots a - h , the @xmath39 ( i. e. , the spatial scales along the outflow axis ) range from 1 to 18@xmath60 , while the @xmath38 ( i. e. , the spatial scales across the outflow axis ) have values of up to 15@xmath60 .    for knots i - n , the @xmath38 values are either smaller than 6@xmath60 or larger than 12@xmath60 .",
    "interestingly , the intermediate scales , which are detected in other regions of the jet , do not appear as local maxima in the wavelet spectrum , and are therefore not picked up by the analysis described in  4.1 .    while basically no correlation is seen between the @xmath39 and @xmath38 values in knots a - n , at larger distances from the source ,",
    "these values appear to be correlated . for knots o - q ,",
    "the points more or less fall on a @xmath61 line , even though there is a wide scatter for @xmath62 .",
    "for knots r@xmath59-r@xmath4 , the points roughly fall on @xmath63 line , with the exception of few points which show large scales along and across the beam of the jet .",
    "therefore , we see a transition from structures that are elongated along the outflow axis ( for knots o - q ) to transversally oriented structures ( for knots r@xmath59-r@xmath4 )",
    ". there are , however , some elongated structures at knots o - q , and some large structures both across and along the beam of the jet at the location of knots r@xmath59-r@xmath4 ( see fig . 5 ) . finally , for the s - shaped structure ( at @xmath64 , which we have labeled s ) both axially elongated and transversal structures appear to be present .",
    "in order to describe the spatial dependence of the kinematical properties of the hh 110 flow , we compute two different moments of the line profiles : @xmath65 @xmath66 for each spatial pixel of the position - velocity cube . in these equations , @xmath67 is the radial velocity , and @xmath68 the intensity ( at a fixed position @xmath69 ) of the successive channel maps .",
    "we carry out the integrals over the radial velocity @xmath70 by replacing them with sums over the velocity channel maps .",
    "@xmath71 ( see equation [ vcd ] ) is the barycenter of the line profile ( which from now we will call the `` line center '' radial velocity ) , and @xmath72 ( equation [ w2d ] ) is a second order moment that reflects the width of the line profile .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath72 is quite strongly affected by the h  ii region ( which is particularly bright in the surroundings of the faint s region , see figure 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we have subtracted this emission by fitting a linear dependence between the fluxes ( seen in each channel map ) in two rectangular regions ( with a @xmath73 width ) on each side of the hh  110 jet .    with the values of @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 computed for all positions @xmath32 on the plane of the sky , we then compute the following spatial averages : @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 ^ 2 i ( x^\\prime , y^\\prime ) dx^\\prime dy^\\prime \\over \\int_{s_{a_x , a_y } } i ( x^\\prime , y^\\prime ) dx^\\prime dy^\\prime } ,   \\label{dvavd}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the h@xmath0 flux obtained from co - adding all of the channel maps .",
    "these integrals are carried out over areas @xmath78 which are ellipses with central positions @xmath32 and major / minor axes @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponding to all of the wavelets that have been identified as peaks of the wavelet spectrum ( see  4.1 and figure 3 ) .",
    "@xmath79 corresponds to the line width spatially averaged over the ellipse @xmath78 with a weight @xmath77 ( see equation [ wavd ] ) .",
    "we then compute the average of the line center velocities @xmath80 within the ellipse , as well as the standard deviation @xmath81 of these velocities ( see equations [ vavd ] and [ dvavd ] ) .",
    "such deviations of the line center velocity , averaged over sizes chosen from a wavelet spectrum , have been previously used by gill & henriksen ( 1990 ) to study turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "we then obtain values for @xmath82 , @xmath80 and @xmath83 at all of the central points of the wavelets shown in figure 3 ( corresponding to peaks in the wavelet spectrum ) .",
    "in figure 6 , we show the line centers , widths and standard deviations as a function of position @xmath25 along the jet ( all of the points at different positions @xmath24 across the jet beam and with different @xmath22 and @xmath23 are plotted ) .",
    "@xmath80 as a function of position @xmath25 shows quite a wide scatter , and a general trend of more negative velocities from knot a ( @xmath84 km s@xmath2 ) to knots p - q @xmath85 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "if we measure these radial velocities with respect to the surrounding molecular cloud ( with a heliocentric radial velocity of + 23 km s@xmath2 , see reipurth & olberg 1991 ) and correct for an orientation angle of 35@xmath40 with respect to the plane of the sky ( riera et al .",
    "2003 ) , we then obtain that the ( de - projected ) jet velocity grows from @xmath86 to @xmath87 100 km s@xmath2 from knot a out to knots p - q .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results obtained from long - slit spectra by riera et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    at larger distances",
    "@xmath88 , @xmath89 grows , reaching @xmath90 at @xmath91 , and then remaining with slightly negative values up to the end of the detected emission .",
    "we believe that this behaviour of @xmath89 for @xmath92 could be a result of changes in the orientation angle of the outflow with respect to the plane of the sky ( because in this region , substantial side - to - side excursions of the jet beam are observed on the plane of the sky , see figure 3 ) , and might therefore not reflect a real slowing down of the jet flow .    the standard deviation @xmath81 of the line center velocity ( see figure 6 ) appears not to have any dependence on position @xmath25 along the jet beam ( showing values mostly within the 7 to 15 km s@xmath2 range ) out to knot @xmath93 . beyond knot n",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath81 shows a more or less monotonic growth , reaching a value of @xmath95 km s@xmath2 at @xmath96 .",
    "the average line widths @xmath97 do not show a systematic trend with position along the jet , mostly staying within a range from 35 to 45 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this width of course includes the instrumental profile , which has a value of @xmath98 km s@xmath2 .",
    "an interesting feature is that many of the points in the @xmath80 , @xmath99 and @xmath97 vs. @xmath25 plots ( see figure 3 ) appear to fall on more or less monotonic curves .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the complex structure of the hh  110 outflow .",
    "as might be expected , the points which fall on the monotonic curves are the spatial averages corresponding to the wavelets with larger sizes ( @xmath100 , see figures 4 and 5 ) , which naturally give a smoother dependence of the average quantities as a function of position along the jet .",
    "the fact that the averages over sizes of @xmath101 give smooth curves as a function of position indicates that the kinematical properties of the flow have structures only in sizes @xmath102 , which are superimposed on a smooth dependence on position along the jet axis . to some extent , this result is a quantification of the fact that while the h@xmath0 intensity map of hh  110 has complex , high contrast structures with many different spatial scales , the radial velocity and line width maps of this object only show small scale structures which are superimposed on a generally smooth distribution as a function of position along the jet ( see figure 2 ) .    in figure 7",
    ", we plot the line centers , widths and standard deviations as a function of position @xmath24 across the jet ( all of the points with different @xmath22 and @xmath23 are plotted ) .",
    "we plotted together the points with values of @xmath25 in five different intervals along the jet beam ( given in table  2 ) .",
    "@xmath80 shows basically flat structures as a function of @xmath24 ( i. e. , across the jet beam ) in the regions of knots a to n. for the three regions at larger distances from the source ( o - q , r@xmath59-r@xmath4 and s ) , either growing or decreasing @xmath80 vs. @xmath24 trends are seen .",
    "the average line width @xmath103 shows basically no trend as a function of @xmath24 .    for knots",
    "a - n , the dispersion of the line center @xmath81 shows a central region ( with @xmath104 with values ranging from zero to 12 km s@xmath2 , and two outer peaks ( with @xmath105 with larger velocity dispersions of up to @xmath106 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the central , low velocity dispersion region therefore has a diameter of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 cm at 460 pc ) , and is surrounded by a high velocity dispersion envelope with an outer diameter of @xmath109 ( @xmath110 cm ) .    finally , in figure 8 we show the values of @xmath111 and @xmath103 as a function of the size @xmath22 ( across the jet beam ) of the ellipses over which the averages have been computed .",
    "again , we divide the points into the five chosen regions along the outflow axis .    from figure 8 , it is clear that both @xmath99 and @xmath82 show very clear trends as a function of the size scale @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath97 values are approximately constant as a function of @xmath22 , and show a decreasing scatter for larger @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath99 values also show a decreasing scatter as a function of @xmath22 , but this decrease in scatter is superimposed on a shallow trend of increasing @xmath83 vs. @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , in this representation ( of @xmath83 and @xmath103 vs. @xmath22 ) , the line widths and central velocity variations show a quite systematic behaviour . because of this , we choose this particular representation in order to try to interpret the kinematical characteristics of the hh 110 jet .",
    "this is done in the following section .",
    "it is not inmediately clear what the observed line widths and radial velocity dispersions as a function of spatial scale are actually telling us . in order to interpret these results",
    ", we use a simple , analytic model ( described in cant , raga & riera 2003 ) , which allows at least a partial understanding of the implications of the observations .",
    "this model is as follows .",
    "it is known from laboratory experiments that the mean flow velocity of a turbulent jet or wake has a centrally peaked cross section .",
    "superimposed on this flow are the turbulent fluctuations , which can not be modeled in detail .",
    "hh 110 has a complex structure , probably formed by irregularly shaped shocks which give rise to the observed emission line knots .",
    "the observed spatially resolved line profiles are then the result of a mean motion along the jet flow ( the `` mean flow '' ) combined with the scattered motions resulting from the non - planar shocks ( the `` turbulent velocities '' , in analogy to the standard description of a laboratory jet ) .",
    "the distribution of the radial velocity ( projected along the line of sight ) over the cross section of the jet will then be determined by the appropriately projected distributions of the mean and turbulent velocities .    as a simple parametrization of the mean flow velocity , we assume that it is directed along the outflow axis , and that it has a dependence on the cylindrical radius @xmath112 which is given by a generic taylor series expansion of the form @xmath113 .",
    "one can argue that the first order term should be nill , since it leads to an unphysical on - axis `` cusp '' in the distribution .",
    "therefore , the lowest order function that we can consider is quadratic .",
    "we will then assume that the radial velocity cross section of the jet is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the central velocity and @xmath116 the outer radius of the jet beam .",
    "it is assumed that both @xmath115 and @xmath116 vary along the jet beam only in scales much larger than the jet width .",
    "if the jet axis lies at an angle @xmath117 with respect to the plane of the sky ( moving away from the observer ) , the profile of an emission line for a point within the jet is given by  : @xmath118 ^ 2}\\ , , \\label{jv}\\ ] ] where @xmath119\\ , .",
    "\\label{vr}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath24 is measured across the section of the jet , and @xmath120 along the line of sight ( with @xmath121 on the outflow axis ) .",
    "the line width @xmath122 includes both the thermal width and the turbulent velocity ( the instrumental width could be added as well to this term in order to reproduce observed results ) , and is assumed to be independent of position within the jet .",
    "we also assume that the emitted energy per unit time , volume and solid angle in the line @xmath123 is independent of position ( see cant , raga & riera 2003 ) .    the line intensity at a distance @xmath24 from the jet axis",
    "will then be @xmath124 where @xmath125    one can then compute the barycenter velocity @xmath126 and the line width @xmath127 by carrying out the integrals of equations ( [ vcd ] ) and ( [ w2d ] ) .",

    "we have drawn the curves given by equations ( [ wmin]-[dvmin ] ) on the corresponding plots of figure 8 .",
    "for each section along the jet we have chosen values of @xmath116 and @xmath145 such that for @xmath144 ( when the upper and lower envelopes join , see above ) the model coincides with the value of @xmath99 corresponding to the largest measured scale length perpendicular to the hh  110 axis , which has @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "in other words , we choose @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we then choose a value for @xmath122 so that for @xmath144 the model prediction coincides with the outer point of the observed @xmath97 vs. @xmath128 points .",

    "we can use the obtained values of @xmath145 to calculate the maximum on - axis value @xmath150 ( obtained by setting @xmath134 and @xmath151 in equation [ vcav ] ) .",
    "the resulting values ( which are also given in table 2 ) should be compared with the observations by looking at the on - axis values of @xmath152 in figure  7 . from this figure ,",
    "we obtain @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157  km  s@xmath2 for the five chosen regions .",
    "if we consider the absolute values of the corresponding velocities with respect to the cloud ( which has @xmath158  km  s@xmath2 ) , we obtain @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163  km  s@xmath2 . for knots",
    "a - q , these values lie within 20  %   of the @xmath164 values obtained from the fits to the @xmath99 plots ( see figure 8 and table 2 ) .    also interesting",
    "is the fact that in order to fit the oberved @xmath165 values , we need to include a line broadening of @xmath166  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if we subtract in quadrature the 32  km  s@xmath2 instrumental resolution , we obtain an intrinsic broadening @xmath167  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these values are substantially larger than the @xmath168  km  s@xmath2 expected thermal width , so that they therefore probably reflect turbulent motions in the jet flow .",
    "looking at figure 8 , we see that the observed @xmath97 and @xmath99 mostly lie on the model predictions for averaging intervals centered on the outflow axis ( equations [ wmin ] and [ dvmax ] , respectively ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the wavelets chosen by our knot detection algorithm mostly lie close to the hh  110 axis ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath169 we see that the observed @xmath97 and @xmath99 values lie substantially above the theoretical curves . in particular , the points corresponding to regions that lie further away from the outflow axis ( shown with open circles in figure 8) are the ones that tend to have larger velocity dispersions .",
    "these points can be clearly seen to lie in the outer , high velocity dispersion envelope which is seen in the cross sections shown in figure  7 ( also see section 5 ) .",
    "we speculate that this envelope corresponds to a turbulent boundary layer ( which is not present in our simple , analytic jet model ) with higher turbulent velocities than the central region of the jet beam .",
    "we have obtained a fabry - prot position - velocity h@xmath0 cube of the hh  110 flow .",
    "both the velocity channel maps and the integrated h@xmath0 image show a complex structure of knots distributed in a broadening , more or less conical structure .    given the description - defying complexity of the structure , we have chosen to carry out an anisotropic wavelet analysis of the h@xmath0 image , which automatically detects the position and characteristic sizes ( along and across the jet axis ) of the knots . from this analysis",
    ", we find that the jet first opens out in a cone with a half - opening angle of @xmath3 for distances up to @xmath170 from knot a , and has a constant width out to knot r.    we have then computed the central velocity , the velocity width and the dispersion of the central velocity of the line profiles , averaged over ellipses corresponding to the sizes of the structures detected by the wavelet analysis .",
    "these quantities show that while there is an acceleration of the jet out from knot a to knot q ( in the region within @xmath171 from knot a ) , the line width and central velocity dispersion remain relatively constant .",
    "a more complex behaviour is seen for knots r - s , which could be a reflection of the fact that in this region the jet has a curved structure ( in the plane of the sky , and therefore probably also along the line of sight ) .    across the beam of the jet",
    ", we see that there is a central , low velocity dispersion region with a diameter of @xmath172 , surrounded by a higher velocity dispersion envelope with an outer diameter of @xmath173",
    ". this result could be evidence for the existence of a turbulent boundary layer in the outer regions of the hh  110 jet beam .",
    "finally , for 5 different regions along the jet beam , we have plotted the mean velocity width @xmath97 and central velocity dispersion @xmath99 as a function of the size scale @xmath22 ( perpendicular to the jet axis ) of the detected structures .",
    "we find that these plots show well organized behaviours .",
    "interestingly , we find that it is possible to model the observed @xmath165 and @xmath174 profiles with a simple , analytic model of a turbulent jet ( or wake ) . from a comparison of the models with the data ,",
    "we deduce that most of the observed values can be explained with a model with an axially peaked mean flow velocity , with superimposed turbulent ( + thermal ) motions with a velocity dispersion of @xmath175  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , for characteristic sizes @xmath176 , the observed velocity dispersions lie up to @xmath95  km  s@xmath2 above the model prediction .",
    "we find that these points correspond to the outer , high velocity dispersion envelope of the hh  110 jet ( see above ) .",
    "therefore , in this representation we again see the presence of what appears to be a turbulent boundary layer , which is not present in our analytic turbulent jet / wake model .",
    "finally , we should note that the acceleration observed along the hh  110 jet does not agreee with what one would expect for a turbulent jet .",
    "a turbulent jet incorporates low momentum material from the surrounding environment , which leads to a progressive decrease of the flow velocity as one moves downstream along the jet beam ( see , e.  g. , raga et al .",
    "therefore , the acceleration observed along the hh  110 jet would favour an interpretation of this flow in terms of a turbulent wake , rather than a jet .",
    "this is the scenario proposed by raga et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who modeled hh  110 in terms of a wake left behind by a jet deflected by the surface of a dense cloud , and then pinched off as the incident jet starts to burrow into the cloud .",
    "of course , another possibility would be to have a turbulent jet ejected with a monotonically increasing initial velocity .",
    "if this increase in the ejection velocity were drastic enough , it could overcome the drag due to the entrainment of environmental material , and lead to an `` acceleration '' down the jet axis similar to the one observed in hh  110 .    to conclude",
    ", we would like to point out that this work represents a first attempt to apply wavelet analysis techniques to observations of astrophysical jets . a spectrum of a 2d image with anysotropic wavelet basis functions",
    "is defined in a four - dimensional space ( with two spatial and two spectral dimensions ) , and therefore contains a large amount of information which is difficult to interpret .",
    "the present analysis is based only on a study of the spatial and spectral maxima of the wavelet spectrum ( i.  e. , on finding `` knots '' and their characteristic sizes ) , and clearly does not use a lot of the information present in the wavelet spectrum .",
