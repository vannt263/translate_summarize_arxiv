  "news": "Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard touchingly swapped shirts with Stoke City teenager Oliver Shenton following their Premier League clash on Wednesday night after learning from Peter Crouch that the youngster had recently lost his mother to cancer. Upon hearing the news from his former England team-mate, Lampard approached 17-year-old Shenton after Manchester City's 4-1 win at The Britannia and the pair agreed to swap shirts.

It is believed manager Mark Hughes offered Shenton the chance to be part of Stoke's first-team squad to help cope with traumatic personal week and the youngster took the opportunity. Crouch, who was part of the England squad alongside Lampard at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup, let his former team-mate know the special circumstances and typically the midfielder responded in a most sensitive and heartfelt manner. Shenton (right) was making his debut for Stoke two days after his mother's funeral Crouch (background) told the former Chelsea midfielder of the special circumstances with Shenton",
