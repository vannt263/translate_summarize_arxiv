  "news": "UEFA has adopted a new procedure allowing referees to stop matches for up to three minutes to assess head injuries when a concussion is suspected. FIFA medical committee chairman Michel D'Hooghe sought the approval of UEFA's executive committee for rules that go beyond the existing medical guidance. UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino says the new procedures will come into immediate effect in all of the European football governing body's competitions. UEFA president Michel Platini will oversee a new head injury procedure Infantino says after a match is stopped, players \"will only be allowed to continue playing on specific confirmation by the team doctor to the referee of the player's fitness to do so.\" D'Hooghe said last week that a concussion case occurs on average once in every 20 games. Clubs have caused controversy while allowing players to stay on the pitch after concussion. Last season Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris stayed on the pitch despite being knocked out after a clash with Everton striker Romelu Lukaku.",
