  "news": "By Rebecca English Royal Correspondent PUBLISHED: 08:34 EST, 24 February 2014 | UPDATED: 21:05 EST, 24 February 2014 Zara Phillips has become the first senior member of the Royal Family to sell photographs of their new baby to a celebrity magazine – for a reported fee of £150,000. The Queen’s grand-daughter, her husband Mike Tindall and their five-week-old daughter Mia Grace are today plastered over 13 pages of Hello! magazine, as well as its front cover. The Mail understands senior officials at Buckingham Palace were not made aware of the lucrative deal in advance and, tellingly, a spokesman for the Queen refused to comment publicly yesterday. Zara and Mike appear in this week's Hello! magazine with a placid looking baby Mia lying between them Quiet time: Phillips and Tindall, seen here leaving the Christmas Day service at Sandringham less than a month before she gave birth, have kept a low profile since the birth Zara’s willingness to strike a commercial deal over her daughter – who is 16th in line to the throne – will bring back uncomfortable memories of her brother’s decision to sell his wedding pictures to the same magazine for a reported £500,000. The first official pictures of Mia were taken at Zara and Mike’s cottage on Princess Anne’s Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire and come just days after their publicist denied they were planning to make money out of the birth. Intriguingly, the Mail has learnt the deal was brokered late last week by the Olympic medal-winning equestrian’s management company, Sports and Entertainment Limited, whose managing director is none other than Zara’s brother Peter Phillips. The accompanying interview sees Zara and Mike speak about Mia’s birth on January 17 and even reveal how Zara called her grandmother as soon as she returned home from hospital. New mum: Phillips and baby Mia were spotted enjoying the sunshine at the Barbury racecourse last week Asked whether Palace protocol obliged them to inform the Queen as soon as the baby was born, Mike says: ‘I sent a text to all the family. Zara is very close to her grandmother, so of course she made a phone call once we got back home.’ Former world champion three-day eventer Zara, 32, says Mia is ‘pretty relaxed and happy so far’ while Mike, 35, describes becoming a father as ‘awesome’. The couple also reveal they aimed to conceive in time for a December or January birth as it will allow Zara to compete in August’s World Championships. Former England rugby captain Mike says: ‘I can see that Z [his nickname for Zara] is itching to be out there again.’ Zara also says there is a Shetland pony lined up for her daughter to learn to ride. Checking in: Phillips takes a peek at baby Mia at the racecourse in Wiltshire Zara described her husband, here with her at Prince George's christening, as a 'hands-on' father, while he gushed: 'I still keeping looking at Mia and thinking \"Oh! We made that!\"' Mia's second cousin Prince George was born at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London The interview was brokered by SEL, an Australian firm dealing in sponsorship and client management. Its small London office was set up in 2012 by Peter. Like her brother, Zara has no Royal title or taxpayer funding. She earns a living as a professional equestrian, funding her stables through sponsorship deals with firms including Land Rover and Rolex. Last night a source close to Zara insisted she and Mike had agreed to the deal as ‘international sporting figures’ rather than members of the Royal Family. They said: ‘It [the magazine deal] was not, initially, something they intended to do. The pictures had already been taken by an old schoolfriend of Zara when they were approached by Hello! and agreed to sign a deal. It was all very sudden. ‘I think Zara understands there will be a level of criticism directed at her but she clearly felt this was the best way to approach the level of interest in Mia and, of course, provide for her future.’ But lawyer Niri Shan, head of intellectual property and media and entertainment at Taylor Wessing, warned: ‘This is going to make it very difficult for them to protect the privacy of their baby when she is photographed in the future, outside of any specific issue of harassment.’ This is not the first time Zara or her family have struck a deal with Hello!: Cover stars: Zara features on the cover of Hello! magazine in 2011 (left) and with her ex-boyfriend in 2002 (right) Familiar faces: Zara's father is pictured on the front of the magazine in 1997 (left) and her brother in 2008 (right)",
