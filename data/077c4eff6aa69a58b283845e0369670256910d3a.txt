Authorities found a body in the garage of the home, and it will take several days to determine whether it belongs to MacNeill or not A violent house explosion on Long Island appears to have been carried out on purpose, by a 48-year-old man going through a divorce. Police in Port Washington, New York have not yet named the victim of Tuesday night's house fire at 10 Prosepct Ave, but say homeowner Michael MacNeill is 'unaccounted for'. It will take several days to identify the charred remains found in the home's garage. MacNeill appears to have hinted at suicide back in December, when he wrote a ominous caption on a photo of propane tanks and gas cans he posted on Facebook. 'If you're gonna go out with a bang, might as well do it right with 25 gallons of gas abnd 40 lbs of propane.' MacNeill later explained in the comments that he bought the fuel and propane as reserves for the winter. According to police, the explosion happened Tuesday night after they responded to the house on a domestic dispute call. The officers who arrived at the house said they smelled gas. Inside they found MacNeill's 39-year-old wife Angela and their 2-year-old daughter. Just as they were walking the mother and daughter down the driveway, the detached garage exploded into flames.
