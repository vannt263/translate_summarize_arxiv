  "news": "(CNN) -- Peru's ancient Inca ruins of Machu Picchu should reopen April 1, more than two months after rain stranded hundreds of tourists at the popular spot, the government said. Heavy rain in January unleashed mudslides that cut off roads and blocked a rail line between Machu Picchu and the nearby city of Cusco. Water levels at the Vilcanota River have receded enough to allow repairs to the rail line, said Martin Perez, head of Peru's Ministry of Exterior Commerce and Tourism. \"We expect that starting April 1, we will start to receive the millions of tourists who always have come,\" he said Tuesday. Peruvian officials were forced to use helicopters to evacuate more than 1,000 stranded tourists last month. Authorities estimated that 10,000 people were affected by the rain and 2,000 homes were ruined near Machu Picchu. At least seven deaths were reported.",
