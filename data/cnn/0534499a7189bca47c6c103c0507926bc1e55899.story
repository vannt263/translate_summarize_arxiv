She was found badly burned Saturday night on a rural Mississippi road by first responders after a passerby called 911. \"You couldn't recognize her because she was unrecognizable,\" her father, Ben Chambers, told CNN affiliate WREG. As her car continued to blaze, emergency workers struggled to hear Chambers' final words. She spoke in a hoarse voice, Jay Hale, the assistant district attorney for Panola County said. Did she identify her killer? Hale paused and told CNN that no one was in custody yet, so it's still not known.

Jessica Chambers went to go clean out her car and get something to eat before she was burned alive, her mother said, Authorities have questioned a few people, but no one has been arrested, Hale said. They are also trying to get a call record and data from her cell phone, found at the scene near the town of Courtland in northwestern Mississippi.",
