  "news": "(CNN) -- At least 10 people were killed and more than 100 wounded following a pair of bombings Saturday in the southern Thai city of Yala, Thai media reported. The two blasts were the result of bombs stashed in stolen trucks, Police Lt. Gen. Paitoon Chuchaiya told CNN affiliate MCOT. Video from the scene showed damage to buildings, cars and motorcycles on the street. The blasts set fires to nearby vehicles, including a van, which itself exploded, leading to initial reports of a third bomb, Chuchaiya said. Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said she has been informed of the Yala bombings and has instructed national police chief Gen. Prewpan Dhamapong to investigate the crime scene immediately, according to MCOT. Police investigators believe suspected insurgents are behind the attacks, MCOT said. Last month, a series of bombs detonated in Bangkok. No one was killed in those blasts, and an Iranian suspect was arrested in connection with the incident.",
