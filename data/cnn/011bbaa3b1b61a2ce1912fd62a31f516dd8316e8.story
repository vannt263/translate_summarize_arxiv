Pistorius will be served with an indictment Monday following the completion of the investigation. It's the day that would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death. The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his home.

The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs. Pistorius has started sprinting again for the sake of his emotional health, not for training to compete again, the family said. Steenkamp's uncle: I forgive Oscar Pistorious",
