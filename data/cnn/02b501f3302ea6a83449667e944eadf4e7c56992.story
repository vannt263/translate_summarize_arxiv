After transplant surgery, this farmer has new arms. His condition \"is very good under the circumstances.\" The operation was conducted at the university's \"Klinikum rechts der Isar\" last week, the clinic said in a statement Friday, following several years of preparatory work. The man's condition \"is very good under the circumstances,\" the statement said. \"Now it is a matter of avoiding future wound healing disorders, infections, strong side-effects caused by the drugs and in particular any rejective reaction.\" A team of 40 people participated in the transplant surgery, conducted July 25 and 26. The donor matched the host in sex, age, skin color, size and blood group, the statement said. The transplant subject had lost both his arms at the upper arm level six years ago, and two attempts with artificial limbs had been unsuccessful.",
